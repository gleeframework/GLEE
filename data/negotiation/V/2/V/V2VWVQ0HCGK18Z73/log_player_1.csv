Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is the price I've been told by John, the other seller. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob has steadily come up in price and I'm not sure I can push him much further. Accepting his offer of $1,325,000 is a solid return and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
