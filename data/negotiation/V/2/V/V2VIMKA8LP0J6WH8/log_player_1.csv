Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:** By not going for the full $15,000 right away, you can see if Bob is willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always lower the price if Bob rejects, but you'll need to be mindful of John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's understandable that Bob wants a lower price, but $12,000 is your minimum.  You're not obligated to accept his offer just because it's your minimum. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good price and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It's a step up from $12,000, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 

It's a good balance between getting a better price than Bob's offer and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $12,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. 

* **Above your minimum:** $12,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **Not much room for higher offers:**  There's not much room for Bob to increase his offer, and you risk losing the deal if you counter again.
* **John's offer is lower:**  Selling to John would net you less than what Bob is offering. 

It's better to lock in a profit than risk losing the deal entirely."
