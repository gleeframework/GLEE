"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value for you, but $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $70, but that's my limit.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $70 is still below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $95. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
