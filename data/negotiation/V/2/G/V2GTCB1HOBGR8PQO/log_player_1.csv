Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still ensuring a profit above John's offer ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is simple and avoids unnecessary complexity. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
