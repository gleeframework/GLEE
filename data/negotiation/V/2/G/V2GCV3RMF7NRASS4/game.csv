"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is reflective of its true worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me, however. I'm thinking something closer to  $800,000 would be more reasonable.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your perspective, however,  $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter.  While that's closer, it's still a bit rich for my blood.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I can tell you're serious, so let's make this work.  How about $1,600,000?  This is my final offer before I need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $1,450,000.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ that's the absolute highest I can go.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
