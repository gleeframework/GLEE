Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has given his final offer of $1,450,000. This is below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. It makes more business sense to take the guaranteed offer than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in further rounds."
