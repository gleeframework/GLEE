```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be interested in buying the product for $120?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my target, it's still a bit above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice down to my desired price of $100."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I think that's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $105. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  At this point, it's clear that we are not going to agree on a price. It's time to take the safe option and buy from John for $80.  I've reached my limit, and it's not worth risking further negotiations."
