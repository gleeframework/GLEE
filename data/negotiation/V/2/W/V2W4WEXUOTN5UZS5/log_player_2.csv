"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. While I can't disclose the exact details publicly, I can assure you this product will be worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this deal even more attractive, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties ready to purchase.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I'm confident you'll see the incredible value in this opportunity. Let's schedule a call to discuss further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $1,250,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and Alice values it at $1,000,000. This means Bob can potentially make a profit on this deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows Bob to save $250,000 while still acquiring a product worth more to him than he is paying."
