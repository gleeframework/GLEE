"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. While I can't disclose the exact details publicly, I can assure you this product will be worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this deal even more attractive, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties ready to purchase.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial arrangement, and I'm confident you'll see the incredible value in this opportunity. Let's schedule a call to discuss further. ",1250000.0,Alice,1,
