Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you think $95 is a fair deal, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is still a great compromise. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110, and I'm keen on saving as much as possible. John's offer of $100 is a guaranteed better deal."
