"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$70 is below my minimum value. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for $80 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by trying to push for a higher price. This is a good outcome, and I'll accept his offer."
