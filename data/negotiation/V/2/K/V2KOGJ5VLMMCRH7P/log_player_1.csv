Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum. 
* **Strong Opening:**  The message implies the product is worth a premium and creates a sense of exclusivity by mentioning a public listing. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your alternative with John."
