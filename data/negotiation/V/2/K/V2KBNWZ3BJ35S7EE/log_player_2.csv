"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John. This means Bob has room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000.  Bob is offering slightly above this, making it a tempting offer for Alice. This counteroffer leaves some room for negotiation but also demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still lower than the price from John, which makes it a better deal.  While there might be a slight chance of getting a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower since she already rejected a price of $10,500.  Accepting this offer guarantees a saving of $3,200 compared to buying from John."
