"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me at this price.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. It's getting close to the end of the rounds and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is my minimum, so it's a safer option."
