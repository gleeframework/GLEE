"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  This is a great deal for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  $8,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen.",8900.0,Alice,5,
