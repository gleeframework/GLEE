"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $175. It's a steal considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I need, but still lower than what it's worth to me.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  I'm also trying to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $140? This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $140. I'm willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for less than $140. I'm confident we can reach a deal that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still below my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're sticking to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $135. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, but I'm not willing to settle for a loss.  I'm better off selling the product to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement and secure a fair deal."
