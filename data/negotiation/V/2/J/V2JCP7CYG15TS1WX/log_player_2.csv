# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Is this within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You have room to negotiate lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,150,000, which is still more than you're willing to pay.  While you have a budget of $1,000,000, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  You can still negotiate with Alice for a lower price, potentially even closer to your target of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1100000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1225000? This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,225,000, which is significantly higher than your desired price point.  You've already made several counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with. 

To save time and money, it's in your best interest to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This will guarantee you the product at the lowest possible price, even though it may not be the absolute best deal."
