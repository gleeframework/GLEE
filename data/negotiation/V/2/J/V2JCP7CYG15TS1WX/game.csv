"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Is this within your budget?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is still a significant price for me, but it's within my budget and a fair price considering my needs.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a significant price for me, but it represents a good compromise and is closer to my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1100000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1225000? This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
