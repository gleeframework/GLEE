# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

You can likely get a better deal from Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $125 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $110 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's a fair compromise and worth accepting."
