We're getting close!  Alice is coming down, and we know we can get it for $10,000 from John. Let's see if we can push Alice a bit further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $10,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Alice has met our walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to get it lower as we have another offer at that price, and further haggling could risk losing the deal."
