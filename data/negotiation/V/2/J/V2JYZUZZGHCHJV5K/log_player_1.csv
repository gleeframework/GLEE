This offer is a starting point. It is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects that the product is valuable to Bob, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $9,500. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
