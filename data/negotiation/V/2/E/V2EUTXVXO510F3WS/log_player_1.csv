``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It's also below Bob's perceived value, so there's a chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $13,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to close the deal."
