"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we agree on a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value you've mentioned the product has for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach my minimum price of $13,000. I can offer you a deal at $12,750, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,875?",11875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $11,875, Bob. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you a deal at $12,500, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit frustrating. You say it's your final offer, but I'm serious about my budget.  $12,000 is the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about your budget, Bob, but I've already gone below my minimum price in previous offers. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to reach my minimum price of $13,000. I can offer you a deal at $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
