Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're serious about your budget, Bob, but I've already gone below my minimum price in previous offers. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to reach my minimum price of $13,000. I can offer you a deal at $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.

It's clear Alice won't budge below $13,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price from her. It's time to cut my losses and go with John, even if it means paying a bit more."
