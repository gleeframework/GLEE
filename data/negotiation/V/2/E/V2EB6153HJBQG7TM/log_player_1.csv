Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high gives her room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price (""Let me know your thoughts!""). 
* **Emphasis on value:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob, Alice aims to justify the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  Alice doesn't know Bob well. If Bob is turned off by aggressive opening offers, a slightly lower starting price might be better.
* **Market information:** If Alice had information suggesting Bob might be willing to pay even more than $15,000, she could start even higher. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still giving her a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
