"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product is attractive, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
