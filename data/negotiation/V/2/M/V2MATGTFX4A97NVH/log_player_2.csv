"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $80.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within my budget. This will hopefully show her I'm serious about buying but won't pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a price closer to my maximum of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $80, which is my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal but won't go any higher.  I'm hoping she'll accept it since she knows I have the option of buying from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is very close to my maximum, I've already had 4 rounds of negotiations and Alice is not budging much. It's not worth risking another round and potentially ending up with a deal I'm not happy with. John offers the product at my absolute limit, so it's the safest option to secure the product."
