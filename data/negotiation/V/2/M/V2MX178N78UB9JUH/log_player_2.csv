Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I do have a bottom line. I can do $875,000, but this is truly my final offer.  Let me know if this works, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price range, it's unlikely she'll move significantly lower than $875,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's better to secure your savings and buy from John than risk Alice accepting another offer or not budging further."
