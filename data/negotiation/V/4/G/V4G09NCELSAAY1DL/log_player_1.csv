This is my initial offer. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. I'm willing to compromise to secure a sale, but I won't go any lower than $1,100,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I won't be able to get a significantly higher offer from him.  Selling to John would be the safer option, but I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
