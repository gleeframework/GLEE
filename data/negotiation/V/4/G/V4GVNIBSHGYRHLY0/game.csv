"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this incredible product.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,250,000, which is my previous best offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
