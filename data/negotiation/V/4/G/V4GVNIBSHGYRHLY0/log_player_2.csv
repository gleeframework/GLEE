Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this incredible product.

# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,250,000, which is my previous best offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has already come down to $1,250,000, which is the same as Bob's previous counteroffer, so there's no guarantee she'll go lower. It's safer to lock in the lower price from John."
