"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach an agreement!",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $130 is still a little low for me.  I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I can't go lower than $140.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree once you consider the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",140.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on this price.",135.0,Bob,6,
