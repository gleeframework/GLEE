"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This price reflects its unique features and potential benefits for your business.  Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,750.  This price reflects the value of the product and the potential it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,750, which would be $9,875. Can we meet at this price?",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,875 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
