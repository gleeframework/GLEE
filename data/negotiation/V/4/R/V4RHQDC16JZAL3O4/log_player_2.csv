# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum price point of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** You have a strong incentive to negotiate and try to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you have John as an alternative gives you more leverage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's price:**  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and opens the door to a compromise.

* **Friendly tone:** The message maintains a positive and open tone, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the feedback, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your preferred price point. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and have a safety net with John's offer.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room to find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within your range:** $13,000 is still below your maximum but higher than your previous offer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both parties helps build consensus.
* **Clear counteroffer:**  A specific price is proposed to keep the negotiation focused and moving forward."
