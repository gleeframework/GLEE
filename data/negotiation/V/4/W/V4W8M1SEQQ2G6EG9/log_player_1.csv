Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is a strong outcome. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
