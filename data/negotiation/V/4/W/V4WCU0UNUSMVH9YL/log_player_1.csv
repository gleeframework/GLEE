Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While we're closer, my initial assessment of the product's value remains.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is more appealing than further negotiation with Bob."
