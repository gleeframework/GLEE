Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $20,000.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $18,000. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer, but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer of $18,000. This is a good deal for me, especially considering that John is willing to pay $15,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
