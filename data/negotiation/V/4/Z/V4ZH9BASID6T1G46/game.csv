"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. Can we meet in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,200 is still too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $8,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. Can you meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
