"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a significant saving. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $950,000. This would still allow me a profit and  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
