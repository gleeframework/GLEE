"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can likely get a better deal.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's minimum is $800,000.  
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price.**  

By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a significant saving. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within a reasonable range.** It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price.
* **The message is polite and provides justification.** This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **It sets the stage for further negotiation.**  By stating you're willing to pay a specific amount, you encourage Alice to respond and potentially counter with her own offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $950,000. This would still allow me a profit and  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise.**  It's lower than her initial offer but still allows her a profit.
* **The price is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and this offer is significantly less.
* **There's not much room for further negotiation.**  Rejecting and counteroffering again might risk losing the deal, especially since Alice is willing to meet you halfway. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
