Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $107. How about we meet in the middle at $112? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price!

Alice is very gradually coming down, and we are getting close to her value. It's unlikely further haggling will yield a much better result, and we risk pushing her away entirely.  At $112, we are well under budget."
