"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $8,000 to you.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $7,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $6,800 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $6,600.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",6600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $6,600 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $6,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",6700.0,Alice,5,
