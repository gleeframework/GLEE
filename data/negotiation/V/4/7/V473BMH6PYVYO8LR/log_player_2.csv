"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially with a price as low as $900,000. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate and hopefully triggers a back-and-forth that leads to a more favorable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm going to reject again and try to squeeze out a bit more savings."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again is significant. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
