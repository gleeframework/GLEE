"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value to you, I'm confident it'll be a great asset. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $950000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob should still reject it.  He can likely get a price even lower than $1,050,000 by making another counteroffer. There's still a gap between their desired prices, and continued negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
