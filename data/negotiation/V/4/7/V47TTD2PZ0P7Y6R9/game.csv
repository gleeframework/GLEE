"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000.  It's a steal at that price, considering its true value to you. Let's get this deal done!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,350,000? This would still be a significant win for you, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
