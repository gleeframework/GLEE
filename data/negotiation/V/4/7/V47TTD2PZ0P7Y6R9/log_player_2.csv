"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000.  It's a steal at that price, considering its true value to you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject the initial offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.  There's room for both of you to make a profit, and you have 10 rounds to explore that space."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,350,000? This would still be a significant win for you, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the bargaining going and potentially leads to a lower price.  You're still better off than buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
