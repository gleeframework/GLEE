Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its true value for me, and still gives you a solid profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you placed on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's risky to accept Bob's offer at this point. While it's better than his initial offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to accept it. I want to try and squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to $1,350,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,300,000 is still slightly below my target. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
