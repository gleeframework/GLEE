Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $119 is carefully chosen:
    * It's below Bob's perceived value ($100) making it more enticing.
    * It's still a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum price of $120. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting value and inviting Bob's input to encourage a deal."
