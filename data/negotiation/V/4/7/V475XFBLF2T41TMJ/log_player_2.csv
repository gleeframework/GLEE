Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $130, and it's better to secure the product for $120 from John than risk further negotiation."
