"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value,  $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering your own value of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done. I'll offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,000,000.
