{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is my initial offer.  It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  It's also important to start with a positive message and highlight the value of the product. I want to keep Bob engaged and interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for that low of a price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $100 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $100 and $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
