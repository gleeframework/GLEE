"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $100 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $125? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $100 and $125?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",117.5,Alice,5,
