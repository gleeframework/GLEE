``` 

This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. If Bob rejects, we can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or to go with John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for it, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I can still try to get more. I'll counteroffer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fantastic product that you won't find anywhere else at this price.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose $16500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. It's better to accept his offer and get $16,500 than to hold out and possibly end up with only $15,000 from John."
