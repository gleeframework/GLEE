"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing interest in Bob:** I'm being friendly and indicating I think the product would be a good fit for him. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** By starting at $10,000, I allow Bob to make a counteroffer without immediately feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Setting the stage for a successful negotiation:** This initial offer sets the tone for a back-and-forth negotiation that might lead to a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John's offer of $12,000 as a fallback option, which gives me leverage in negotiations. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Keeping the door open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to counter again, allowing the negotiation to continue.

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum goal of $12,000 while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum goal of $12,000, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $10,000 at this point.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to bridge the gap.
* **Safety net remains:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides me with a secure fallback option.

I'm committed to getting a better price for the product, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. Let's split the difference. How about $9,250? That's a good middle ground and a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth the price, and he'll be happy with it.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum goal of $12,000, but I'm showing flexibility.

By making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price while still getting a decent return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best possible deal we can make.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,100 is the highest yet, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's only a small gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. I can counter with a slight increase and see if we can meet in the middle.
* **John's offer remains a strong backup:**  If Bob doesn't budge, I have John's guaranteed $12,000 offer to fall back on.

I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum goal, especially when John is offering a much better price. However, I'm still open to reaching a deal with Bob if he's willing to come up just a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,150? That's a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final compromise.  $9,150 is close to Bob's offer, and it's also the highest I'm willing to go without losing too much.
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the urgency of making a deal.  The ""Let's finalize this deal"" language emphasizes the need for a quick decision.
* **Finality:**  I'm implying that this is my last offer, putting some pressure on Bob to accept.

I'm hopeful that this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as it's a fair price and I'm showing a commitment to making this happen.  However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
