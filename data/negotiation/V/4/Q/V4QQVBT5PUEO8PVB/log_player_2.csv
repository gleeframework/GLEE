"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than what Alice values the product at ($1,200,000). Bob has 10 rounds and the option of buying from John, so it's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,300,000 is a substantial step down from Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum. This shows Bob is serious about purchasing but wants a fair deal. It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for a better deal. Bob has 7 rounds remaining (and the option of buying from John). It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is a small step up from his previous offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a concession while still getting a good price.  This strategy aims to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
