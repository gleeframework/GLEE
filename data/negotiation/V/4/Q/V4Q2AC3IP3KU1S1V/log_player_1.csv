Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Here's why:

* **Value for Bob:**  At $120, Bob still gets a good deal, saving $30 compared to his perceived value of $150.
* **Value for Alice:**  Alice earns a significant profit of $40 above her minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  This price is attractive enough that Bob is likely to accept, minimizing the risk of having to sell to John at the lower price of $80."
