Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still above his maximum price point. He should try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $8,875 is still higher than Bob's maximum price point, and it's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive. It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
