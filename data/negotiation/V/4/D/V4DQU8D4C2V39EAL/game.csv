"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
