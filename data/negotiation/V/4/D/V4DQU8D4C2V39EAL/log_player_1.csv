"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $11,000 is a solid deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
