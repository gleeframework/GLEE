# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value I believe it holds.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate further, but you're running the risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her price.  If she doesn't budge, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,000,000 is still less than what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price *if* you can assure me this would be a swift and decisive deal.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**
