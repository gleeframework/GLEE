"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value I believe it holds.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,000,000 is still less than what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price *if* you can assure me this would be a swift and decisive deal.  Does that work for you?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
