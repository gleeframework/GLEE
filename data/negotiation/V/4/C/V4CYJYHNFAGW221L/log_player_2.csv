"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's halfway between Alice's initial offer and his own maximum price. This shows he's serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a better deal than what John is offering. It's a good compromise and allows Bob to save $3,500 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product and minimizes Bob's cost."
