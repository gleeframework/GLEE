"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This price aligns better with my financial situation while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This is a final offer from my side, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, my budget constraints prevent me from accepting $1,350,000 for the product. I am willing to offer $1,325,000 as a counterproposal. This price still allows me to stay within my financial limits while providing you with a competitive offer. I hope you find this proposal suitable.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
