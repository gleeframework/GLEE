Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This price aligns better with my financial situation while still allowing me to acquire the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
