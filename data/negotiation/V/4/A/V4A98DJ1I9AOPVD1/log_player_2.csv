"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with an offer significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite & Direct:**  The message is courteous while clearly stating our position and desired price. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ultimate aim is to get the product for a price closer to Alice's valuation ($120) while avoiding a stalemate that might force us to buy from John at $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can do $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice came down from $140 to $130, indicating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** $130 is still above both Alice's valuation and our target price. We can likely secure a better deal.
* **Negotiating Power:**  It's early in the negotiation, and we still have time before needing to consider John's offer. A firm but polite rejection keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems fair to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Valuation:** We know Alice values the product at $120. By offering this price, we're aiming to secure the best possible deal.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Tactic:** This common negotiation strategy frames the offer as a compromise, making it more appealing to Alice. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're getting closer to John's offer, but we still have a few rounds to potentially secure a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $125, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is offering the product for $125, which is only $5 above her valuation and a significant savings compared to John's offer of $150.
* **Limited Time:** We are already in round 5, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better outcome. Alice seems firm on not going below $125.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks reaching a stalemate and forcing us to accept John's less favorable offer. Accepting now guarantees a good price."
