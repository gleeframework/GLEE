"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $110?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $105 is a fair price, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $108.75.  That gives you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",108.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115, as I mentioned before. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $113.50? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",113.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $113.50 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's quality and uniqueness. How about we meet at $112? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",112.0,Alice,7,
