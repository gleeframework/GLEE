"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a very reasonable price.  What do you think about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $12,500? That gives us both a good deal, and you still get the product at a great price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $11,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets this deal done. ",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $11,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - $11,625. That's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",11625.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,8,
