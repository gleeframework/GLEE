Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a very reasonable price.  What do you think about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than selling to John,  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. The product is worth $15,000 to him, and I'm confident that we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $12,500? That gives us both a good deal, and you still get the product at a great price."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident that Bob will pay closer to $12,000.  It's risky, but I'm willing to keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $11,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets this deal done. "", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $11,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a higher offer.  I'm only on round 6, so I have time to keep negotiating and try to secure a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in round 8, and we are running out of time. Bob is offering a price that is a bit below my initial asking price, but is above my minimum value and above what John is willing to pay. Given the limited time left, it is best to accept this offer and close the deal."
