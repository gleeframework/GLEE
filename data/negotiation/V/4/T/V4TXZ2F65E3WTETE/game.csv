"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $16,000 is above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $11,000. This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
