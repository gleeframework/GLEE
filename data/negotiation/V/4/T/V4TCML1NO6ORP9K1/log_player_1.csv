"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategy to see if I can get a higher price, knowing I have a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good deal considering the limited rounds and the possibility of a better offer from John."
