"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle again, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
