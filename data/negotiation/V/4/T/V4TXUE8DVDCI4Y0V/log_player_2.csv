Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle again, say around $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down on her price, her ""final offer"" of $850,000 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice when I can get a better deal elsewhere."
