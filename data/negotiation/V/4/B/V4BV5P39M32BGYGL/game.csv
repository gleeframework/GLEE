"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it still allows you a good return on your investment. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. However, to show you I'm serious about making this deal, I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
