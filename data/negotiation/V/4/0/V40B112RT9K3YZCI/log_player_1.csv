"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm reducing my price, but still significantly above Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can achieve a better price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but keeping it above $1,400,000 which is closer to my minimum goal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a genuine effort to meet halfway, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I believe I can push for more, especially as we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession here, dropping the price to $1,200,000. With only a few rounds left, I need to signal my willingness to close the deal while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm willing to risk the chance of losing this deal to Bob and go with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

With only one round remaining, I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,150,000. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum goal. This shows flexibility, but also signals that I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,125,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum goal. Since I'm in the final round, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's the best option in this situation."
