# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice has come down considerably, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge from her ""final offer.""  $795,000 is a reasonable price and saves me $205,000 compared to John's offer."
