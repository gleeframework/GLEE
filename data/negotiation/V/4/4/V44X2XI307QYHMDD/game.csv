"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $825,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $760,000?  I'm hoping we can make this work!",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
