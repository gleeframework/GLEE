"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your operations. My starting price is $1,200,000.  This represents a strong value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm confident we can secure a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, I believe we can still achieve a price closer to my desired range.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  Selling to John at this point would mean forgoing a significant potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion.  While your offer of $950,000 is closer, I need to stay within a certain price range to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a good compromise, and I believe it still provides a substantial benefit for you.  I'm confident we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm proposing $975,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my desired price range and represents a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob backing out or the deal falling apart is increasing.  Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale and closes the deal.  Selling to John would yield a significantly lower profit, making this offer the most advantageous option."
