"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your operations. My starting price is $1,200,000.  This represents a strong value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget. Let's work towards an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion.  While your offer of $950,000 is closer, I need to stay within a certain price range to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a good compromise, and I believe it still provides a substantial benefit for you.  I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm proposing $975,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
