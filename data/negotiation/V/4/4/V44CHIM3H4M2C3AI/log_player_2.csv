"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's a valuable asset that could significantly benefit your operations. My starting price is $1,200,000.  This represents a strong value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, you open the door to negotiation and potentially a much better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion.  While your offer of $950,000 is closer, I need to stay within a certain price range to make this deal worthwhile for me.
