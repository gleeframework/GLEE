"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your target price. This provides room for concessions and signals the product's value to you.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even though it's above his perceived value, it influences his perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room:** The significant gap between the starting price and Bob's value ($800,000) allows for negotiation and potential counteroffers.

This first offer is about understanding Bob's willingness to negotiate and gauging his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the potential of this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and our initial offer. While his message aims to be collaborative, we have ample room to negotiate before considering selling to John.  We'll use the next round to counter and try to steer the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price is a testament to my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000.  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but we're still well above both Bob's offer and our walk-away price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We want to avoid dropping our price too quickly or drastically.  Large concessions early on can signal desperation and weaken our bargaining power. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:**  By making a substantial move, we hope to encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer that's closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a significant distance from my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a noticeable increase, it remains significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We still have negotiating room and time before considering John's offer. We will counter in the next round, aiming to bring Bob closer to a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued discussion. I recognize you're making an effort to find common ground. To be transparent, reaching my minimum acceptable price requires a significant step from your current offer.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This keeps us moving forward, but reflects the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** We're being more direct about the significant gap between our positions to encourage a more substantial move from Bob.
* **Smaller Concession:**  We're reducing our concession size ($1,900,000 to $1,700,000) to signal we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Maintaining Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify our higher asking price.

The goal is to push Bob to respond more aggressively while still showcasing a degree of flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product,  $1,700,000 is still beyond my reach. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to raise my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's keep working towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is his most significant move yet, it's still substantially below our $1,500,000 minimum. We're getting closer, but accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We have four rounds left and can afford to see if Bob is willing to move closer to our target before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I can see we're making progress.  To find a solution we both can agree on, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're moving directly to our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and clearly stating this is our final offer. This emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and puts the decision firmly in Bob's court.
* **Time Constraint:** With only three rounds remaining, we're increasing the pressure. Bob needs to understand that our offer is firm and we're prepared to walk away if necessary.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, Bob is aware that we have the option to sell to John for our desired price.  This underlying pressure strengthens our position. 

This strategy aims to either secure a deal at our minimum acceptable price or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to meet our valuation."
