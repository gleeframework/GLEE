"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is priced to reflect its value. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
  ""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong offer that's slightly above your ideal selling price. This gives you room to negotiate while anchoring the discussion around a higher value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value,"" we subtly justify the high price without directly revealing our bottom line. 
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's ability to ""exceed expectations"" reinforces its value in Bob's mind. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer is intentionally ambitious. It allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. We are prepared to:

* **Negotiate Down:** If Bob counters, we can gradually reduce our price, aiming to stay above our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Walk Away:** We have the security of John's offer, so we can confidently walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Early Stages:** We are only in round 2 of 10. Rejecting at this stage doesn't risk losing Bob entirely and gives us a chance to steer the negotiation closer to our target. 
* **John as Leverage:** We can use the standing offer from John as leverage, even if we don't explicitly mention it. Knowing we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 allows us to negotiate more confidently."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a price closer to my initial proposal. I could consider letting it go for $1,950,000."",
  ""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Concession:** We are moving down in smaller increments ($50,000) to signal that we are negotiating seriously but still hold firm on a strong valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the product's ""inherent value and potential"" to subtly steer Bob's focus away from his perceived $1,000,000 value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""could consider"" suggests flexibility while leaving room for Bob to counter again. 

**Strategy:**

Our goal is to slowly guide Bob towards a price point closer to $1,850,000 - $1,900,000, which represents a significant profit while still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. We will continue to assess his responses and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value of $1,000,000 and represents a substantial profit for us.
* **Strong Negotiation:** We successfully steered the negotiation from Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,800,000 closer to our desired range.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,900,000 is a strategic win. We've maximized our profit while navigating a successful negotiation."
