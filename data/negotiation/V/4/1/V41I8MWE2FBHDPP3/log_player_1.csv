Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your floor price of $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** There's room for negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in your product's value but open to discussion. 

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned it has to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can potentially get more.  You'll counter with a price closer to your initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. How about $925,000?  This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I think $900000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912500. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $12,500 less than your initial offer.  While you could keep negotiating, the risk of further rejection is higher. Accepting this offer secures a sale significantly closer to your initial target and above your minimum."
