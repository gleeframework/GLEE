"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $1,175,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
