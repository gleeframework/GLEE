"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, your price is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant amount and reflects my serious interest. I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial asking price reflects the true potential and scarcity of this product.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Although she has lowered the price, it is still not within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my reach.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
