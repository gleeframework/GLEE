"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $90 is still a little too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally finalize this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
