{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a decent discount while still allowing me to earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. It also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's work together to get this done."", ""product_price"": 11000}
