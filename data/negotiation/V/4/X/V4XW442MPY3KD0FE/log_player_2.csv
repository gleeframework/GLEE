"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better. He has a ceiling of $15,000, so there's room to negotiate and save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's work together to get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000 and also more than Alice's minimum of $8,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
