"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which would be $12,500. Can we discuss this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
