"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price that allows for a healthy profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another interested party.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
