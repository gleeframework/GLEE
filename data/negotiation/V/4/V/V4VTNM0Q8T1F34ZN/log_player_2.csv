"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $100. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a higher limit:** You're willing to pay up to $120, so you can afford to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Early negotiation:**  Rejecting the first offer signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the value you're putting on the product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $90.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I'd like to offer the product at $95. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while remaining competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she came down from $100, it's still above your ideal price point of $90.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's room for Alice to come down further, especially since she's willing to sell for as low as $80.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting this offer keeps you in control of the negotiation and encourages Alice to make a more attractive offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $92?  That's a fair price for me, and it's still a good profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 92}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and aiming for mutual satisfaction, I am willing to offer the product at $93. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $93 is just $3 above your ideal price of $90.
* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  She's been coming down in price, indicating she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance you could get it down further, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already gone through several rounds and you only have 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate could lead to reaching the round limit and you'd have to buy from John.

**Overall:** It's a good deal considering your initial goal and the limited time remaining. Accepting this offer secures the purchase without exceeding your maximum budget."
