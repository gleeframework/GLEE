Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,112,500? This feels like a fair compromise.
