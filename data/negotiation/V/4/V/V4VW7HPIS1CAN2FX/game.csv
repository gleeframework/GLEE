"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think we can do better than that. Would you be willing to consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,112,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,112,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, which was $1,150,000. That would put the price at $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
