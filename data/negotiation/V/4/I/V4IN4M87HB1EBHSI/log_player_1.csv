{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a starting point that's higher than your minimum value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.**  This approach allows for some potential profit while also leaving space to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It highlights the potential value of the product and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get Bob to consider the offer seriously.** A higher starting price makes him think about the value of the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation.** This allows you to adjust the price depending on Bob's response and potential counteroffers.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John.** If the negotiations with Bob fail, you can always go back to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, but there's still room for negotiation.** Accepting his offer would mean leaving $500 on the table, and you might be able to secure a higher price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to control the negotiation.**  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to you. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option, but not the best choice right now.** You're closer to a potentially more profitable deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you're showing him that you're willing to stand firm on your initial asking price and potentially secure a better deal for yourself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Justification for the price:** The message explains the reasoning behind the counteroffer, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation. 

By offering $9,750, you are aiming to:

* **Close the gap:**  The offer is halfway between your previous asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a profit:** You still get a higher price than selling to John. 
* **Increase the chance of a deal:** By showing flexibility, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum value, but still below what you'd like.** You're only $750 away from your ideal price. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer.**  You can try to bridge the gap and secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not the most profitable.** You're close to a potentially more profitable deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control over the negotiation and demonstrate your commitment to getting closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to get as close to my original asking price as possible. Let's compromise at $9,500. This price is fair, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $9300, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to your minimum value.**  You're only $300 away from your ideal price.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal completely.** Bob is threatening to buy from John, potentially costing you a significant amount of profit.
* **Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.** While not ideal, $9,300 is significantly better than $8,000 from John.

The risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  It's wiser to secure the sale and accept Bob's offer."
