It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She seems firmly planted at a price point above your ideal, and while you could probably squeeze a little more out of the deal, it's no longer worth the time and effort. Buying from John at $15,000 ensures you get the product without the drawn-out negotiation."
