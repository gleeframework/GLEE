"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  As Bob, I'm not going to pay more than $100 for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a steal for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my maximum price of $100. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $160 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $100.  It's the most I can spend. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
