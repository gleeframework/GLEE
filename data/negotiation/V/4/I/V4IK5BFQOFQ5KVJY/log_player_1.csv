Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no risk of losing money. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed profit from John."
