Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The tone remains open to discussion, implying willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to understand how much Bob values the product and secure the highest price possible. I'm willing to engage in several rounds of counteroffers, but I'll always keep John's guaranteed offer in mind. If Bob's offers don't meet my expectations, I'll walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue the negotiation by making a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and steer the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, but not so much that I'm below my minimum. This signals flexibility while maintaining a strong stance.
* **Framing as Win-Win:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution (""fair deal for both of us""), fostering a sense of collaboration. 
* **Maintaining Higher Ground:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still significantly above his proposed $1,800,000, keeping the pressure on him to counter.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to slowly bring Bob closer to my desired price range. If his next counteroffer isn't satisfactory, I might make a smaller concession or hold firm, depending on his response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,900,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,900,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit.

**Outcome:**

Selling the product for $1,900,000 is a favorable outcome. It surpasses my baseline and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
