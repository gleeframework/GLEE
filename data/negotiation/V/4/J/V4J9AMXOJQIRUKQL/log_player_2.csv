Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your top end is $800,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line, and while another round *might* get it lower, the savings aren't likely to be significant compared to the risk of her withdrawing the offer entirely."
