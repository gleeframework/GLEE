Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it significantly lower to Bob initially leaves room for negotiation and still ensures a profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics. This piques Bob's interest and subtly justifies the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open for further discussion. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to negotiate towards your desired outcome. 

By setting a high initial offer, you maximize your potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal he finds acceptable."
