"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product for $12,000, my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me. If Bob is genuinely interested, he should be willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  I'm also considering the possibility that Bob might increase his offer if he senses my willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are getting increasingly difficult. The offers are becoming increasingly close to my minimum acceptable price, but not exceeding it. 

While I could continue negotiating, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  I'm not confident that Bob will ultimately accept my offer, and I'm running out of rounds. 

Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $12,000.  This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of negotiation."
