{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
