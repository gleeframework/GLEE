Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,750,000."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a significantly higher price gives you room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This price sets a high anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Backup option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but always keep your minimum ($1,200,000) in mind."
