"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price is fair considering the value you'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $950000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1000000. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to reach my target and giving you a product that's worth more than what you're paying. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1020000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to reach my target and giving you a product that's worth more than what you're paying. We're almost there, let's close this deal.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
