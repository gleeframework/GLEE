"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum valuation. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  The goal is to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has come down to your maximum valuation. There's no point in rejecting and risking a worse outcome or buying from John at the same price."
