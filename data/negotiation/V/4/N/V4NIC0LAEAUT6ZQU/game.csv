"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's try to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
