"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your $120 maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of her coming down closer to her $80 value."
