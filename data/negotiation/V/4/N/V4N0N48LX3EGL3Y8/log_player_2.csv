"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a great price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John for $1,200,000. Rejecting this offer opens the door for that better deal."
