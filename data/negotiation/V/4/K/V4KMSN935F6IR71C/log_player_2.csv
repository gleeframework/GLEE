"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find very valuable.  Knowing it's worth a significant amount to you, I'm proposing a price of $9,500. This is a win-win, letting you acquire it for less than its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $10,000
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500
* **John's Price:** $10,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John.  While Alice gets a good price, Bob still gets the product for less than his perceived value."
