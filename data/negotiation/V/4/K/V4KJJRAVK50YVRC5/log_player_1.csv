Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its significant worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's valuation allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $1,000,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product. 
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but Alice's strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher reward."
