"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is within your budget, it's worth seeing if Alice will come down on her price. You can always accept her offer later if needed.  You have a better negotiating position knowing John will sell it to you for $150."
