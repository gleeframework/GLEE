Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting.  $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($20).

**Why not higher?**  While you could try for a higher price, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

**Why not lower?** Going much lower reduces your potential profit unnecessarily."
