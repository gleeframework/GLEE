"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $15,500 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  My final offer is $14,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and my original price. I'll offer it to you for $14,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this product.",14750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting tough! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $14,750 is still pushing it. How about we settle at $14,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",14250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,250 and $15,000. I'll offer it to you for $14,625. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in this product.",14625.0,Alice,9,
