"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1450000. This is a fair price that recognizes both our interests.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. While I appreciate your proposal, I'm looking for something closer to $1440000. This price is a good compromise and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1440000.0,Alice,5,
