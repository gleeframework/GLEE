"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get closer to a price I'd consider a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a price significantly lower:** Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appear reasonable:** Offering $85 positions me as willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. It shows I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  I anticipate Alice might not accept $85 outright, so this offer allows for us to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This product is really worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a more acceptable price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. A $15 difference is still significant.  I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still interested, but $100 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $90? That would be a comfortable price point for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual increase:** I'm increasing my offer incrementally to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate and meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason, even if simple,  makes my counteroffer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** While I'm moving closer to her price, I'm still aiming to pay significantly less than her initial offer and John's alternative price."
