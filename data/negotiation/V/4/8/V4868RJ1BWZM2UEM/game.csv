"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it.  However, I'm not able to pay $20,000. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I see the value you see in the product, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
