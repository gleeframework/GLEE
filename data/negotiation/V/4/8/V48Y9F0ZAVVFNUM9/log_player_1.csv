Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase now.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
