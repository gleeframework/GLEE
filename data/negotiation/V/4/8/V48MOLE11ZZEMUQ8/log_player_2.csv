"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, you have no incentive to accept the offer. It's better to reject and see if you can get a lower price from another seller."
