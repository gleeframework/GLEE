{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
