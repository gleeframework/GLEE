You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. However, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John if you reject her offer.  There's a good chance Alice might make a better offer in a counter-negotiation."
