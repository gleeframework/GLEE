Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and ensures you don't undervalue your product. 
* **Justification:** Offering a brief reason, even if it's just highlighting ""quality,"" can make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.  

While we know Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a bit more. This offer aims to test that while still leaving a safety net (selling to John)."
