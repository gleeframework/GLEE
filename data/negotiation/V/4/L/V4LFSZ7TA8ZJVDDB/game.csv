"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for this product. If you're interested in negotiating, I'm open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $1400000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1550000? This is a fair price that still allows you to save some money, while also ensuring I get a good deal. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  While $1550000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is my final offer -  if we can't agree on this, I'll have to purchase from John.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
