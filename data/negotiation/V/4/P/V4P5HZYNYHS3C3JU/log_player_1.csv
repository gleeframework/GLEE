**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently working the price down and is unlikely to agree to a price that significantly exceeds his current offer. While $1,070,000 is a good price, accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed sale at a price that still meets my minimum requirement.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
