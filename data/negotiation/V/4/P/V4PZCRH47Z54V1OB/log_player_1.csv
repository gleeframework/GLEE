"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  Starting with a high price significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly anchors the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to counter, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:**  His counteroffer will reveal how much he values the product and how much he's willing to compromise.
2. **Anchor the negotiation high:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it sets a higher reference point for the rest of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly above his perceived value of $1,000,000.  This suggests there's room for him to move closer to your minimum price. By rejecting and countering, you maintain the pressure to negotiate upwards. You're still secure knowing you have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your proposed price doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings, I'm willing to move closer to bridge the gap. How about we consider $2,100,000? This takes into account the unique benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Shows you're seriously considering his position, which helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Decreasing the price by $200,000 signals flexibility but also holds firm on a price significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** By mentioning ""unique benefits,"" you subtly nudge Bob to justify his lower valuation and potentially reveal more about his budget constraints.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a counteroffer:** You're inviting Bob to meet you closer to your desired price range.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  You're not conceding too much too quickly, demonstrating the product's inherent value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated. However,  $1,900,000 is still a significant profit margin above your $1,500,000 backup.  You're aiming to maximize your earnings, so it's worth pushing a little further to see if you can close the gap even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a number we can both agree on. To be straightforward, $2,000,000 is my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that you're close to your limit.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're connecting it to ""true value"" and a ""fair deal,"" subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $2,000,000 is a strong compromise: 
    *  It's a substantial profit above your backup plan with John.
    * It's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offers, showing negotiation success.
    * It gives Bob a chance to secure the deal at a price he might find acceptable, given his increasing offers.

This approach aims to:

1.  **Prompt a decision:** Bob needs to decide if he's willing to meet your price or risk losing the deal.
2.  **Maintain a strong position:**  You're demonstrating confidence in the product's value while remaining open to closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  While not your ideal price, $1,800,000 is a substantial profit margin above your $1,500,000 guarantee with John. 
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated his $1,800,000 offer twice now. This suggests he might be unwilling to budge further. Continuing negotiations risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a marginally better deal with Bob isn't worth potentially losing the $1,800,000.  You've secured a very good outcome."
