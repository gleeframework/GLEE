Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
