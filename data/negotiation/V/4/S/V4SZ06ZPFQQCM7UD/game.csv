"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,375,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value it brings.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but there's still a gap between our valuations.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a strong offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still pushing it for me.  Her other buyer sounds serious, so how about we split the difference and call it $1,250,000? That's my best and final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
