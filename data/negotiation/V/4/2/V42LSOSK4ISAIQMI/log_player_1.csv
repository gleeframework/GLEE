"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
