Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, focusing on the value proposition for Bob.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to be flexible and adapt your approach based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you're aiming for.  You have a chance to potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $11,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've been considering my options carefully, and I believe I can stay within my budget by purchasing the product from another seller. However, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Thank you for your time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is well below your minimum.  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a better price, and you risk wasting time and potentially losing out on the sale to John. Selling to John guarantees you your desired price and avoids further negotiation."
