"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $11,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
