"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product is truly unique and will deliver substantial value for you. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,400,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for my product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
