Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,650,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,650,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as a positive opportunity.

**Why this approach?**

* **Starting high:** Starting at a higher price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Not going too high:**  I don't want to price myself out of the market right away, so I'm not asking for an exorbitant amount.
* **Focusing on value:** Emphasizing the product's value can make Bob more likely to accept a slightly higher price.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll wait for his counteroffer and respond strategically based on the price he proposes.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round of negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining my value:**  Accepting a price this low would set a bad precedent and potentially undervalue my product in the future.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product is truly unique and will deliver substantial value for you. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,400,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $1,650,000 to $1,400,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for further discussion.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the unique value of the product and emphasizes that this price still offers a good deal for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages further discussion.

**Why this approach?**

* **Showing flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to negotiate increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Staying above the minimum:**  I'm not giving up on my minimum value.
* **Setting a clear boundary:**  The price of $1,400,000 provides a clear indication of my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've reached a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my value:** Accepting a price this low would be a significant financial loss and set a bad precedent for future negotiations.
* **John as a secure alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

**Why this decision:**

* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take a lot of time and effort with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a good price and removes the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,500,000."
