Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. I am still unable to meet you at $15,000 given my budget constraints. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations.

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob or running out of negotiation rounds."
