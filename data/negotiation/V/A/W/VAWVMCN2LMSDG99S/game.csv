"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
