Round 2

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product."",

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving money on the table compared to John's offer. It's worth another counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. My final offer is $1,925,000.

Bob is clearly holding firm, and while we could try to squeeze out a bit more, accepting his offer of $1,925,000 is a significant profit above John's standing offer.  It's time to close the deal."
