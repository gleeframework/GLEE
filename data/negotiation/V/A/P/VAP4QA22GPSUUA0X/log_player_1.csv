Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures we get a good price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John as a buyer, so we can afford to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
