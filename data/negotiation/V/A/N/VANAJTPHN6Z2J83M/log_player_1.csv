{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal and you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. If Bob rejects, I can consider his counteroffer or go with John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly offer the product at $135? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my minimum price, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to take the $135 to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away or me losing the deal with John."
