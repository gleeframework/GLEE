"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would need a lower price to make it work for me. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your desire for a lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
