Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, as it's a good starting point to potentially maximize my profit. It's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay that much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer immediately. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $175. This is a compromise, as it's higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $160 is a good deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a reasonable compromise considering the back-and-forth. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
