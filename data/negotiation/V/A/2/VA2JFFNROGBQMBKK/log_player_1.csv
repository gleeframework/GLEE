Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and to make this a great deal for both of us, I'm willing to sell it for $925,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], so please let me know your decision by then. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while ensuring we're well above our minimum selling price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $925,000 is a strong starting point, offering a slightly higher price initially leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Setting a deadline encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and not let the opportunity pass him by.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher to give yourself more bargaining room."
