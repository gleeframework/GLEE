Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially marginal gain."
