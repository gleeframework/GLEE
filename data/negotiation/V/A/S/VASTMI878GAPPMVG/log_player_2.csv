# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However,  the value of this product extends far beyond standard market comparisons. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get the price closer to my maximum budget."
