"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $180? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170?",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit tight on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. How about we meet at $178? It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",178.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, Alice, but $178 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest one. Would you consider a price of $172?",172.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $172 and my last offer of $178, which is $175. Would you be willing to meet me there?",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $171, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking of selling the product to someone else if we can't come to an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me at $171?",171.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a final concession, Alice. However, I've already stretched my budget to its limit. I'm afraid I can only go as low as $169. Would you be willing to meet me there?",169.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to make concessions, but I need to make a profit. I'm not willing to go any lower than $170. If you're really interested in the product, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I need to be realistic about the price. If not, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",170.0,Alice,11,
