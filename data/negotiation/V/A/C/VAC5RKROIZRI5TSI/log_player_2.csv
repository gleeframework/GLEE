"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $140, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $140.
*  While this is a lower price than John's, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find an even better deal from another seller.**"
