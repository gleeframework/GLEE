Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

This seems like a good point to stop negotiating. Alice appears to be firm on her price, and while we might be able to push her down a little more, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $925,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
