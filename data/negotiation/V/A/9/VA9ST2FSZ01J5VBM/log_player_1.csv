Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and am willing to consider $1,100,000 as a final offer for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. I hope this aligns with your expectations.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll reach an impasse or that the negotiations will drag on.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to him and avoid further potential complications with Bob."
