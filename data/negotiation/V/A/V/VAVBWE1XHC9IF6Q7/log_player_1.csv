Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum price of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives him a good incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still make a profit even if Bob counteroffers. 

Let me know if you'd like me to analyze Bob's response and make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is below what I initially wanted, it's still a good deal. Accepting the offer gives me a profit of $20, and it's likely that Bob wouldn't go lower.  There's no guarantee that I could get a better price in further negotiations, and I risk losing the sale altogether."
