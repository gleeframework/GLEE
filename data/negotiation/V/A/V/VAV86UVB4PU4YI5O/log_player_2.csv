"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her own valuation of the product. This gives some room for further negotiation while aiming for a price that's very good for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still below what I could sell it for elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price and you have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This counter-offer aims for a price that's right in the middle of your last offer and Alice's current offer.  It's a strong negotiating position and is the highest price you're willing to pay before considering John's offer."
