Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and unique features, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and unique features,"" Alice provides a subtle justification for the high price without revealing her own minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is primarily about gauging Bob's interest. If he flat-out rejects it, Alice hasn't lost anything and can move on to John. If Bob counter-offers, it opens the door for negotiation."
