Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit. 
* **John as a Back-Up:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate, so the offer to Bob needs to be enticing.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing profit."
