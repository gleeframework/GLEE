"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13200. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not getting closer to a deal. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's it. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
