"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $9000 for the product. This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $6500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can go right now.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $7250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $8000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product and my need to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",8000.0,Alice,7,
