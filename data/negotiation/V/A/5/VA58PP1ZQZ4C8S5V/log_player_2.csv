Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can work something out.
