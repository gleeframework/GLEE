"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, and there's no room for negotiation yet. It's better to reject and see if she's willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that is still above my target, but closer to it. Since I still have rounds left, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price. There's still room for both of us to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is my final offer before considering John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,125,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that is within my target range and close to my previous offer. This is a good deal for me, and it's better than going to John. There's always the risk that if I reject, she might not budge further, and I might end up paying more at John's."
