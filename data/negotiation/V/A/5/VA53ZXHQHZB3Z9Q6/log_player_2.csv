Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a price that aligns with my investment. I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. This price is still within a reasonable range and allows for some flexibility on both our ends.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
