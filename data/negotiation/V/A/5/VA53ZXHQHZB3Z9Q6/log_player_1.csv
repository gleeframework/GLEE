Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

This price is still within a reasonable range and allows for some flexibility on both our ends.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
