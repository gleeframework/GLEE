"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $825,000 for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
