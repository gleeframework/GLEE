Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a fairly high initial offer, but I believe it's reasonable given that the product is worth at least $8,000 to me.  I'm hoping that Bob will be interested in purchasing the product at this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
