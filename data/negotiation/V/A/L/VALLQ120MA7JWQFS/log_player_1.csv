Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's continue discussing and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counter his offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer,  $950,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the value of this product to you, I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that satisfies both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly closer to my desired price and a good deal for me considering John is only offering $800,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
