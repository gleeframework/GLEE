{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's offer. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is lower than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a lower price, Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly.  This shows Alice he is willing to compromise, while still trying to get a better price.  By offering $1,450,000, Bob is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating that he is trying to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Bob should keep trying to negotiate a lower price, as he still has time and the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price.  This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. Since this is Bob's maximum budget, he's hoping Alice will accept to avoid further negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can then choose to buy from John for the same price."
