Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. It's a truly unique offering, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This is my best offer and represents a significant compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I am very interested in acquiring this product but need to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly stating his upper limit and it's a significant amount over my minimum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer."
