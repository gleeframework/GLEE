"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. It's a truly unique offering, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This is my best offer and represents a significant compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I am very interested in acquiring this product but need to stay within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
