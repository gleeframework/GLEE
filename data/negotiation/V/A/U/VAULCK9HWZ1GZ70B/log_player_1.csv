Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to capture more of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than her asking price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone remains conversational and encourages Bob to engage in discussion rather than just giving a flat rejection.

While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the fallback option secure."
