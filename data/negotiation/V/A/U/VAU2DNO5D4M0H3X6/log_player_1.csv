Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, giving myself room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** While I'm aiming for a profit, I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to listen to Bob's counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium to secure the product, but I'm prepared to counter his offers if necessary.  The threat of selling to John at the $1,000,000 floor price gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. This allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap towards my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $950,000.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product, reminding Bob that it's worth more than he initially suggested.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reframing my offer as fair for both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground and bridge the gap between our current positions. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about a deal while still maintaining a degree of leverage. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial target. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy and potentially move closer to the $1,000,000 floor price or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $925000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Would you be willing to accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.  It's better to accept his offer and close the deal rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price or a deadlock.

**Strategy:**

While I'd ideally like to secure a higher price, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential gains from continuing to negotiate. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
