"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950000.  It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $925000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Would you be willing to accept this offer?,925000.0,Bob,4,
