This offer starts at a price slightly above my minimum of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  By asking what Bob thinks, I encourage him to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $85 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That way, I can still save some money and you'll still make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $87.5 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and I'm happy to close the deal."
