"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you. My asking price is $1,400,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my financial constraints. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction from Alice's price. It acknowledges the product's value while staying within your budget. This aggressive approach encourages Alice to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate allows you to potentially get a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be a premature decision, as further negotiation could potentially yield a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the product's value and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move:

* **Meeting Alice halfway:** It's a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's last offer.
* **Reaching your limit:** It states your maximum price, conveying your seriousness and potential for a quick deal.
* **Strong justification:** The message highlights the product's value while emphasizing your budget limitations. 

This strategy aims to pressure Alice into accepting your offer or making a counteroffer closer to your limit."
