"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to pay a significantly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but $8,500 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price and his maximum budget.  It's better to continue negotiating to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and he should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to buy this product, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm offering $11,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope you can see that it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I can see you're really interested in the product. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is a significant reduction from her initial price, it's still outside of Bob's ideal price range. He should continue to negotiate to try and reach a more acceptable price, as he still has rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $12,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. He has only one round remaining and Alice's final offer is still above his ideal price. Given the time constraint and the availability of a cheaper alternative,  it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000."
