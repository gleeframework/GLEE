"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",10800.0,Alice,3,
