"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to buy the product without going over budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
