"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to buy the product without going over budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me my desired profit, and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's also a fair price for both of us, and it allows Bob to buy the product within his budget."
