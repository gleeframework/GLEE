"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $900000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $850,000.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further."
