"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still not the lowest possible.  Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $10,800 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $10,600.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,600. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $10,700 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,500.
* **Limited Rounds:** Bob has already used several rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that he could exhaust all his rounds before reaching a better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** While buying from John is an option, it would cost more ($12,000). 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of not finding a better price within the limited rounds."
