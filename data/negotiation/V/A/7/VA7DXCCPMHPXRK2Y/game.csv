"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $900000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
