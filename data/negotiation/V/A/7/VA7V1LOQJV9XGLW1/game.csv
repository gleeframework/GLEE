"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $13250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,5,
