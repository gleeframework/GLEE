"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product for $1,500,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can get the same product from John for less, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,050,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I can get the same product from John for less, so it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and move forward with John's offer."
