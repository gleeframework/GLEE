"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is much higher. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the transaction.  Otherwise, I have another buyer lined up at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage the offer from John and potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or secure the product for $8,000 from John."
