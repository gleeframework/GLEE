Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, justifying the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
