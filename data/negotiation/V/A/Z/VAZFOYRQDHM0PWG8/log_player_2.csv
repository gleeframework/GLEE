"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's valuation. There's room for negotiation. You should reject the offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's valuation ($80) but well below our maximum price ($120). This gives us room to negotiate while aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. $95 is closer to our limit than it is to Alice's valuation. We'll reject this offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That seems fair."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're proposing a price directly between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below our maximum."
