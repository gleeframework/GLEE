"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $100 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That seems fair.",90.0,Bob,4,
