Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. I'm asking for $900,000, a price that reflects its value and potential.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the $800,000 from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $850,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin and allow me to secure a fair return on my investment.  Let's continue to work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the highest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is offering. While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
