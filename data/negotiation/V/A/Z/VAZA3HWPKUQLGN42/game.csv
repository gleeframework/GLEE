"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. I'm asking for $900,000, a price that reflects its value and potential.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $850,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin and allow me to secure a fair return on my investment.  Let's continue to work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the highest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
