Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
