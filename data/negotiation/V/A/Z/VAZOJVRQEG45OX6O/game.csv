"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
