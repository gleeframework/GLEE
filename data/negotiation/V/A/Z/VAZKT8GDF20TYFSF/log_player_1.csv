"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  It's friendly and sets a positive tone. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high because I want to maximize my potential profit. I'm aware that Bob may not accept this price, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  The message aims to be friendly and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.

**Reasoning:**

While I want to make a deal, selling to Bob for $120 would result in a substantial loss for me.  It's more advantageous to continue negotiating or to sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140:** This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. It's closer to my desired price and allows for potential negotiation in future rounds if needed.
* **Message:** It acknowledges Bob's offer and proposes a middle ground, appealing to fairness and mutual benefit.

**Reasoning:**

While I'm not willing to sell for $120, I'm open to negotiation. Offering $140 keeps the conversation going and leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.

**Reasoning:**

While I want to make a deal, selling to Bob for $130 would result in a loss. It's more advantageous to continue negotiating or to sell to John for a much better price.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not yet willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135:** This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  It's a small decrease, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's negotiation and emphasize fairness to encourage acceptance.

**Reasoning:**

I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but still want to maximize profit.  By offering $135, I'm giving Bob a slight concession while still leaving myself some room to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $135. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation.  I've already made concessions, and Bob's offers are still too low.  It's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John at $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
