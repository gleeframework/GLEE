"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a good profit for myself. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, hoping to increase his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss.  I will counteroffer to try and secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to secure a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
