"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have plenty of rounds left to explore a more reasonable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given its value to you at $1,500,000, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit while being within my range.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Its unique features and market demand justify a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a more balanced compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget.  You're aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. There are still many rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can bridge the gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and allows you a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm willing to make this my final offer: $1,475,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, considering the true value and potential of this product. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,475,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to your desired price, you have rounds left and can potentially negotiate a lower price. You should continue negotiating to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000, which represents a considerable increase from my last offer and leaves significant profit margin for you. I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
