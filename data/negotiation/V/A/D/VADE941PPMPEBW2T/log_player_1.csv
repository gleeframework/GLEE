Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your discerning taste.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers eager to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Time Factor:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price isn't absurdly high, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong chance of selling the product if he declines."
