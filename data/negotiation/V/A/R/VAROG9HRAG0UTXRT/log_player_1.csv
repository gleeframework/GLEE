Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially swaying Bob even though the price is slightly above his perceived worth.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I make a profit of $14,500 (better than $15,000 from John).
* **If Bob rejects:** I can still sell to John at $15,000, achieving my minimum desired outcome."
