"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a significant discount from your original offer and is closer to my desired price point. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your desired price point and the product's true value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000.  This represents a significant discount from your original offer and is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
