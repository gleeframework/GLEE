"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm sure it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
