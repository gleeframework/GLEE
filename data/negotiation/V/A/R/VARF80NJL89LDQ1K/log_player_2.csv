"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm sure it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  This counteroffer is a smaller reduction from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting close to your ideal price range.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and further haggling may risk a stalemate or lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a significantly worse deal than accepting Alice's offer.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even if you could get a slightly lower price, the potential benefit may not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether or delaying the purchase.  A good relationship with Alice could lead to future opportunities."
