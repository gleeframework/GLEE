"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $10,000.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  The product is interesting, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.  It's a good strategy to start low but not insultingly so."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met our alternative price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a lower price, and we risk Alice retracting this offer. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
