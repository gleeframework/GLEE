"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but her offer is $95, which is still above your ideal price point.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you can start a counter-offer process to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum (likely $80). 
* **Reasonable counter:** $85 is a good starting point as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open communication:** Including a message shows you're willing to negotiate and helps build rapport."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your target, $90 is still above your preferred price.
* **Continuing negotiation is beneficial.**  You have more rounds available, and you can likely get a better price with further negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a backup.** If you reach a point where negotiation stalls or time runs out, you can always buy from John, but it's better to try and save money by continuing to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering a compromise price of $87.50 shows you're serious about making a deal and signals a willingness to be flexible.
* **Reasonable offer:** $87.50 is closer to Alice's likely minimum price, making it a more appealing option for her.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""finalizing the deal"" helps to keep the negotiation constructive."
