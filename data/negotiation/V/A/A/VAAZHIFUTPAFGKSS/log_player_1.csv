Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $87.50. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $80, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation already."
