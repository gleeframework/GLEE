"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $95, which would be $97.50. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
