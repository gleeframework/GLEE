"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to get it cheaper from someone else, but there's no information to suggest that."
