"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know the value of the product to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $500,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low counteroffer allows me to gauge how flexible Alice is on price. While this is a significant difference from her initial offer, it leaves me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice decreased her offer significantly, but it's still above John's price. I'll reject and counteroffer to see if I can negotiate closer to my target price or John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $650,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about buying."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $650,000 is a significant jump from my previous offer, but still below both Alice's last offer and John's price. This keeps me in a strong negotiating position. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""seriousness about buying"") to make it more compelling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $650,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my bottom line. It's equal to John's offer, so there's no benefit to delaying further or risking the deal falling through."
