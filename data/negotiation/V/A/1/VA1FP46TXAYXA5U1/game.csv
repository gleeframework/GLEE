"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Based on its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Could we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we land at $925,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to find a way to make this work. $925,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
