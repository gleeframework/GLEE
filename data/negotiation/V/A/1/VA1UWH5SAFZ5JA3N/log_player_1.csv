Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, but I'm prepared to go lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell for $80, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial price. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer and is a good compromise.  It's also better than selling to John for $80."
