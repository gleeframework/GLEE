"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is certainly intriguing, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's benefits. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",795000.0,Alice,5,
