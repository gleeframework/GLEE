"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too large. To make this work, I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way to $900,000. I think this price is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $950,000 is just a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $910,000.  This allows me to get the product and hopefully leaves you with a satisfying profit.",910000.0,Bob,8,
