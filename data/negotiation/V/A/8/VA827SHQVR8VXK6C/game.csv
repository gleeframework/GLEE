"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to sell the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $1,010,000? That's a compromise I can live with.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
