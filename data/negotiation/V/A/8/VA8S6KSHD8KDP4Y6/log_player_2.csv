# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, so it's a better deal than John's.
* However, you know Alice values the product at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. 
* Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as she emphasized finding the ""right owner.""  

By rejecting this offer, you increase the chances of Alice coming back with a lower price, closer to her valuation."
