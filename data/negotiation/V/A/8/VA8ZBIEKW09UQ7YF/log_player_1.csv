"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there is potential for a deal to be made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident that Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay more than $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value, but I'm acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range of my minimum acceptable price and  close enough to my desired price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and ending up selling to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale at a decent price."
