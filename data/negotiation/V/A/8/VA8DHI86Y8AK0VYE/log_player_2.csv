Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, but there is still room to negotiate. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's now getting risky to keep rejecting. You are only $1,800 away from your maximum price with John, while there is no guarantee that you can negotiate Alice down further. It's safer to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer."
