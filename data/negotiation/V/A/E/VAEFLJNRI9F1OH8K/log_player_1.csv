Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
