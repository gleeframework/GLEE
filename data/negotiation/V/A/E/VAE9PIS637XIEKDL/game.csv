"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,200,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
