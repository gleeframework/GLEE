"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiations and try to get a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has tremendous value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  $1,900,000 is too expensive for Bob, making rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations the best option."
