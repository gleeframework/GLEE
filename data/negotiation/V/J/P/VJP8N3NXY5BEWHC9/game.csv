"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings you'll receive by selling it quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits of acquiring it. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
