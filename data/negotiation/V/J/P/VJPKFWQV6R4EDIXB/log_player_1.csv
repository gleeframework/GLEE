"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1400000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting a bit concerned that I might not reach my desired price, $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round, but if things don't improve, I might have to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope it shows my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1150000, but I'm still a bit away from that number. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of rounds and John is a tempting backup, I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. $1,075,000 is still too low, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm going to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,125,000.  This price is closer to your offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value you'll find in the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product, which is the same offer I made in round 6. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I can convince Bob to come up to my desired price. It's better to secure a deal with John and ensure I get at least my minimum asking price."
