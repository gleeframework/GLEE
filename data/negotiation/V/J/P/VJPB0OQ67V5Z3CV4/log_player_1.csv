"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Positive Messaging:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage with the offer and potentially see the value in the product.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being squeezed too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. I am willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value.** While this is a safe option, there's still potential to get a better price. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal that I'm not desperate to sell at this price and that I'm willing to negotiate further. This could encourage Bob to raise his offer.
* **Ten rounds to play:**  I still have nine rounds left, giving me ample time to find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair price. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial $15,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Midpoint Offer:**  The new price is a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer, making it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone, emphasizing my willingness to work with Bob. 
* **Remaining Flexibility:**  This price still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is $1,000 above my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited time:**  We're now in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left.  There's a risk that further negotiation could drag on and lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** Even if I reject, there's no guarantee Bob will raise his offer again. He may stay at $11,000.

While a higher price would be ideal, accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
