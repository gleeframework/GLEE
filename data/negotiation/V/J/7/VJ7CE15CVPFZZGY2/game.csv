"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is limited to $800000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1000000. Could we possibly find a middle ground closer to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't cover the value I've invested in this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a final offer, as going any lower would be a significant loss for me. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $900000, but I still feel that this might stretch my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $850000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works well for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
