Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a safety net of $800,000 with John, Bob's higher valuation ($1,500,000) presents a chance to earn significantly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a compelling discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message's tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer if the price is set too high."
