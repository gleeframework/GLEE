Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer of $1,000,000. I am still unable to meet that price. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, holding on for a potentially slightly better offer from him isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to move on to the sure thing."
