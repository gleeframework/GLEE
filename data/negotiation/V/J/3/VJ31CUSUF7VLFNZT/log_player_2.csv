"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but still below its worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  It's a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also taking into account your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is still below what Bob is willing to pay from John ($1,500,000) and also a good deal for Bob as he can get the product for a lower price than he expected.  Therefore, it is a good strategy to accept this offer."
