Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.
