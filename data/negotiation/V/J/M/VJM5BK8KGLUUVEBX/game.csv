"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, and I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know you're serious about closing the deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
