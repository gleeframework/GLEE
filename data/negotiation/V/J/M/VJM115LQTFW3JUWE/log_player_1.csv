"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering the return you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a brief justification focusing on the ""value"" and ""potential"" to make the price seem reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a safe $1,200,000, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the initial rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial ask. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the real worth you'll gain from this investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's lowball offer.  I'm holding firm above the $1,300,000 midpoint to signal my product's worth.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition, focusing on the tangible ""gain"" Bob will experience.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession of $100,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and my initial offer of $1,225,000. Can you consider $1,287,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving in the right direction, his offer is still too close to my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and secure a price closer to $1.3 million. I'm hoping that by consistently countering, Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and will make a more significant jump in his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value you're getting while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly above the exact midpoint between our previous offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a strong price.
* **Combined Justification:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's ""budget considerations"" while reiterating the ""value"" proposition to keep both factors in play.
* **Time Pressure:** As we're over halfway through the rounds, I'm applying subtle pressure by suggesting a ""fair price"" to encourage a quicker close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Price:**  $1,300,000 is a solid price, exceeding my minimum and providing a significant profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is unlikely to outweigh the risk of Bob walking away or stalling.
* **Time Factor:** With only a few rounds remaining, accepting this offer provides certainty and avoids the risk of having to settle for John's lower offer at the last minute."
