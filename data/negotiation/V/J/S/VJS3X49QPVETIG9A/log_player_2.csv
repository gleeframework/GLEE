"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially do better. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You have room to negotiate since your maximum is $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is still a good deal for Alice since she's willing to sell for $8,000. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but it's still within my budget of $15,000. This should incentivize Alice to negotiate further, potentially leading to a final price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is only slightly better than her initial offer of $12,000.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, I can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $12,500.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a lower price. It's a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice some room to profit while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $15,000. While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm starting to run out of room for negotiation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price within my budget.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and potentially walking away from the deal, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price."
