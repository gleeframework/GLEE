"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You can save $150,000 by going with John."
