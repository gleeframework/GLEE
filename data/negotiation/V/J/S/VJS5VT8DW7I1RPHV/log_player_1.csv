Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your backup offer. Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, you have a strong position.  You should aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also maximizes your potential profit.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** It's friendly, acknowledges the value to Bob, and expresses a desire for a win-win deal.
* **The Price ($1,350,000):** 
    * This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), giving you room to negotiate.
    * It's still a substantial discount from John's offer ($1,500,000), making it attractive to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
