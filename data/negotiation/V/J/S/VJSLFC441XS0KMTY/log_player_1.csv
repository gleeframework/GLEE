Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Here's why this strategy is optimal:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially still landing you a higher price than John's offer.
* **Respecting Bob's Time:** A direct and clear offer respects Bob's time and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth.

This offer balances ambition with a realistic chance of acceptance."
