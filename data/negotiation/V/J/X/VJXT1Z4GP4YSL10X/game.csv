,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,4,
