"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's an offer you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You still save money:**  Even at $1,200,000, you are getting the product for less than your maximum value of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $300,000."
