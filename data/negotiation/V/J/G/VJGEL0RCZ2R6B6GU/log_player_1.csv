{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I'm still confident we can reach a price closer to my target.  I have a few rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for a price that low. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is getting further away from my desired price. I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement in the remaining time. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk ending up with nothing."
