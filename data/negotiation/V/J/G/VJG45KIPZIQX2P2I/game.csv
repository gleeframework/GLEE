"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great price, considering the product's value and quality.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd be willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value and quality.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stretch your budget as far as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, but $12800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might have to walk away and buy it from John for $10000, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,6,
