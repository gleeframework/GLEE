"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: While $130 is a decent price, it's still above your personal value of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice's counteroffer of $120 is still above your value, but it's much closer.  It's better to accept this offer and save $30 compared to buying from John.  You might be able to get it down even further, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers means you're likely to end up paying more."
