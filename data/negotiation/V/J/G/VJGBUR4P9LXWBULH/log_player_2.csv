"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite close to my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me in the middle, and $11,000 is a reasonable price. It's close enough to my goal, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal."
