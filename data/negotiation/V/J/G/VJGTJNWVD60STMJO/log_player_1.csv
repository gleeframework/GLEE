While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the increments are getting smaller and he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a satisfactory outcome. Selling to John guarantees the minimum price and avoids further time spent in potentially fruitless negotiations."
