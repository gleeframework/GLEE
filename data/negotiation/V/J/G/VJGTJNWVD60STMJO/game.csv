"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to your valuation, it's still a significant gap from what I consider fair.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product.",960000.0,Bob,6,
