"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $10,000, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a special price, as I know it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,1,
