"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,300,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your ideal price, but it's closer to your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get it lower. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $1,200,000. This is still within your budget, and while you'd prefer a lower price, it's the best you're likely to get from Alice. Buying from John would be more expensive, and further negotiation might not result in a better price."
