"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,300,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
