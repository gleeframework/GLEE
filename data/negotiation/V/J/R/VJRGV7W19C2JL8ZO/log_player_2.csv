"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is looking to pay no more than $12,000, and Alice's offer is $3,000 higher than his maximum.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $12,000, but I have to make a profit. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. It's a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He is willing to pay $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so there is room to find a price that works for both of them."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product and think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $13,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $12,000.  While he could continue to negotiate with Alice, he is guaranteed to get the product for his maximum price by buying from John. There is no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice, as the chance of her lowering her price to $12,000 or less is uncertain."
