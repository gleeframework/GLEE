"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm really interested in the product and think this would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $13,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13500.0,Alice,5,
