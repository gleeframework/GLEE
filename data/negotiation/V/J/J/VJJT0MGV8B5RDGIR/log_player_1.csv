Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** The message highlights the potential value for Bob while emphasizing the fairness of the price for me.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer and am prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your asking price, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm aiming for a deal, I can't accept $8,000 as it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and a potential middle ground.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a lowball offer.

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $8,000 simply isn't enough for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's initial offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** The price of $9,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the new price, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Keep John's Offer in Mind:** This counteroffer still leaves me with the option of selling to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects it again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,500 as a counteroffer. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $10,000 threshold.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and a higher counteroffer could potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, so I can afford to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his last offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $8,750? This is a compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant move from my previous position, showing that I'm genuinely trying to reach a deal.
* **Midpoint Offer:**  The $8,750 price is exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This signals a strong commitment to finding a solution.
* **Urgency & Finality:** The message emphasizes the desire to close the deal, subtly implying that further negotiation may be unlikely.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer and am prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this final concession."
