"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your asking price, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $8,000 simply isn't enough for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,500 as a counteroffer. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $8,750? This is a compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
