{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  With only one round remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate a better price.  It's better to take the guaranteed price from John, even if it's my maximum budget.  I'd rather secure the product than risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
