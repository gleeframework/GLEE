"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$8,000 is far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. It's a fair starting point and hopefully, Bob will see that it's worth his while to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I still have time to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $11,000. It's a compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still have rounds left and I'm hoping for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,800. It's a small step closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to meet my minimum value of $12,000. It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
