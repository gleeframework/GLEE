"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $130?  It's a fair price for both of us and I'd be happy to purchase it.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $140?  It's a good price for both of us and I can get this deal done.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $140, which would be $150. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet you at $145. That's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to make this deal happen.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $152. It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,7,
