{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. You can definitely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price. This is still within the range of what the product is worth to me, and it leaves room for negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not low enough. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm not desperate yet."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer slightly, but still leaving a decent gap between my offer and Alice's price. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not going to overpay. With a few rounds left, I'm feeling confident that we can reach an agreement."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Buying from John would cost significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially responsible choice at this point."
