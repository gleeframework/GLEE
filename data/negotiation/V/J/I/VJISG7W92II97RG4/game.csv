"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer on the lower end of the spectrum.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
