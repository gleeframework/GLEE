"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13000? It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product",13000.0,Alice,5,
