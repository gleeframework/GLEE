Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on the price just yet, Bob. I can do $79, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while I could try another counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  $79 is a reasonable price and a decent savings compared to John's offer."
