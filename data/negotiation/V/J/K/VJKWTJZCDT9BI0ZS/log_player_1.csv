Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $150, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can always lower it a bit, but it's better to start high and see if he's willing to meet you in the middle.  You also have the safety net of selling to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a good price, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price point.  Since you have the option to sell to John for $80, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
