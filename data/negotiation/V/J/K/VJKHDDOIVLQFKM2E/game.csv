"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at least $10,000.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm really close to taking John's offer of $10,000, but I'm willing to give you one last shot.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  It's a fair compromise, and it lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, could you perhaps lower the price to $8,900?",8900.0,Bob,6,
