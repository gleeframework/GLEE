"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to John's offer as possible. A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also unwilling to pay the full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to bridge the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer. A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing Bob is willing to pay a premium over John's offer but still wants a significant discount from Alice's previous price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has offered the same price as her initial offer.  This suggests that Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Given that Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
