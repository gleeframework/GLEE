Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I've set the initial price at $15,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I've included a phrase letting Bob know I'm open to discussing the price.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation and leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Try to get a better price:**  I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's real interest:**  His willingness to negotiate further will reveal how much he values the product.

If I'm not able to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000.  This would still be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've offered a price that's halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Reasoning:**  The message highlights the fairness of the new price for both parties.
* **Openness:**  I've ended with a question to encourage further negotiation and gauge Bob's response.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate with him, the potential for a better price is limited. 

Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees me my minimum value, and is a more secure and efficient option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
