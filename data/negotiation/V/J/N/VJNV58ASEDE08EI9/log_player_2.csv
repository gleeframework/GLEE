"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves room for profit.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit and is closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and leaves a comfortable margin for Bob.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a much lower price, so accepting the offer is the most sensible option."
