This represents a significant value for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1,200,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
