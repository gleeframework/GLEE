"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I've seen similar products in the $9,000 range. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This still reflects a slight premium over its intrinsic value of $10,000, but it's closer to what you're suggesting. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
