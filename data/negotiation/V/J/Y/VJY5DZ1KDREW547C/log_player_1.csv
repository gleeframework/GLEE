Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. There's a chance Bob might accept a price slightly lower than my guaranteed offer, netting me an even larger profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. However, it leaves room for negotiation while conveying the product's high worth.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and desirability. This might nudge Bob towards accepting before he potentially loses the deal."
