Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $130 is less than Bob's valuation of $150, making it potentially attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for some potential negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a better price than John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum price, it's worth exploring if you can get a higher price. There's still potential for a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your initial price of $130. This could lead to a more favorable outcome for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Appealing to Value:**  The message highlights the product's value and emphasizes the discount offered.
* **Open for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to pay $115.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has repeatedly insisted on $100, and you've already made a significant concession by lowering your price to $115.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a higher price.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees you your minimum, preventing you from losing any money.  While it's not ideal, it's a practical decision to ensure a sale and secure your minimum profit."
