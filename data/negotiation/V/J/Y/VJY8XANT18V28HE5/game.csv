"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it, but I need to stay within that range to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product to you for $1600000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget concerns. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still above my maximum. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer the product to you for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1520000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1450000, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
