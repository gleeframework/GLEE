Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to her product's value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below her absolute minimum allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates, even if Alice is firm on the price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a strong safety net for Alice. She doesn't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable losing the sale to Bob if he rejects the initial offer. It prioritizes maximizing potential profit."
