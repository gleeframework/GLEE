"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the product is a bit overpriced at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $60, we are aiming significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Justification:**  While we don't explicitly say why we think $60 is fair, implying that we find the product's value lower encourages Alice to potentially meet us closer to our price.
* **Polite and Open:** We maintain a polite and open tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice lowered her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** $75 is still significantly higher than our target price. We need to show Alice we're serious about a lower price.
* **Alternative:** We have the option to buy from John for $100, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $60 is low, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $67?"",
""product_price"": 67
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  A common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows we're willing to move up, but still want a significant discount.
* **Specific Number:** Offering a specific, slightly unusual number like $67 can sometimes make the offer feel more considered and less arbitrary. 
* **Pressure:**  By moving up only slightly, we're putting a bit more pressure on Alice to make the next significant move if she wants to make the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $67 is still a little low for me. Let's compromise at $70. That's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $70 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Negotiating further might only yield small gains, and risks the deal falling through. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now saves us the time and effort of continued negotiation or going with John."
