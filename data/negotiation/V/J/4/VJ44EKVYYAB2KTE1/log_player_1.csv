Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your absolute bottom line, vaguely mentioning the product's benefits to Bob aims to justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price,  giving Bob a chance to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

By starting with a higher offer, you maximize your potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
