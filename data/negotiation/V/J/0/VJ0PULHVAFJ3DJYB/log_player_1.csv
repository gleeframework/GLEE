Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's value.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back and forth that could lead to a higher sale price."
