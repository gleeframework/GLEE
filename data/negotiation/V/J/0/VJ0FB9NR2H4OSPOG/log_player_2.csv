"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial price, Bob can still do better. He knows John is willing to sell for $8,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to John's price as possible without risking losing the deal with Alice.  Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's last offer and a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing and forcing him to buy from John at a slightly higher price."
