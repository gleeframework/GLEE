"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle ground between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting for Now:** While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **More Negotiation:** By rejecting, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's counteroffer ($8,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll get at this price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using positive language and suggesting we close the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $8750. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room to improve the price.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I'm confident I can get a better offer.  By rejecting, I can continue negotiating and try to push Bob a bit higher.
* **John's Offer:** With John's $8,000 offer as a safety net, I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,875. This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This strategy helps show that I'm willing to compromise while still seeking a price closer to my target.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and leaves no room for misinterpretation, focusing on the price and the desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair and a good deal for both of us, which can encourage Bob to accept."
