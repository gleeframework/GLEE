"Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I can't go lower than $109. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal and move on.",109.0,Alice,5,
