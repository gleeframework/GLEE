Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for $105 yet, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to maximize my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I can't go lower than $109. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $108.  I think this is a fair price considering both of our positions. Let's make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $110,  $108 is a decent price and I'm getting close to the end of the rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $100."
