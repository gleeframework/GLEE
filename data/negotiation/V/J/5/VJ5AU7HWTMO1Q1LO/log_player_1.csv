Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, starting higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum ($10,000) but lower than your initial offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a sale at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in the negotiation and that Bob isn't completely turned off by a higher initial offer."
