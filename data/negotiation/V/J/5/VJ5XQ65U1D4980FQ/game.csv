Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you'd consider $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $140 for it.  If that works for you, let's do it.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Alice,5,
