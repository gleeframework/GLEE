Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value, considering the product's potential and the fact that I have other purchase options. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but the $850,000 price doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. As I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly rooted at $850,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to an acceptable price for me. It's time to move on to John who's offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
