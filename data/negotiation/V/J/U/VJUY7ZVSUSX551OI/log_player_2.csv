"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from what I have in mind.  Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,100,000?  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,075,000 is closer to where we need to be, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,090,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  While we've gotten closer to a compromise, the risk of further negotiation potentially driving the price even higher is too great.  To ensure I stay within my budget, I'll buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
