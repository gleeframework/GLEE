"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,150,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This represents a significant discount for you, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from what I have in mind.  Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,100,000?  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  I'm confident this price would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,075,000 is closer to where we need to be, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,090,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
