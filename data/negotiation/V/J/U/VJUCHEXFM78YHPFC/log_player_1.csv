Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have the security of John's offer, so I'm not desperate and can aim high with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming to secure the best possible outcome."
