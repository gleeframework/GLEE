"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still reflecting the product's true value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It makes more sense for Bob to continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While there's a chance he could negotiate a lower price, the risk of continuing is high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at his set price of $1,200,000, guaranteeing him the best deal within his budget."
