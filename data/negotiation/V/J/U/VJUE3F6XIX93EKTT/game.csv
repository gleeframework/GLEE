"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $14,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $14,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I may have to look at other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise at $15,500, which is still a good discount from my original offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm willing to go to $15,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that, or I'll need to go with another option.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. I'm firm at $15,000 for the package deal.",15000.0,Alice,7,
