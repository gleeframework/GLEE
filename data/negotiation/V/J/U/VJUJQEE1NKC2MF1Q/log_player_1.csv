Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I think $15,000 is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

```
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Selling to John for $12,000 is a sure thing and ensures I don't lose potential profit by continuing to haggle with Bob.
