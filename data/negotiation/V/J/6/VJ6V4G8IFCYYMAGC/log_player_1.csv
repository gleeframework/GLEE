Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers, creating a sense of urgency and potential competition.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially leading to a final price above your minimum. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could test different offers and messages to see how Bob responds."
