"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is cheaper than Alice's initial value, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is quite a bit below what I can realistically accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above my budget.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $80.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without taking a significant loss.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still above my budget, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll be able to reach my target price of $80. John is already offering the product at my desired price, so it's more efficient and less risky to buy from John."
