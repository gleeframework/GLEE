"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
