"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your asking price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can find other interested buyers at this price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is now willing to pay more than John's offer.  It's better to accept the $850,000 than risk him walking away in further rounds."
