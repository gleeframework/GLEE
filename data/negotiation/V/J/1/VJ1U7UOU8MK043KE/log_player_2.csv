Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,200. I think I've already made some significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going below $11,750. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is not going to budge significantly from her $11,750 price point. While the extras are nice, they don't justify the extra cost when I can get the product from John for a guaranteed $15,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
