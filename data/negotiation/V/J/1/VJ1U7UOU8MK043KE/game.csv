"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $11,750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out.  I'm willing to pay $11,100, but that's my final offer. I need to make a decision soon.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you need to make a decision soon, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $11,550. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11550.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little bit closer to my budget.  How about $11,200?  This is my final offer.",11200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,200. I think I've already made some significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going below $11,750. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",11750.0,Alice,9,
