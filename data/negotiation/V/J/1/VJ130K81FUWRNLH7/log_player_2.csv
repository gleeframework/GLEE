"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $15,000, which is your maximum price.  However, you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This doesn't save you any money, but it allows you to explore other options if any become available."
