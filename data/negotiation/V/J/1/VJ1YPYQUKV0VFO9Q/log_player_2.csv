# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

This seems like the best time to accept the offer. Alice is signaling this is her final concession and she's unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
