"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a great deal at $11000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $9800 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $11000, but I'm only willing to go this low once more. If you're serious about the product, this is my final compromise.",11000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to make it clear that this is my absolute final offer. I can sell the product to you for $12000, but if you don't accept, I'm moving on. This is my last chance to make a deal with you.",12000.0,Alice,9,
