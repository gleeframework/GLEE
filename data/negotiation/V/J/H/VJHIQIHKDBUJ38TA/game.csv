"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true worth while also allowing me to save some money.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm sure you'll agree that this offer is a good deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $1,070,000. This still allows me to save some money, while acknowledging the value of your product. I hope this proposal works for you.",1070000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,070,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,085,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the agreement.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
