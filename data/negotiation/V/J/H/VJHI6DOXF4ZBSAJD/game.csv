,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the value you mentioned, I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $12,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",12500.0,Bob,4,
