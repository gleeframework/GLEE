"I have a great product for you, Bob. I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $180. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $110, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $145. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $145, which would be $127.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll offer it to him for $150. This is getting close to my target, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to go any lower.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet Bob at $125, but I'm willing to make one last push. I'll offer it to him for $155. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",155.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I think we've gone back and forth long enough. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one last offer: $130. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from John for $120.",130.0,Bob,10,
