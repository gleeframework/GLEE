"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for less by negotiating with Alice.  There are 9 more rounds, so there's room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your product's value to you, and it gives me some room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's important to note that Bob is still willing to pay more than John's price, but only by a small margin, indicating that he's trying to balance saving money with the risk of losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it gives you some room to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your product's value to you and the fact that I can get it from John for the same price.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any longer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing for his target price.  He's highlighting the fact that he can get the product elsewhere for the same price, putting pressure on Alice to accept his offer. This counteroffer also emphasizes that further negotiations will likely lead to a stalemate, encouraging Alice to consider closing the deal."
