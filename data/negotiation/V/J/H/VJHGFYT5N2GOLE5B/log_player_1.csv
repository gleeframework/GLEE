Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your product's value to you, and it gives me some room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
