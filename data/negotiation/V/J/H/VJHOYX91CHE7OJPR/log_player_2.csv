"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $600,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $650,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can push her closer to my target price of $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $650,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $675,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way up to $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $650,000 and $675,000, which would be $662,500. This is the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $662,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $662,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $662,500 is very close to my target price of $675,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that I might lose the deal altogether. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at $800,000."
