Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? It's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, and I really do think this product would be a great addition to my collection. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. Accepting it will allow me to sell the product without risking too much. The potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal."
