"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Openness:** By mentioning ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Curiosity:**  The message is designed to pique Bob's interest and make him want to learn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's tempting to take the $10,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Since Bob is interested and has already shown willingness to negotiate, there's potential to reach a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a great deal for a product like this. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Finality:**  By suggesting this is a ""great deal,"" I'm subtly hinting that this might be my final concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $11,000? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Time is ticking:** With 6 rounds left, it's getting riskier to continue negotiating.

It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing at all."
