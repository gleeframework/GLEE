"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* Even though you could get a better deal (potentially) by rejecting and negotiating with Alice, the goal is to save money. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a lower price than John's."
