It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially save a lot more than buying from John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and is still within my budget. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."

While $900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to move closer to Alice's price but still maintaining my budget. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. I've saved $90,000 compared to Alice's last offer, which is a decent win."
