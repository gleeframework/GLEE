Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating it's ""close to what I need,"" I imply that I'm open to some negotiation but not too much.
* **Strategic Backup:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a Better Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining position and avoid settling for a price that is too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise here. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a halfway point between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** By mentioning a compromise, I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to nudge Bob closer to my preferred price point while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** While $9,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation is becoming lengthy, and the potential gains from further negotiation are diminishing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit without the risk of further negotiation or rejection. 

It's more beneficial at this point to secure the guaranteed profit of $15,000 from John, rather than continue negotiating with Bob for a lower price."
