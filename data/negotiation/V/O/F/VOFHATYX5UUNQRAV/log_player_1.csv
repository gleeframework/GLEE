Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value, to encourage Bob's interest.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
