"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, knowing that he values it at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to give up on getting a better price, especially since I have more rounds left.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $750,000 is still too low. Let's try $825,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer $787,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired price, but still within a reasonable range for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $787,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I hope we can close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 800000}
