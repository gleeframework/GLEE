"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a maximum budget of $15,000, accepting the offer at $12,000 is a good start. However, there's always a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she needs to sell the product quickly. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 20% lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiation and am willing to push for a better deal.  While this might seem aggressive, it leaves room for compromise during the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price.  There's potential to negotiate further, and I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting this offer to see if I can get a better price.  I'll continue to keep the $15,000 option from John in mind as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's latest offer.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  While I might be able to push for a lower price, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a significantly better deal. Accepting the offer now guarantees I get the product for a good price within my budget."
