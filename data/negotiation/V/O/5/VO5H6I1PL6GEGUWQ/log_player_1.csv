"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After reviewing its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price, such as emphasizing the product's value and potential return on investment, makes the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value, you leave ample space for negotiation and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even his own perceived value ($1,200,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's highly likely a better deal can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** This counter-offer represents a significant decrease from your initial asking price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. However, it's not a drastic drop, demonstrating you're still seeking a strong price reflecting the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point remains comfortably above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's stated value ($1,200,000), providing room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob to justify his valuation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  By reiterating the ""product's true potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of the benefits and incentivize him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his perceived value of the product, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have room to negotiate and should aim to close the gap further. You're closer to your minimum, but selling to John guarantees that price point. Holding out for a bit longer to see if Bob will increase his offer is strategically sound."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the very lowest I can go for this product. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations in terms of value."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer establishes your firm bottom line while maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone. 
* **Transparency Builds Trust:**  By being transparent about your minimum acceptable price, you foster trust with Bob and demonstrate that you're negotiating in good faith.
* **Final Push:** This offer encourages Bob to make his final decision, as he knows you won't go any lower. It's a clear signal that he either needs to accept this price or risk losing the deal."
