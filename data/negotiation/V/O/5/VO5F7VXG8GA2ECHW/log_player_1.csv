Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob might not accept this price, and I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000, which gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my starting price and also lower than John's offer.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more if I reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial price.
* **Not Giving Up on Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $800,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Signaling Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to come back with a higher offer.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** By keeping the price above $1,000,000, I ensure that I'm still getting a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, it's still below my initial price and only slightly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, there's a risk of a stalemate, where neither of us is willing to budge. This could lead to a protracted negotiation, potentially hurting my chances of selling the product at a decent price.
* **Secure a Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is a good outcome considering the negotiation's progress.  It's a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my expectations."
