``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it still gives me a profit margin. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there.  If his counteroffer is too low, I'll have the option of either making a counteroffer or selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for you to make a good profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's the best offer I've received so far.  It's also the same price John is offering, so I'm happy to accept and finalize the deal."
