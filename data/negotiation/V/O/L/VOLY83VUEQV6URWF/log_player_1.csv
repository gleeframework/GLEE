Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  If he rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum."
