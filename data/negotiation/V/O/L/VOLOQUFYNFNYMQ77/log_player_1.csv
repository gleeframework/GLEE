Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $11,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $10,500) while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  The worst-case scenario is Bob rejects the offer, and Alice sells to John for $8,000. This offer aims to secure a much higher return."
