"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let's see if we can make a deal!

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,100,000 doesn't cover my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's try $1,150,000 - it's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefit it will bring you. This is my final offer - let's get this done!
