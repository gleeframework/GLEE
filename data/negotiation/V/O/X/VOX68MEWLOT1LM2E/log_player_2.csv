The product is worth $80 to Bob. Alice's offer is $110, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.  It makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price."

While Alice's offer is better than before, it is still above Bob's preferred price point.  Bob can try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Alice's offer is $93. This is still more than Bob's maximum price of $80.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product for $80 from John, it makes sense to take that option."
