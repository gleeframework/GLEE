"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000.  I believe it holds significant value that may benefit you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget of $8,000. It's not even close to his maximum willingness to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. Would you consider $10,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $8,000. While she has lowered the price, it's still not within Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. It's still worth attempting to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $12,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe this price could be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the price needs to reflect the true value of this product.  I could consider $15,000, my absolute lowest price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $8,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower. Bob has already made a significant counteroffer and reached a point where continuing the negotiation might not be worth the effort. Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most sensible choice at this point."
