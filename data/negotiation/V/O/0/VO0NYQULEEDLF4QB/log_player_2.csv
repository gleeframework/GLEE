"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth it. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
