Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price.

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While tempting, it's generally not a good negotiation tactic to start at the absolute highest price. It leaves no room for movement and might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of, potentially leading to him rejecting the offer outright."
