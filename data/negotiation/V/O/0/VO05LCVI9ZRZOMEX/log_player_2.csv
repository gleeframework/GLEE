"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $135. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer in the first round. You can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are very close to your target price of $120. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if you can get Alice down to that price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $128? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $128 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $129?  This is the final price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $129 is close to your goal, it's still over your personal limit.  It's better to stick to your budget and buy from John for the guaranteed $120."
