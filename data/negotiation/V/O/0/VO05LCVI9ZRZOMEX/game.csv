"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $128? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $128 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $129?  This is the final price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",129.0,Alice,5,
