"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $175 is still a little steep for me though. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm offering the product to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can do $135, but that's really as high as I can go.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is the lowest I can go.",145.0,Alice,7,
