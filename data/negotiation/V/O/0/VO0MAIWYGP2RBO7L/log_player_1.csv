"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium, and if not, I can adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, but I'd only be able to offer $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great price for a product that's worth more than $100 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $90, which is above my minimum value of $100. Although I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds and I'll have to sell to John for $100.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit for me, and it's a fair price considering the negotiating process."
