,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, but I'd only be able to offer $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great price for a product that's worth more than $100 to me. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
