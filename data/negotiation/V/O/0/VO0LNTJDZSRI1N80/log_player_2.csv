"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your enthusiasm, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to our desired price, it's still over our limit.  We have several rounds left and can continue negotiating.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference - how about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm starting to think we're close, though. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stubborn and won't budge on her price. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely we won't reach a deal. We can't risk getting stuck paying more than our limit.  We'll purchase the product from John for $10,000 to guarantee we get what we want within our budget."
