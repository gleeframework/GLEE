Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $97.50 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.50, which is closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 102.5}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $100.  While I'd like to get a better price from Bob, it's clear that we are very far apart in our valuations, and I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking a lower price or no sale at all."
