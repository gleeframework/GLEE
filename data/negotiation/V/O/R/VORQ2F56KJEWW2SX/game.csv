"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at over a million dollars to me. I believe it has the potential to be just as valuable to you.  Let's start with a price of $1500000. This allows room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This price still allows for a good margin for me, but also demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1150000, which I believe is fair considering my budget constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your continued interest in the product.  While $1150000 is closer to my desired price,  I need to make sure this deal makes sense for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1200000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
