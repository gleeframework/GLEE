{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at over a million dollars to me. I believe it has the potential to be just as valuable to you.  Let's start with a price of $1,500,000. This allows room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my floor price, I'm confident I can do better than that with Bob.  There are 8 rounds left, and I want to explore if we can reach a higher price. Selling to John now would mean leaving money on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still allows for a good margin for me, but also demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1150000, which I believe is fair considering my budget constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $1,150,000, which is getting closer to my desired price. However, I still believe there is room for negotiation. With six rounds remaining, I want to see if I can push him a bit further towards my target price.  Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your continued interest in the product.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price,  I need to make sure this deal makes sense for me.

I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
