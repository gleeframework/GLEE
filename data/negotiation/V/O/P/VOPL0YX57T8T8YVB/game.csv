"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product to your operations is much higher. I could be persuaded to agree on a price of $1,200,000.  This offer represents a fair balance between value and investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
