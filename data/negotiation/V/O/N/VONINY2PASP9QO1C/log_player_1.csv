Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing it's above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and increase the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer by asking what he thinks. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm ready to sell to John for $100 if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I'm unwilling to sell below my minimum of $100. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Counteroffer:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the interest! While I appreciate your offer, $100 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying ""I'm looking for.""
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's feedback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I still can't afford more than $100 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Negotiation:** Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to go above $100. 
* **Minimum Value:** I'm unwilling to sell below my minimum of $100.
* **No Benefit to Further Negotiation:**  Since Bob is firm at his price, I'm better off selling to John at $100 to avoid wasting time on further negotiations."
