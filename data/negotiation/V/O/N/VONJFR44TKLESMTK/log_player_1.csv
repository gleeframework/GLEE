Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd ideally like, it's closer to my minimum price and allows for a quicker sale.  It's not worth risking further negotiations and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
