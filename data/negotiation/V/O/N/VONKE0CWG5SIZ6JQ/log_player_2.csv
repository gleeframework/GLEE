"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair, given its worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than the $1,200,000 from John, it's still too high. Bob should reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still too high.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm offering $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  Let's aim for a quick resolution."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,087,500. This compromise should be fair to both of us.  Let's work towards a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer:** Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer. 
* **The price is within Bob's budget:** While Bob still wants to save as much as possible, $1,087,500 is within his maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's a risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice rejecting future offers or walking away entirely.  It's getting late in the negotiation process.

By accepting this offer, Bob secures the product and saves $112,500 compared to buying from John."
