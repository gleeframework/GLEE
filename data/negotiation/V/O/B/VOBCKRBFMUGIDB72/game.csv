"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for a product you value at $100, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
