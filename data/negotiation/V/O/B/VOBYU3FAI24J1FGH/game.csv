"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's try to finalize the deal here.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $12,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12750.0,Alice,5,
