"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
