"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still within a range that Bob might consider, given his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high price to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob immediately.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about acquiring the product and if he's willing to budge on his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant value for you.  This price allows me to cover my costs and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, highlighting that even at $1,050,000, the product is a worthwhile investment.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for more negotiation by saying ""Let me know if this works for you,"" suggesting that I'm willing to discuss further if necessary.

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,050,000, I'm testing the waters. This price is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. If Bob accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if a mutually agreeable price isn't reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget of $800,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground that would work for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter-offer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about acquiring the product and if he's willing to budge on his initial offer. I'm also aware that John is a reliable alternative if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant value he'll receive from the product, reinforcing the rationale for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I'm emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario, suggesting that this price is beneficial for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to negotiate, aiming to find a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable alternative if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway, Alice. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we consider $925,000 as a compromise? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining a valuable product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints and I'm trying to be flexible.  Let's split the difference on our last offers. How about $937,500?

```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($925,000). This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" for both of us, emphasizing that it's a reasonable solution that allows both parties to benefit.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question (""What do you think?"") to encourage Bob to respond and potentially engage in further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to move towards Bob's price range, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. With only three rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close a deal. If Bob accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the next round: accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I believe we're getting closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Considering your last proposal, I would like to suggest $930,000 as a compromise. This price still aligns closely with my budget while allowing you to cover your costs.

**Strategy:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that this will convince Bob to close the deal. However, I'm also aware that selling to John is a viable option if this final attempt fails."

**Strategy:**

I've reached the final round, and the risk of not closing a deal with Bob outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher price. Selling to John ensures I get a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
