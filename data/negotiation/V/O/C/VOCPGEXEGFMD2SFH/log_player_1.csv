This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum target and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for the same price."
