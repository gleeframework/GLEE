"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
