"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120, but Alice's initial offer of $110 is still too high. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a better price can be negotiated before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still below Bob's maximum price of $120, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high for Bob. Although it's closer to his target price, he should continue to negotiate. Bob can likely get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left, giving him ample time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. He's willing to move a bit higher than his previous offer of $105, demonstrating flexibility, but still remaining below Alice's current offer. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that both parties might be comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but he's getting closer.  Bob has several rounds left to negotiate and shouldn't accept a deal that's too close to his maximum price yet.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can potentially push Alice lower and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet Alice halfway,  offering $110. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's also pushing for a price that's closer to his preferred range.  It's a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob still prefers a lower price, Alice has only offered $113, which is very close to Bob's maximum price of $120.  There are only three rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, it's highly likely that Alice will either reject his counteroffer or offer a price higher than $113 in the final rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves some money compared to buying from John."
