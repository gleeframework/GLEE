Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your minimum ($15,000) might encourage him to counter-offer, leading to a potentially better deal for you.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interest (""interest I've received"") subtly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to your ideal while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider."
