"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and respectful** to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Show continued interest** in the product.
* **Anchor a low price** ($600,000) to start moving the negotiation closer to my desired range.

While this initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved closer to my range, $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledging progress:**  I start by acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate, building goodwill.
* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but by a significant amount ($100,000) to demonstrate seriousness.
* **Justification:** I'm still framing the offer as a ""stretch"" to reinforce my budget limitations.
* **Targeting the midpoint:** $700,000 lands roughly in the middle between the current offer and my desired price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Alice seems firm on staying above $900,000, and while I might be able to negotiate a tiny bit more, it's unlikely to be enough to make it worthwhile.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option now to ensure I stay within my budget."
