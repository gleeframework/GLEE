"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13000 is a bit high for me.  How about $11500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $12500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12500 is closer, it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  How about $12000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle of $12000 and $13000? I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500.",12500.0,Alice,5,
