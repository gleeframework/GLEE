"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a fair price given my budget and the potential value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
