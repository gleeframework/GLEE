"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Consider this my best offer:  $1,000,000. Let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to establish the price at her own valuation, which is also your maximum. While her message hints at urgency, you have a guaranteed backup option with John at the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from her at a lower price, allowing you to potentially save money."
