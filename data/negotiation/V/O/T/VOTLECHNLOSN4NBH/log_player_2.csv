# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. It's time to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?"",

}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  While $9,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price you might accept, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $9,500.  Would you be open to $9,300?"",

}
```

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate towards a middle ground while still pushing for a lower price. By giving a specific number, you're aiming for a more concrete response from Alice."
