Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and the value of the product seems promising. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to $800000? I believe this might be a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
