"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make sure I get a fair deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000 even? It's a clean number and a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on that price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
