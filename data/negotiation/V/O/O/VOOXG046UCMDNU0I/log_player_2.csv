Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make sure I get a fair deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000 even? It's a clean number and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on that price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  While we could try to haggle further, we risk her sticking to this price or even walking away. Accepting now secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of getting stuck with John's higher price."
