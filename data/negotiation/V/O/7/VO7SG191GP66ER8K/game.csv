"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet with $11000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11500?  It's a fair price that's closer to your offer but also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm starting to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
