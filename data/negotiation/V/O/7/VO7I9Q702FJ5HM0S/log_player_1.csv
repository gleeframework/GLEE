Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just ""value and potential"") can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" encourage a dialogue and make Bob feel like he has a say in the process. 

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then negotiate down towards her minimum of $12,000, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
