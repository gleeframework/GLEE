Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something you'll truly value. I'm confident it's worth $1,450,000 to you, considering the potential benefits.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit above my budget.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. Selling to John right now would be a loss compared to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits and value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
