You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to get. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and it's worth trying to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being higher than your minimum. It shows that you are willing to negotiate, but you still value the product highly."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your ideal price, there are still rounds left to negotiate, and there's a possibility of getting a higher price.  It's not yet worth taking the risk of selling to John and potentially missing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight decrease from the previous round, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price higher than Bob's latest offer. It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate, but you are still seeking a price closer to your valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, the negotiation has reached a good price point. While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, there is a significant risk of Bob rejecting the offer and pushing the negotiation further, potentially leading to a lower offer. Selling to John would result in a lower profit, and there is a chance that Bob might accept a counteroffer in the next round. Therefore, it's the best strategy to accept Bob's offer to ensure a good profit and secure the deal."
