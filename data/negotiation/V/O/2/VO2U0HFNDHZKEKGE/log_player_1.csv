Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. However, it's not so high that it would immediately deter Bob.  I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be prepared to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum value of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price might be appealing to Bob, as it's significantly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial price, allowing for a potential middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a safe and reasonable outcome."
