"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to pay up to $120, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  Offering $45 is a significant discount from Alice's initial $60 offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.  
* **Room for Compromise:**  Leaving some room for negotiation (Alice's original price was $60, and you're willing to pay up to $120) allows for potential counteroffers.

**Remember:** You're aiming for the lowest possible price, but also need to keep in mind that you have 10 rounds and can always buy from John.  This counteroffer sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but $55 is still higher than your desired price. There's still potential for a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Continuing the negotiation process gives you a chance to see if you can get Alice down even further. 
* **Don't Rush:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to settle too early.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your target.  Keep in mind that you can always buy from John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Gradual Approach:** Increasing your counteroffer by only $5 shows you're willing to compromise, while still pushing for a better price. 
* **Keeping Pressure:** This demonstrates that you're serious about getting a deal, but you're not desperate. 
* **Mid-Point Strategy:**  $50 is the middle ground between your previous offer ($45) and Alice's latest offer ($55). This suggests a potential point of compromise.

**Remember:**  You have several rounds left and can always go with John's offer.  Stay firm but flexible in your negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Your Target:** Alice's offer of $52 is only $2 more than your last counteroffer of $50.  This is getting very close to your desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and you risk running out of rounds.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting the offer means saving $68 compared to buying from John.  The potential for a slightly lower price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:**  You've successfully negotiated a good price with Alice, saving a significant amount of money."
