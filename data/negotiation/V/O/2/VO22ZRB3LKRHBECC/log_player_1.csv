Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counters.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth, mentioning ""its value"" hints at its significance and justifies a price higher than $12,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's input, making it clear that you're open to discussing the price further.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer. However, starting too low might make him undervalue the product.
* **Market Demand:** If you know the product is in high demand, you can afford to be more assertive with your pricing."
