{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts by being polite and building a rapport with Bob. It also emphasizes the value of the product while leaving some room for negotiation.  The price is above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum, leaving space for a potential counteroffer. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while ensuring the possibility of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
