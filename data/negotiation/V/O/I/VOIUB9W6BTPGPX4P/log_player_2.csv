Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250.

It's getting late in the negotiation and Alice has consistently been coming down. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, the difference is getting smaller and there's a risk Alice won't budge further. Accepting at $11,250 secures a good discount."
