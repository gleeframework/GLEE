"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,000. I'll offer it to you for $12,250. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm afraid $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering its value and the fact that I could buy it elsewhere for $15,000. Let me know if this works for you.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,125. This is a very reasonable offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this.",11125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",11250.0,Alice,9,
