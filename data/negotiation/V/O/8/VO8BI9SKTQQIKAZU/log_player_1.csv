"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation but still aim high. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""given its potential value"") makes the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My tone is friendly and suggests I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to spend a significant amount. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's offer and using phrases like ""working with me"" maintains a positive and cooperative atmosphere.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Clear Target:** Offering a specific number ($1,250,000) gives Bob a concrete figure to consider and potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $1,150,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating down in smaller increments, indicating he's getting closer to his limit.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a significant difference from my target. I'll push back one more time to test his resolve before considering accepting or moving to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,200,000 even? This would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Progress:** Phrases like ""sensing we're getting close"" and ""win-win"" create a sense of momentum and encourage a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):**  Since my previous middle-ground offer was rejected, I'm returning to his last offer of $1,200,000 but framing it as a final compromise.
* **Simplified Number:** A clean $1,200,000 might seem more appealing than dealing with smaller increments at this stage."
