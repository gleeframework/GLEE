Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range.  While I would prefer a lower price, I'm willing to accept this offer as it's significantly lower than John's price and a good deal for me.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
