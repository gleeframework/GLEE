"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to let the product go for $9,000.  That way we both get something out of this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but I'm still only able to pay $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's more than what I would pay John. Let's finalize this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to get something out of this deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little low for me.  How about we compromise at $9,250? That's halfway between our last offers and a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",9250.0,Alice,7,
