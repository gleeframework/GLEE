"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to compromise at $85. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to accept $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80, which would be $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $82.50.  You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price."
