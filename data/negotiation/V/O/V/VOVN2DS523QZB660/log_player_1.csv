Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your ""walk-away"" price. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Therefore, any offer you make to Bob should be higher than this to make it worth your while.  However, you also want to offer a price attractive enough that Bob might accept.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a highly competitive price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents excellent value considering its potential. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Negotiable:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring you make a profit if Bob accepts. It's also within a range Bob might find appealing, as it's $150,000 less than his perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes ""competitive price"" and ""excellent value"" to make the offer more enticing to Bob. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message ends with a clear request for Bob's decision.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a tough negotiator, he might try to push for a lower price. Be prepared to potentially negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
