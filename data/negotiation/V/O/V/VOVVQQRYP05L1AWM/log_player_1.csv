"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit while also leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a risk, but the potential reward is worth it. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  There's still a good chance of getting a better deal with Bob, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This should keep the negotiation moving while still allowing for a decent profit.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to consider whether it's worth risking further rounds or just selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There are 6 rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept while still getting a good price.  We're approaching the middle of the negotiations, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal, but I also want to avoid jeopardizing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum, so I'm not going to risk further rounds of negotiation.  I can sell to John and get a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum requirement.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a safe and reasonable choice."
