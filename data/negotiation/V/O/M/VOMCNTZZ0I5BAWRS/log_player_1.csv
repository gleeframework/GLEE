"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $90. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. It's still a good profit for me while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while ensuring a quick sale. Selling to John for $80 would be less profitable."
