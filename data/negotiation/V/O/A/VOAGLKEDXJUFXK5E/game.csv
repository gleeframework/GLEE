"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $7,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be agreeable to you?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not going to go any lower than $6,800. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",6800.0,Alice,5,
