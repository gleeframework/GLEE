"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's, there is room for negotiation to potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's, and closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  He should continue trying to lower the price."
