You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $11,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still quite low for what it's worth. How about we settle at $9,500?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,500. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
