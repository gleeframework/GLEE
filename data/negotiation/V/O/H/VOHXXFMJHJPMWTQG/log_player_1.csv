"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer leaves space for potential counteroffers while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to consider a price within the range of $750,000 to $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is within a reasonable range, accepting it would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and we have ample room to negotiate before reaching our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

It's time to counter and try to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $775,000 is a significant departure from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While we rejected Bob's offer, we're showing flexibility by decreasing our price by $50,000. This signals willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message reinforces the product's high value, subtly nudging Bob back towards his higher perceived worth.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** Our counteroffer is designed to encourage Bob to meet us closer to the middle of the remaining negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that $800,000 would be a more reasonable price for both parties. I hope this aligns closer to your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our absolute minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures we get a good deal ($800,000) and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
