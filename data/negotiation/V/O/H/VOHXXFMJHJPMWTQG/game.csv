"I understand your position, Bob, but $775,000 is a significant departure from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a considerable return on your investment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
