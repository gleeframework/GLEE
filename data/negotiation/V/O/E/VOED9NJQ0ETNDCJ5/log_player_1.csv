Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value and also higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to be more assertive in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I still have the option of selling to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried that we'll get stuck in a cycle of ever-decreasing offers. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
