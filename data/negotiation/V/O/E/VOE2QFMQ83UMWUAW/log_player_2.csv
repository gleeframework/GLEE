"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price point of $150, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, $110 is still a good deal for me and saves me money compared to buying from John. There's always a chance she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be stuck with John's price, so accepting here minimizes risk."
