Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to part with the product for $800,000 (its value to you).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is also worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 if Bob declines.

**The Strategy**

The key here is to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept, knowing you have a backup offer.  Since the value is the same for both of you, a small markup is the most logical approach.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $825,000 is fair. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is polite, direct, and positions the price as fair due to the inherent value of the product.
* **Price:** The $25,000 markup is significant but not exorbitant. It allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still earning you a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject any offer above $800,000. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain while still having a high probability of a successful sale."
