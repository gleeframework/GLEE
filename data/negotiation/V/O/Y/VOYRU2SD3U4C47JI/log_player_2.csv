It's still worth negotiating further as Alice is willing to go down to $155, and you are still willing to pay up to $150.  You can try a counteroffer in the next round."

While you can keep negotiating, Alice's offer is close to your maximum, and there's a risk she might not budge further. It's safer to accept and avoid the chance of losing the deal altogether."
