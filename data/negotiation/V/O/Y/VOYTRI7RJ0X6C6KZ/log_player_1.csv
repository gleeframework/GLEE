Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product certainly seems valuable, I'm looking to secure it at a more competitive price. I'd be happy to consider a price of $750,000, which still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to secure the product at a competitive price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit margin I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which would allow you to break even while still securing a deal. I believe this price represents a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
