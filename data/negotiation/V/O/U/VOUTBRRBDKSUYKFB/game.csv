"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth a maximum of $800,000 to me,  so I'd be willing to offer you $500,000.  I think that's a fair starting point considering the gap between our valuations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand there's a gap between our valuations.  While $500,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move a bit.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $650,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial valuation.  Let's try $800,000.  This offer reflects the significant value this product holds.",800000.0,Alice,5,
