"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product,  and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'm offering the product to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than $90.  If you're willing to accept that,  we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $92.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.",92.5,Alice,7,
