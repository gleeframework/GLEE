"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $120. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is a better offer than Alice's initial $120, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product,  and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'm offering the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than $90.  If you're willing to accept that,  we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $92.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $92.5 is a good offer, it's still over Bob's limit.  Given that Alice has indicated she won't go lower, it's best to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
