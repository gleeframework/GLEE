"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him. There's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value of $150, but also acknowledging the product's value to Alice. A $130 offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some room for compromise while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a reasonable compromise. It's still within Bob's budget and only $15 more than what the product is worth to Alice. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether or ending up with John's higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with, and saves time and potential frustration."
