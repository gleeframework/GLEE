"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the potential. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,850,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward if you're agreeable.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
