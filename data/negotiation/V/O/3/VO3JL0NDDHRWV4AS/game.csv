"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This accounts for its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a deal.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
