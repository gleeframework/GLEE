"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? ",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,000,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the value of this product worth the investment.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
