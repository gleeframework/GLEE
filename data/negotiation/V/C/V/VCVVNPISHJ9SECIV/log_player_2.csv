"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $12000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $10000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for you, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($12,000).  This means you save $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better price, and you risk losing the product altogether."
