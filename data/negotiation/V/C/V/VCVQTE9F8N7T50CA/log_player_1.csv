{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at a point where it is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm still leaving myself room to come down a bit if needed.

I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage a positive start to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a win."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
