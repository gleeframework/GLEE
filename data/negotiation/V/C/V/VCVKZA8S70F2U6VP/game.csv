"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,100,000 to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to me.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
