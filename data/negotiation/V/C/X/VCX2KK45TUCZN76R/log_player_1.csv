"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds remaining and I'm confident I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 6 rounds remaining and am confident I can get closer to my target price. I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and your budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise and represents a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6, and Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not getting a better offer and losing valuable time is increasing. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure the deal."
