"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. Let's meet halfway on this.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise and still within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and your budget.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise and represents a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
