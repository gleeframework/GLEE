Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, which would be $1000000. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is the same as her original offer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk going to John and paying $1,200,000. It's time to accept and move on."
