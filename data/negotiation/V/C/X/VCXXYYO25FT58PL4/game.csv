"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  Let's work towards a final deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, which would be $1000000. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
