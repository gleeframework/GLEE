Considering its worth to both parties, we propose a fair price of $11,000 for this exceptional product. We're confident that this offer strikes a balance between our interests and provides you with an opportunity to acquire something truly special. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer ($11,000) is higher than her product valuation ($10,000), it's still less than your maximum price ($12,000) and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
