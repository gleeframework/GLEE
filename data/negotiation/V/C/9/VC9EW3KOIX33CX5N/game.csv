"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
