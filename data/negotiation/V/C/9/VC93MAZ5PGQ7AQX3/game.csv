,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Can you meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's close the deal!",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen!",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, Alice, but $8,700 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,400, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8400.0,Bob,8,
