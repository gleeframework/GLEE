"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth. I understand its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's both fair and beneficial for both of us.  Consider this a unique opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a price that's hard to beat.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. While she acknowledges the product's value to you, her offer doesn't reflect a willingness to negotiate within your acceptable range. Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
