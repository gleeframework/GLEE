"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been designed with exceptional quality and functionality. Given its value to us, I understand it might be a significant investment. However, considering its worth to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $12,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and the cost to us, while also providing you with a substantial discount compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to serve you with our high-quality product.
