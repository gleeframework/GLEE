"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer, but $22,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and gives you a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the most logical choice at this point."
