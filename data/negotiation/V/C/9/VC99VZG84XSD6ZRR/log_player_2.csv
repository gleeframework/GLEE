"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $85 is a good price, but there's potential to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. I believe this is still a fair price for the product, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$80 is a fair price, and it's closer to my ideal price point than John's offer. There's no guarantee I can get it lower, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds."
