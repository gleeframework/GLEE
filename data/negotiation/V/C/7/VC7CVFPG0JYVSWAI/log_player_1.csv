Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($10,000) to maximize your potential earnings.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down if he wishes, while still keeping you comfortably above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay a premium. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher price."
