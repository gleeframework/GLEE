"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. Even if she doesn't, you're still willing to pay John's price."
