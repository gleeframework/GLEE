"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
