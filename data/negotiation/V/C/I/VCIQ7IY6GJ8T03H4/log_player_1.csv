"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $85 for your product. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
