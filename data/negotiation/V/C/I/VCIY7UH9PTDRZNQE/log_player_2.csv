"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her than her asking price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A low counteroffer will help me understand how eager Alice is to sell and how low she might be willing to go.
* **Work towards a favorable price:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets the stage for negotiation towards a price closer to my desired range. 

By starting low, I increase my chances of securing a better deal than simply accepting Alice's initial offer or immediately going with John's backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice reducing her price shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still more than John's offer. There's a small margin for negotiation left, and I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer to see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm aiming to keep this purchase closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm splitting the difference between her lowered price ($12,500) and my previous offer ($10,500). This keeps the negotiation moving while signaling that I'm serious about the purchase but still aiming for a lower price point.  It's a balance between trying to get the best deal and not risking her walking away to leave me with John's less appealing offer."
