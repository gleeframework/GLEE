Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob is likely to counteroffer.
* This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the likelihood of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired value.**  Selling for $10,500 would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain a stronger negotiating position.**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially driving a better deal.
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  If the negotiation fails, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to my value:**  $12,500 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value is $12,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to lose too much.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth of the price I'm offering. 

**Strategy:**

* **This counteroffer is a compromise.** It demonstrates my willingness to find common ground, while still protecting my interests. 
* **If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept his counteroffer if it's close to $12,000.** 
* **However, I will be ready to sell to John if Bob's counteroffer is too low.**  I am determined to get a price that is fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm aiming to keep this purchase closer to $11,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my perceived value ($12,000).**  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's within a reasonable range.
* **Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially missing out on John's offer.**  If I reject Bob's offer and then counter, there's no guarantee he will accept my counteroffer. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a relatively good price.**  I can use the money from this sale to explore other opportunities or invest in new products.

**Strategy:**

* **I'm prioritizing a quick and secure sale.** This is a good outcome, considering Bob's initial counteroffer was significantly lower than my starting point.
* **This decision reflects a calculated risk assessment.** While I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
