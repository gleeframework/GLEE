Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still quite a bit above my budget. I could potentially stretch to $750,000.  Do you think we could make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball. We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate without settling for less than our guaranteed amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
