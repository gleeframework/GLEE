"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $165?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $130. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at $130, and further negotiation is unlikely to net a significantly better outcome. Taking the guaranteed $150 from John is the most profitable decision."
