"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $950,000 is a bit above my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, considering its uniqueness.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening counteroffer:** By offering $850,000, I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* **Highlighting value and budget:** I acknowledge the product's uniqueness but also emphasize my budget constraints.
* **Focus on finding common ground:** The message concludes with a positive tone, expressing my willingness to negotiate and find a fair solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is a reasonable compromise from her previous offer of $950,000 and my counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **Saving Money:**  This price is significantly lower than what John is offering, allowing me to save $125,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'm already three rounds in, and I want to avoid potentially losing time with further negotiations.

While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away increases with each round. Accepting this offer seems like the most sensible choice to secure the product while achieving a good price."
