"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",87.5,Bob,6,
