{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm holding out for a better price. I know the product is worth more to him, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  There's still a gap between what he's offering and what I'm willing to accept. I'm not desperate to sell and I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great price for a product worth $120 to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $87.50 is a good compromise, and it's more than what John would pay."
