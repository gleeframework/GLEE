"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,900,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll be receiving."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, $1,500,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now revealed that his absolute maximum is $1,500,000. While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is still below what I consider a fair price.  How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects my effort in finding a compromise while acknowledging the value you see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting tough! I appreciate your movement on the price, but I need you to understand that $1,500,000 is the very most I can justify spending.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reiterated his absolute maximum price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a higher price at this point. Accepting his offer secures the sale at a price equal to what John is offering, preventing further risk of losing out on the sale."
