"Alice, your initial offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price reflects my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my original asking price reflects the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
