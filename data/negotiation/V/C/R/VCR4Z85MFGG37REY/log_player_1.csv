"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my opening offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely he'll accept immediately. It gives me room to negotiate downwards while still securing a profit above my minimum.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to settle for such a low price this early in the process. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000, which is still above my minimum price and closer to what I believe is fair.  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while also making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering a price that's too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my counteroffer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  $1,100,000 is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate further.  I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to raise his offer and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000, so I'll counteroffer again.  I'm aware that I have only four rounds remaining, but I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

With only four rounds left, I need to be more aggressive. This counteroffer is a significant drop, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will make Bob realize that he needs to get closer to my desired price if he wants to close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of ending up with nothing is getting higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'm running out of time.  To avoid the risk of ending up with nothing, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This is a guaranteed profit, and it's the best option at this point."
