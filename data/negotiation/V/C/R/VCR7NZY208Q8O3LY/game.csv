"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
