,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering how much you value the product. Let's make this deal work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 simply doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm firm on $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make. If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept this offer.",9750.0,Alice,7,
