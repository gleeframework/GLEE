Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has some room to bargain if he feels the price is too high.
* **It's appealing to Bob:**  He knows the product is worth more to him, so he might be willing to pay a bit more to get it.

If Bob rejects, you can then consider his counteroffer and adjust your strategy based on his response."
