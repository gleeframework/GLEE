"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we start the conversation at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I could consider a price of $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  While $750,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $850,000 to close this deal quickly.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the final offer, and I understand you have other potential buyers.  To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I wish you the best with the other interested parties.",800000.0,Bob,6,
