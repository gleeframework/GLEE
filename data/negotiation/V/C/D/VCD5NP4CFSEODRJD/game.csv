"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.  Given its unique benefits, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I can come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but  $1,225,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation. My final offer is $1,300,000. This leaves us both with a satisfactory outcome.  ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty about having another interested buyer. However, I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
