Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.  Therefore, starting with a higher offer makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $20,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down in price, potentially settling somewhere above our minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:**  Presenting the offer with confidence and highlighting the product's value can influence Bob's perception, even if he doesn't ultimately pay the initial asking price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher sale price outweighs the risk in this scenario, given our guaranteed minimum from John."
