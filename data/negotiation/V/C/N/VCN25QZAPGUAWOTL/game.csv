"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is way below what I need to sell. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That gives us both a fair price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $95? That's a solid offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is just not workable for me. Let's try $110.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,6,
