"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that works for both parties. He's offering $105, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's acceptable range. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $108 for the product. This is our best offer based on current market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $108 is lower than Bob's maximum of $120.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject the counteroffer. This could lead to a deadlock or force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** With 10 rounds total, it's better to secure the product now and avoid the possibility of losing it to another buyer.

**In conclusion**, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move, ensuring Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
