Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be open to considering that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
