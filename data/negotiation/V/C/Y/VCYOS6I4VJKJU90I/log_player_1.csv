**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly stuck at a price point significantly lower than your minimum.  It's unlikely he will budge much beyond $950,000.  Rather than continue haggling and potentially settling for even less, it's more profitable to cut your losses and sell to John for your guaranteed price."
