"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget you're working with, but I need to be firm on this.  The absolute lowest I can go is $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
