"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $10,500 is still above the product's value to her, and Bob wants to get the best deal possible. He should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to go any lower than $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $10,000. While this is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already demonstrated his willingness to pay close to $10,000, but he wants to see if he can secure a price closer to $9,500.  It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation before potentially going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it lets us both get a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to go any lower than $10,500, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at $10,500, I'm happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her previous offer of $10,500. This price is still above Bob's desired price point, and it seems like she is unwilling to negotiate further.  With only a few rounds left, Bob should consider buying from John.  While it's not the best price, it's within his budget and saves time and potential frustration in further negotiations with Alice."
