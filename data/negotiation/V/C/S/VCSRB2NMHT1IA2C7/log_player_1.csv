Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I'll try to negotiate with him before resorting to selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm still hoping to get a higher price. While $1,062,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,062,500 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000 as a final compromise.

Round 8

We've reached the end of the negotiation and are still far from my desired price.  While $1,055,000 is not terrible, I'm better off selling to John and securing my minimum value of $1,200,000."
