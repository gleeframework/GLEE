"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair deal. I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I'm not budging from there. Can we meet at $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,062,500 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000 as a final compromise. This price acknowledges your value proposition while also reflecting the product's worth to me.  Let's make this deal happen!",1070000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,070,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,055,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer.",1055000.0,Bob,8,
