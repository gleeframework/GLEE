Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is far too low for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we compromise at $1,050,000? That's still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price.  I'm not ready to sell at that price yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. That's still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
