"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring counteroffers before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still above my budget.  I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my target price. There's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're showing flexibility.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to get a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe we can both be satisfied with this outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  While it's closer, I want to see if I can push for a lower price. I'm not at the point of buying from John yet, but if Alice doesn't budge much in the next round, I'll need to seriously consider that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,050,000, it's still above my target budget of $800,000. Given the limited rounds remaining (only 3), I don't believe there's enough time to negotiate further and get a better price from Alice.  I'm comfortable with John's offer of $800,000, and I'll avoid risking losing out on the product altogether."
