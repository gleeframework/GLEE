Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for your product. It's a fair price, considering my needs and the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, I am confident I can get closer to my target price. I will counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal of $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant improvement over his previous offer and allows me to avoid the potential risks of further negotiation."
