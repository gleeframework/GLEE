"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  By rejecting, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since she's already rejected a counteroffer."
