"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price makes sense. 
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, fostering a good negotiating environment.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our maximum budget and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:**  Alice is coming down, but not by much. This suggests she might have some flexibility. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** We're still significantly below our $12,000 walk-away point and John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better price and encourage Alice to move closer to our range."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 10800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($10,500) and her current offer ($11,200). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise and potentially speed up the process. 
* **Justification:**  By framing the offer as a ""fair price that reflects the value,"" we're subtly reminding Alice of our position and desired outcome.
* **Strategic Timing:** We're still in the early-to-mid rounds of negotiation, so there's time for a few more back-and-forths if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Alice has stated this is her lowest price, indicating a firm stance.
* **Minimal Savings Potential:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are getting smaller. The difference between her current offer ($11,000) and our target ($10,800) is only $200.
* **Time and Risk:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing carries the risk that Alice won't budge further, and we'll end up having to buy from John at $12,000 anyway.

**It's better to secure a good deal now ($11,000) than risk losing it for a potentially insignificant gain.**"
