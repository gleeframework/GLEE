Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not taking an unreasonable risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Plan B:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a backup with John who will pay $1,200,000, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I can accept right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my target price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,100,000 is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a logical compromise point.
* **Still Profitable:**  This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your target and me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Plan B:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,200,000, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob comes up in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm still offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but not compromising my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,125,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,075,000. This makes it a reasonable and logical point for both of us.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** I'm still earning a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This ensures that even if Bob rejects my counteroffer, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
