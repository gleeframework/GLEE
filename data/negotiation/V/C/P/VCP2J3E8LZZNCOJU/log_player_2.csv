# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  You can aim to get closer to your $1,000,000 target price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $1050000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I can accept right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my target price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still closer to your target price of $1,000,000. You know Alice is willing to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to counter-offer.  There's still room to potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your target and me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1075000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1125000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the negotiation is getting close to your target price of $1,000,000. However, Alice is still quite a bit above that. It's likely that you'll continue to go back and forth without a definitive agreement.  Given the risk of getting stuck in a long negotiation with no guarantee of a price you're happy with, it's more advantageous to buy from John at this time.  You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 with certainty, saving you time and potential frustration."
