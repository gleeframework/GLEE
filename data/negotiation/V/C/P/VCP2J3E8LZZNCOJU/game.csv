"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $1050000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I can accept right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my target price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your target and me to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1075000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1125000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, so let me know your thoughts.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
