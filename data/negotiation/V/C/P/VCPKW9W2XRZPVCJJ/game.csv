"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?  I'm really keen on getting this product, but that's my absolute maximum.",12000.0,Bob,4,
