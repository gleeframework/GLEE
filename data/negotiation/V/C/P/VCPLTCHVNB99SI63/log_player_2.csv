"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by you, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let you experience its benefits for a special introductory price of $140. Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your experience! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $140. While this is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. I'm glad to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of your offer, I propose a price of $135 for our premium product. This still allows you to enjoy its benefits while keeping costs reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $15 more than her minimum acceptable price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price while avoiding the risk of a longer negotiation or ending up paying more to John."
