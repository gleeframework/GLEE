"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130. How about we try $137.50?",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $137.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $135?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $136, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",136.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $136, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $138 and $136. How about we try $137?",137.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $136, and I'm starting to think it's not worth it. I'd rather buy it from John for $120. I'm out of offers, so I'm ending the negotiation.",136.0,Bob,10,
