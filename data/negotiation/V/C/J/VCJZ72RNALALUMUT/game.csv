"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $9,500 right now.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little outside my comfort zone.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a great offer, but I'm not willing to give away too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10,800 is a good price, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to do $10,200? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Let's make this happen!",10200.0,Bob,6,
