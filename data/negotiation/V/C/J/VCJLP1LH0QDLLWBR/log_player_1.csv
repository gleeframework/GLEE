"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price. It's becoming clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to an even lower offer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me the minimum value I'm comfortable with."
