"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with.",900000.0,Bob,4,
