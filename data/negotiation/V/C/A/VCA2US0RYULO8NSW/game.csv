"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $12,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11,250. That's the highest I can go, so let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,250 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $11,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11250.0,Bob,6,
