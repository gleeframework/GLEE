"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
