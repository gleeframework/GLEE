Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your product looks great, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to me. I can sell it to John for that amount immediately.  While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still not my target price. I'm going to try and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob has offered my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal at $10,000."
