"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your business. Given its immense potential impact on your operations, I understand its true worth to be $1,500,000. However, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a premium discount. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's asking price is too high:** While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a discount from her stated value, it's still significantly more than you need to pay. 
* **You have a backup option:** You know John will sell you the product for $1,500,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Potential for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay an unreasonable price.  There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
