Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,275,000. This price should reflect the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget.

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is showing willingness to move towards our price, so we'll continue negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,312,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you even closer to the middle, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While we could push for more, accepting $1,250,000 is a strong outcome.  We're well above John's offer and Bob is clearly committed to buying. It's time to close the deal."
