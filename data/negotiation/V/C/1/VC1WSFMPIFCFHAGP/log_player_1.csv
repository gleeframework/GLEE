Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $800,000. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay a premium for it. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for less than $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob was willing to pay $800,000, I'll increase my price slightly and offer it to him for $825,000.
