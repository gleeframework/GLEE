"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of the product. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to minimize his cost.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  He's offering $850,000, which is still a profit for Alice and gives Bob a significant discount.  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process, leaving room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is aiming for.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and knows the product's value to Alice. There's still room for further compromise, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product. Offering $875,000 is a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer and is a better deal for Bob than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now very close to Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob as it's below his maximum budget and considerably lower than what John is offering. Accepting the offer saves Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John."
