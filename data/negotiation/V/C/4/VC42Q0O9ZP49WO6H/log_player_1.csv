"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe it's worth more than $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price. I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with $115. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum price, and it's closer to my initial asking price. I hope this will be more appealing to him than the $105 he offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my target, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm not ready to sell for $107, especially with more rounds left to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to push him higher with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's still below his maximum price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground to reach a deal before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though $108 is closer to my target, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet ready to settle for $108, especially since I'm confident in the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm offering $109. I've lowered my price again, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This is a fair offer for both of us, as it's still above my minimum price and close to Bob's current offer. With only a few rounds left, I hope this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer. With only two rounds left, I need to see if we can come to an agreement before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I've lowered the price to $107, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer. With only one round left, I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Unfortunately, Bob's final offer of $104 is too low for me to accept.  With only one round remaining, I have no time to make another counteroffer.  It's better to sell the product to John for $100 than to risk getting nothing at all."
