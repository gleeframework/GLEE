"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $12,000. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love the product and I'm willing to make a concession to get us to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
