"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $810,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and seems firm on her price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result, and there's a risk Alice could walk away. It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
