"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,500. He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This is a fair price considering your value of the product and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.**  This is lower than Bob's initial limit of $12,000 and closer to his desired price.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Bob has already rejected a counteroffer, and Alice has shown she's firm on her price.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a higher price. 
* **Accepting is the best option:**  Buying from Alice at $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
