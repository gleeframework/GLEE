"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. While she's trying to convince you it's worth more than $100, you know your own valuation. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, I'm aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Staying Below My Limit:** My offer is still well below my $100 maximum, giving me flexibility.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she flat out refuses, I know I might need to increase my offer more aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $85 is still above my target. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further before resorting to buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $78, I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer ($70) and her current price ($85). 
* **Staying Strategic:** This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating my willingness to be flexible. It also puts the pressure back on Alice to either accept a price closer to my range or make a significant counter-offer."
