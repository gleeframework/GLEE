"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $13,000. This is a special opportunity considering its value to you is $15,000. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum budget, there is still potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me and your profit margin, I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer. Considering the value of the product to you and the cost to produce it, I would like to counter with an offer of $12,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $12,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $3,000 less than his maximum budget.  While there's a chance to negotiate further, the risk of a stalemate or Alice walking away is increasing. Accepting her offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking losing the deal."
