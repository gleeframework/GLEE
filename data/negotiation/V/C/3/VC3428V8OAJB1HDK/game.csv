"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $600,000 feels more in line with its market value. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. However, my assessment is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a substantial gap from my valuation. To keep this moving, I could go up to $700,000.  Do you think we can find common ground there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground, but the value I place on this product is significantly higher. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit from its potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains quite wide. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's about as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
