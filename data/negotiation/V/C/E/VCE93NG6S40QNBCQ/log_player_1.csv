**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $18,000, Bob is consistently moving upward in his offers.  At this point, the difference between his offer ($17,500) and my safety net with John ($15,000) is significant enough to warrant accepting. It's better to secure a deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
