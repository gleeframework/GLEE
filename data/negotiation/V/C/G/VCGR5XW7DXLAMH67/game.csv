"I'm not willing to go any lower than $118, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm not interested in selling it to you for $80, as it's below my minimum price.",118.0,Alice,9,
