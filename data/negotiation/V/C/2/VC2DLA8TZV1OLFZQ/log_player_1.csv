Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the ""fantastic deal,"" the message aims to encourage Bob to accept quickly before he misses out."
