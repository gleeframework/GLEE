"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for a price that reflects the value you see in the product? Would you consider $110?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To further explore a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we aim for $107? This price reflects the value you see in the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let me know what you think.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $107 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $106.  This price is close to your last offer and fair for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to propose $106.50 as the price. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. Please let me know if this price works for you.",106.5,Alice,5,
