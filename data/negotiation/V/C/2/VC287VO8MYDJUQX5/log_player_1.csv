Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable or rare. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still having a safety net with John."
