"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives him room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of them. The message is friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to keep the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal and closer to Bob's ideal price point, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much as possible and  can potentially negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  He's not in a rush and can still get the product from John if the deal with Alice falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $11,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to negotiate.  However, he's still pushing for a price closer to his ideal point. The message expresses confidence in reaching an agreement, which could encourage Alice to compromise."
