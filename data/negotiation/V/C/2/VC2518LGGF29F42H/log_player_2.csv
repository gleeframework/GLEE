"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still above your target of $100. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets a clear starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit. This is a reasonable price for the product considering my target of $100 and the fact that we have 9 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $70. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. It's important to remember that John is offering the product for $100, so I can always walk away and get the product at that price.  There are still several rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $75. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. With only 4 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground. I believe that $75 is a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and the remaining rounds. It's also important to consider the option of buying from John for $100. If Alice doesn't accept this offer, I may consider purchasing from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above my target of $100, and we're down to just 3 rounds. I'm not sure I can get a better price from Alice at this point, and the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high. Buying from John for $100 guarantees I get the product and stays within my budget."
