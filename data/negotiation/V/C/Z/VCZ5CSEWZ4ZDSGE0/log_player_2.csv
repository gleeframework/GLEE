"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500, and I can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
