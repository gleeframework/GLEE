{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $125 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell the product to John for $100, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob, especially since he's already expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $110, $105 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's also better than selling to John for $100."
