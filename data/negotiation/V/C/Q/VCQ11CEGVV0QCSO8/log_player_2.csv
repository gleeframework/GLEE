# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value to us, but considering its significance to you, we believe it's time to share this treasure. We propose a fair transaction of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects not only its market value but also acknowledges its importance to you. We hope this offer aligns with your expectations and enables us to facilitate a mutually beneficial exchange. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
