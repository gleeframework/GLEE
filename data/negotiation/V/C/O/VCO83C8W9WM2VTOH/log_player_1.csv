Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Secure a Good Alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob."
