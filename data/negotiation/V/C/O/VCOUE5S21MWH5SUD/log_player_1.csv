Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is below my minimum, and I still have time to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price allows us both to get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price. While I would prefer to sell for more, it's a fair deal for both of us."
