"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm starting with a price of $1000000, which reflects its true value. I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850000,  which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price allows us both to get a fair deal. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
