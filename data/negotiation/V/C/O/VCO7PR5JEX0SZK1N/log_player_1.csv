Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential range where both you and Bob benefit. Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually agreeable.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy might make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're setting a strong starting point that leans towards your desired outcome.
* **Value Highlight:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Sense of Urgency (Without Being Aggressive):** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act without feeling overly pressured. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate within the ZOPA, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:** While maximizing profit is key, consider the long-term implications. If you want a future relationship with Bob, being overly aggressive might not be the best approach."
