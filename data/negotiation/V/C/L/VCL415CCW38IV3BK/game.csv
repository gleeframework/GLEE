"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth while also being more in line with your initial offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $700000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $650000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $650000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer $662500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",662500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $662500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $680000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $670000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really hoping we can meet on this price, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",670000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm not willing to go above $670000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay more. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not willing to go any higher than $670000.",670000.0,Bob,10,
