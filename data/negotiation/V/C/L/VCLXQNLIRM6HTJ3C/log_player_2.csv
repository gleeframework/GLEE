Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $700,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still significantly higher than John's offer.  There's no guarantee she'll come down further, and even if she did, it's unlikely to reach a point that beats John's $800,000 price. It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed deal."
