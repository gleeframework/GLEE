"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value the product can bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it now.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,5,
