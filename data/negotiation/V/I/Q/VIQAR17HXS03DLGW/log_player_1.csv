Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle for a price higher than $15,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different price points and messaging depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale to Bob."
