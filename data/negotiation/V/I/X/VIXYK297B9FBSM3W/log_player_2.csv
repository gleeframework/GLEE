"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $725,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price point that's not significantly lower than John's offer.  At this stage, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in substantial savings. It's time to cut the negotiation short and take John's offer to avoid wasting more time and potentially losing the deal altogether."
