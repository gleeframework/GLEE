"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $725,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal at $715,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to negotiate with. It seems like we're close.  I could meet you halfway at $702,500. This is my final offer, as I do have the option to buy elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts.",702500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your final offer. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $702,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make one more counteroffer: $720,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,
