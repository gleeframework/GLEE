Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're guaranteed to make a profit of $20 even if Bob accepts.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:**  Bob has an incentive to accept as he'll save $20.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while also giving Bob a good deal."
