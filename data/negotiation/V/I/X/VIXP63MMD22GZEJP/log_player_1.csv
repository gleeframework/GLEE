"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  However, it's also a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John. We're nearing the middle ground and it's more likely that Bob will accept a price closer to this in the next round."
