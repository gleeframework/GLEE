"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $11,000 since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000. Rejecting the offer gives you an opportunity to counteroffer and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer offers a price slightly above Alice's minimum, indicating you are serious about buying but aiming for a better price.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also shows you're not just trying to lowball her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, but still higher than my ideal price. Rejecting her offer allows me to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good deal. This counteroffer aims to find a midpoint and incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still not ideal. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation, as I could end up paying more or potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John. Buying from John guarantees a price within my budget."
