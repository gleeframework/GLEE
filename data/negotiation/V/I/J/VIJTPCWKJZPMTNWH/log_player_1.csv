Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best we can do. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

I'm still not satisfied with $9,125. While it's closer to my desired price, I want to see if I can get a bit more in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm also looking to get a fair price for my product.  Let's meet in the middle again at $9,187.50.  This is a small adjustment from your last offer, and it's a good compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9187.5}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9062.50. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,062.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are nearing the end of our rounds with Bob, and while $9,062.50 is a decent price, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with an offer that's too low. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get the price I deserve."
