"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9000. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not convinced that $9000 is the best we can do. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9125. Can you consider this price?",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm also looking to get a fair price for my product.  Let's meet in the middle again at $9187.50.  This is a small adjustment from your last offer, and it's a good compromise.  What do you think?",9187.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9062.50. Can you consider this price?",9062.5,Bob,8,
