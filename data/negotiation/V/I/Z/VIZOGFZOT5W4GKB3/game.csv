"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10000, so you'll be getting a good discount. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a good price for you, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
