"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Product Value:** You value the product at $100, and Alice values it at $80. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Offer:** $95 is too high for you, considering your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation:** It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to a counteroffer, potentially saving some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident I can find a buyer for this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Value Proposition:**  You emphasize that this price still represents a good profit for Alice.
* **Market Knowledge:**  You mention being confident in finding a buyer at that price, suggesting Alice might lose out if she rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a very competitive price for this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, $90 is still above your ideal.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate further. You can potentially secure a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.
* **Jhon's Price:**  While $100 from Jhon is an option, it's still worth trying to get a better price from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $87? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this! "", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:**  Instead of a large jump, you're offering a smaller decrease to $87, showing you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, fostering a cooperative tone.
* **Urgency:** The ""let's close this"" statement subtly adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Alice to accept."
