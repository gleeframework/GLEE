"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000).
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's ample opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** While John offers a guaranteed price, it's your most expensive option."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's a slight improvement, it's still above what the product is worth to her. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 7 rounds left, which gives you time to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** While you're getting closer to a potential deal with Alice, it's still better to keep exploring negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.

* **You have time to negotiate.** You have 5 rounds left, giving you the ability to continue pushing for a better deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to compromise. While I see the value you place on the product, I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's trying to meet you halfway, $980,000 is still above your desired price range and more than the product's worth to her. 
* **You have time to negotiate.** You have 3 rounds left, allowing you to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a risky option.**  While you're getting close to a potential deal with Alice, buying from John will cost you significantly more. You still have a chance to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though she's making a final offer, $987,500 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to her. 
* **You have one round left.** While it seems like you're close to a deal, you have one more round to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a significant cost.** You're on the cusp of a better deal with Alice, and buying from John will be significantly more expensive.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* **Make a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value.**  Try to meet her halfway again, but aim for a price closer to $900,000. Explain that you're willing to make a final concession to secure the deal."
