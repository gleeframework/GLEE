"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm counteroffering $920,000 for the product.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to compromise. While I see the value you place on the product, I'm still not comfortable with $920,000. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm counteroffering $980,000 for the product.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $980,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $875,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $1,200,000, which is $987,500. I'm making one final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",987500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a solution here. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, $987,500 is still a bit high for me. As this is my final offer, I'm willing to compromise and offer you $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal. I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,10,
