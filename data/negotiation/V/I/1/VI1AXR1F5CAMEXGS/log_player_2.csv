"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm confident will benefit your business greatly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Rejecting her offer opens the door to potentially getting a better price closer to her valuation of $8,000."
