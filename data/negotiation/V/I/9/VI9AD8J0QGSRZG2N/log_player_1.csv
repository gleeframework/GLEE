{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $11,500 is still significantly lower than Bob's valuation of $12,000, giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth, allowing you to adjust your price based on Bob's response.

This is a good starting point, but remember to adjust your strategy based on how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your initial offer of $11,500.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would still give you a great price and allow me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's closer to Bob's offer, but still allows you to make a profit.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** By offering a specific price, you're encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10750 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $10200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd ideally want.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and get closer to your desired price.  At this point, it might be beneficial to consider a slightly higher counteroffer, but be mindful of the risk of losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10,200 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,400.  This is a fair price for both of us - it's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10400}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to compromise:**  It's a slight decrease from your previous offer.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** It could encourage Bob to make a final move.
* **Highlights the mutual benefit:** Emphasizing the value for both parties can be persuasive. 

Remember, if Bob still rejects this offer, you have the option of selling to John for $10,000. This allows you to decide whether the potential for further negotiation with Bob is worth the risk of losing the deal completely."
