"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would still give you a great price and allow me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10750 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $10200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10200 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more to $10400.  This is a fair price for both of us - it's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen!",10400.0,Alice,5,
