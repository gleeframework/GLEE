"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and it's a solid starting point for us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to recover some of my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no more. Can you consider my revised offer?",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $990,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal, and allows me to recover a good portion of my investment.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000, but no more. Can you consider my revised offer?",1010000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,015,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you, while still allowing me to recover a significant portion of my investment.  Let's close this deal. ",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is a final offer from me.  It's a fair price that gives you a great deal, and allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment.  Let's close this deal now. ",1010000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I've reached my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,002,000, but no more. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1002000.0,Bob,10,
