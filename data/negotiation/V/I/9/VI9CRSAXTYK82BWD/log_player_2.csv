(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, you have room to bargain.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good price.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'll continue trying to get a better price.  There's still room for a lower price, and I have several rounds left to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, but still staying well below Alice's price.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's good for me."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm still not at my limit. It's better to keep trying to get a lower price rather than settling for this offer. There are still enough rounds left to make a deal that works better for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 920000}
```

I'm gradually increasing my offer, trying to find a middle ground. Alice has shown flexibility, and with several rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close a deal that's advantageous for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, we're running out of rounds. Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, and I'm starting to risk losing the opportunity altogether. It's better to secure the product at this price rather than potentially being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
