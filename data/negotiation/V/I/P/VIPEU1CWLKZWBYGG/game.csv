"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $140. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $140 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $155? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need for the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Bob,4,
