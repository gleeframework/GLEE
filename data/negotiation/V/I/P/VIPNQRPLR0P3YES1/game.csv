,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm willing to go up to $108, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and $108 is a good offer. However, I'm only willing to go down to $112. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to reach a fair price for my product. What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,
