"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can offer a lower price and see if she's willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $110 is closer to your target, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm willing to go up to $108, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and $108 is a good offer. However, I'm only willing to go down to $112. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to reach a fair price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's likely that Alice is not willing to go much lower. Since John is offering the product for $100, it's the better option to buy from him and save the additional $12."
