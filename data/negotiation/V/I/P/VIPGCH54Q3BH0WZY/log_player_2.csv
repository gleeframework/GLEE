# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing further, so feel free to share your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is lower than $8,000 to Alice, so I'm trying to meet in the middle.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to its worth is fair.  Would you consider $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice's new offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. I'm trying to get closer to the $8,000 mark, which is the value Alice has on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer, this time at $10,000. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway and get closer to the price she has in mind, while also saving some money.

{""message"": ""I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
