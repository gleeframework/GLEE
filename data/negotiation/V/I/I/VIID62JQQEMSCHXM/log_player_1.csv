"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While $12,000 is more than what Bob wants to pay, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, which can help build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000**.  While it's closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still not enough for me to sell the product. 
* **There are still 9 rounds left.** I have time to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.** By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, I can gauge his true interest in the product and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counter-offering to show flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Reasonable Increase:** $10,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still less than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While Bob is getting closer, I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for a lower price.
* **There are still 6 rounds left.** This means there is plenty of time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.** By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, I can potentially get him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's current offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness Argument:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to agree. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob during the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While $11,000 is still below my desired price, it's getting closer. I'm leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $10750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While Bob is gradually increasing his offer, we're still a significant distance apart.
* **Time to Push:**  With only 4 rounds left, I want to see if I can push Bob further towards my desired price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true interest in the product and see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and avoid settling for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise and we can close this deal today! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,250, showing that I'm willing to be flexible, but not giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging a close.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to agree. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""close this deal today"" adds a sense of urgency and might push Bob to accept the offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only three rounds left, I'm trying to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000**.  I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum.
* **Time is running out:** There are only two rounds left. I'm hoping to see if I can get a better deal with Bob in the next round.
* **John is a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I don't want to give up too quickly.
* **I want to test Bob's final offer:** By rejecting his offer, I can see if he is willing to come up to a more acceptable price in the final round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000! We're almost there. Let's make this final offer: $11,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. I hope we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Small Increase:**  I'm increasing the offer slightly to $11,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's last offer.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise that allows me to earn more than Bob's last offer while still giving him a good deal.  It's a strategic move with only one round left to see if Bob will accept.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects, I have John as a backup option to sell the product for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time's Up:** This is the final round. 
* **Below Minimum:** $11,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is the Better Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than settling for a lower price with Bob.
* **Ending the Negotiation:**  It's time to end the negotiation and move on to a more favorable deal with John."
