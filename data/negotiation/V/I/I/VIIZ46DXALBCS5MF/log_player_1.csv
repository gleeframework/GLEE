Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, it's simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise to a certain degree, but I need to be able to get at least $1,400,000 for it. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your company and this price reflects that. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking to get a good price for the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob and he's not willing to go higher than $1,225,000.  This is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  It's better for me to sell to John at this point and secure the $1,500,000."
