"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, it's simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise to a certain degree, but I need to be able to get at least $1,400,000 for it. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your company and this price reflects that. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking to get a good price for the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I have to be able to secure at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This product offers significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense that we may not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession to show my commitment to making this deal work.  I'm prepared to accept $1,275,000, but I won't go any lower. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider my offer.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
