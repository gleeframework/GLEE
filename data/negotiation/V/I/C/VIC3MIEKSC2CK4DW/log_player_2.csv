"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point for the negotiation. It is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I am serious about buying the product but not willing to pay an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $130 is still above both your budget and John's offer.  Negotiation should continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. It is still below your maximum budget while showing Alice you are willing to increase your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $115 is my final offer - it's a great deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm on a price that's not beneficial to you. It's clear you won't get a price you're comfortable with from Alice. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
