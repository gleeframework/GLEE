"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm leaving room for negotiation in case he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130, which is still above my minimum value of $120 but lower than my initial offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price to $115, which is closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise and encourages him to come up a bit more. I still have five rounds left, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum value, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I have to prioritize getting at least my minimum value, and John offers a guaranteed $120.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
