"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is close to your $100 limit, you can likely get a better price. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to her $80 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step closer to Alice's value, but still gives you some room for negotiation.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still attempting to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to deal, or you could run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price."
