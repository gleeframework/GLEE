Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by finding a price attractive to Bob while ensuring you don't lose out if he declines."
