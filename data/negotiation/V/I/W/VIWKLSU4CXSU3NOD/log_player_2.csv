Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're interested, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to your target, you have the option to buy from John for $8,000.  It makes more financial sense to secure the product at the lower price from John, even if it means ending negotiations with Alice."
