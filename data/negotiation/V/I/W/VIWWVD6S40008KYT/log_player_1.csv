Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm willing to let it go for $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the ""exclusive opportunity"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($15,000).

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
