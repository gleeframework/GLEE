"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to discussion. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I can afford. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17500 to meet you halfway. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial limits. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stick to my budget. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $14500. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and hopefully, it's a figure you can work with.",14500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,6,,
