Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to discussion. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I can afford. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not comfortable accepting Bob's offer at $10,000.  It's far below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to meet you halfway. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial limits. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stick to my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12,000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $14,500. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and hopefully, it's a figure you can work with."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I'll take the $15,000 from John, which is more than my minimum."
