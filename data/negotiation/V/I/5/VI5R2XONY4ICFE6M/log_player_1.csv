{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still below my ideal target price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a little too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and getting closer to my ideal price.  It's time to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
