Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $150, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go higher, and $135 is a decent profit above my minimum."
