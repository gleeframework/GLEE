"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
