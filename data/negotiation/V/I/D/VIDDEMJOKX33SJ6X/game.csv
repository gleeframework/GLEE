"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's potential to benefit your business. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product has value, and I'm prepared to offer $850000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $850000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
