Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. It's also a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum threshold. It's likely Bob will be willing to accept this, given he's already indicated he values the product at $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get more, $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount.  Further negotiation could result in a lower price for me, so accepting this offer is the best option."
