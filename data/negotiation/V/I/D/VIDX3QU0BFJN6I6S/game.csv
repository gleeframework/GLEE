"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is fair for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
