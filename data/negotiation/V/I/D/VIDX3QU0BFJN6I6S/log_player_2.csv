"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to try and reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit.  You're still within your rounds and have a chance to negotiate further.  You can try to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, which I believe is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
