"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to set a price that reflects its worth to me. I'm starting with an offer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
