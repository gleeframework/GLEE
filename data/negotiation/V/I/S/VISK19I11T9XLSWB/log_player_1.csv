"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $900,000.  Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so this gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John at any time, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering the product for $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get closer to $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to drop my price slightly again, offering $825,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate further. However, it still leaves me with a profit that I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to $800,000.  I still have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm going to make my final offer of $800,000. This is my bottom line, as I can sell the product to John for this price.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this price and accept."
