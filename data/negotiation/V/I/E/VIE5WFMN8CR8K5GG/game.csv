"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is still too far off. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident you won't regret it.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  Let's try $12,000.  It's a significant compromise on my part, but it's the most I can do.",12000.0,Bob,4,
