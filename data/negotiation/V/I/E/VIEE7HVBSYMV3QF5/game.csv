"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum price. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
