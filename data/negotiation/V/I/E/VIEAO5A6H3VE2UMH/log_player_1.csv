Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value.  This creates a sense of a deal while leaving you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing that Bob is getting the ""first offer"" and a ""special price,"" you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity that might encourage him to accept."
