"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($12,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. You can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will want to sell the product for more than her minimum value of $10,000, but this offer shows you're serious about buying and willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price. You can still try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise.  It still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit, but it's closer to your target price. You are hoping that Alice will accept this offer as she is likely eager to close the deal.  If she rejects it, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly close to John's price. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. You are likely not going to get a price lower than $12,750 from Alice, and it is more advantageous to buy from John for $15,000. You are still getting the product for a price that is within your budget."
