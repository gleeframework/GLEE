"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum. Let's start our negotiation journey!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still far above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have multiple rounds.** You're not under pressure to accept the first offer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fall apart. 

By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  That's still a significant profit for you, and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.  However, it's still well above Alice's minimum value, leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Focus on the mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the benefits for both sides, making the offer more appealing to Alice. 
* **Keeps options open:** You're still willing to negotiate, indicating you're not just trying to lowball her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your ideal price, it's still above your target. You've shown you're willing to negotiate, so there's no need to accept this offer yet.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always buy from John if you can't agree with Alice.

By rejecting, you maintain your negotiating position and demonstrate that you are determined to achieve a price that is more favorable to you."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my willingness to meet you halfway, while still securing a good deal for myself.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** You're showing Alice that you're committed to finding a solution.
* **Meeting halfway (almost):** This offer is a smaller step than before, showing you're serious about closing the deal. It also gives Alice a sense of progress and makes it harder for her to reject without offering a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a balance:**  The offer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's also lower than what Alice has offered.
* **Positive message:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and encourages Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  Let's try $890,000. It's a smaller jump, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution. I'm confident that this price will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target:** Her offer is now only $40,000 above your ideal price of $850,000.
* **There are only 5 rounds left:**  You are approaching the middle of the negotiations. Continuing to reject could risk losing the deal, especially since John's offer is a significant backup.
* **A small compromise:**  Accepting this offer means you only have to pay $40,000 more than your ideal price. It's a small price to pay for securing the deal and potentially saving time and effort in further negotiations.

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of accepting the offer (securing the product at a reasonable price) against the risk of further negotiations (potentially getting a better price but also risking the deal falling through). In this situation, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward, especially considering the time constraint and the availability of John's offer."
