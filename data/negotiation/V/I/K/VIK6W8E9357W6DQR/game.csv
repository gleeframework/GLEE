"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $11,000 for this product. It's a fair price, considering its value. Let's try to find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $10,000? That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
