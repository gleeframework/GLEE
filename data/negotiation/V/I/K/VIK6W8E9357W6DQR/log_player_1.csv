This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to $13,000 as possible, but I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and the potential of selling to John for $12,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for $9,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."

I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500, and Bob is unwilling to go higher than $10,400. We're too far apart.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
