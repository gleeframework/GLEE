"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given its value to me is only $1,000,000, I would like to propose a price closer to that amount. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This gives you a great price, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's find a way to make this work!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,060,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,065,000. It's a small step closer to my goal, and a good compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",1065000.0,Alice,5,
