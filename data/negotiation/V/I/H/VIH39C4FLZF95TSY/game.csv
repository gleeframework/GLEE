"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget. Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,200 is tempting, but I have a strict budget for this purchase.  Would you be willing to do $7,800? That's the most I can offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,800 is as low as you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,7,
