Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he's unlikely to pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential negotiation range between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. 

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer slightly below Bob's maximum value to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Justification:**  Highlight the product's value and why it's worth the price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  I'm confident this will be a valuable investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while staying above your minimum.
* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your price, but never go below $1,500,000.
* **John is your Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage in the negotiation."
