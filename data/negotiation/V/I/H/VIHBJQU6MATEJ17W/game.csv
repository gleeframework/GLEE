"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still a great deal.  What do you say to a price of $12,500?  This would give you a significant saving compared to its true value to you, and it would ensure I get a price I'm happy with.  Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,1,
