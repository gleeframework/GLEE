{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for this product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and you'd still be getting a great deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target of $15,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as I'd get the product, and you'd still make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
