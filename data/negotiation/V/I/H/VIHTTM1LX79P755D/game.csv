"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for this product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $15,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and you'd still be getting a great deal. Let's make this happen!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as I'd get the product, and you'd still make a profit. What do you say?",15500.0,Bob,4,
