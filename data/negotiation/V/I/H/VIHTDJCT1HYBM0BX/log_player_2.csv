"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This represents a significant value proposition, as you've already estimated its worth at $1,500,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You'll still pay more than what the product is worth to Alice, but it's the best deal available."
