"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my desired price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm thinking $12,000 would be a more fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll still find this a great value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm really sticking to my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept given the limited rounds, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try $12,500. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 12500}
