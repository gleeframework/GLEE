Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get a good chunk of that value. I'll offer it to him for $750,000.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I think I can do better than $700,000. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob the product for $725,000.
