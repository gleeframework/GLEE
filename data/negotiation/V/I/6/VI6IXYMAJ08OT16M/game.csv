,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, but I want to make sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $925,000 is still just not enough for me. How about $940,000?  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal, I know you'll be happy with this product.",940000.0,Alice,5,
