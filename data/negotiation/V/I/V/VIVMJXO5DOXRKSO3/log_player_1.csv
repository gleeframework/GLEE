Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose him as a buyer.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,450,000 reflects its worth. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, acknowledges the value to Bob, and subtly introduces a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Price:**  $1,450,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, making it a good deal for him while netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* **Information:** In real-world scenarios, you might not know Bob's exact valuation. Gathering information is crucial for effective negotiation."
