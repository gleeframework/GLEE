Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to create a win-win situation where you get a good price, and Bob feels like he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you would ideally like to get for the product. You have a chance to get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to pay $105 for it?  That's still below what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial ask, Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's a reasonable price for both parties, and you're still earning a significant profit above your minimum of $80.  There's a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to a stalemate or you having to sell to John for $80.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic choice in this situation."
