Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By stating ""at this price"" we imply the offer might not last, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will reject $149.  However, we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no risk of losing money. This strategy aims to get the best possible outcome with Bob while having a safety net."
