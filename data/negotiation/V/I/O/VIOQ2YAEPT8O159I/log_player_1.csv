Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a strong opening point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Knowing Bob's value:**  I'm aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so this offer is within his range of acceptable value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for some negotiation if Bob counters. It avoids pushing him to immediately reject.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  Even if Bob makes a lower counteroffer, I have a fallback option with John, guaranteeing me at least $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer:** This indicates that he's trying to negotiate, and I can likely push him further.
* **My minimum threshold:** I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,100,000, as I know the product is worth more to Bob and I have a backup buyer in John who will pay $800,000.
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:** This keeps the negotiation alive, potentially leading to a final price that is more favorable for me.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** It's risky to reject Bob's offer and then offer a price lower than his counteroffer, as this could make him less willing to negotiate further.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,150,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob is getting closer to my minimum:** While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still determined to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and keep negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push Bob to offer a higher price, especially since he has already shown a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy keeps the negotiation active and positions me to potentially get a better price while still having a guaranteed fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway again:** This counteroffer is right in the middle between my last offer and Bob's. It shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Close to Bob's valuation:** I'm aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and this offer is still significantly less.
* **Above John's offer:** This counteroffer is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, ensuring I get a good deal. 
* **Creating pressure:** By showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway, it might create some pressure on Bob to accept the deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a good way to see if Bob is serious about reaching an agreement or if he's just trying to stall for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob has consistently offered lower prices, and it's becoming clear that we are reaching a stalemate.
* **John's offer is now the best option:**  $1,000,000 is only slightly better than John's offer of $800,000.  The potential gains are not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiations could take longer, and I'm confident I can close the deal with John quickly.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me a solid profit and avoids the possibility of Bob continuing to push for a lower price. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting John's offer is the most sensible decision at this point, ensuring a quick and secure sale."
