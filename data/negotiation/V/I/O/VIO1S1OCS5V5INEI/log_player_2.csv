"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value to me, and I believe it represents a great deal for you. While I'm confident in selling it to another buyer for a higher price, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a reduction from her true value, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a lower price of $1,200,000."
