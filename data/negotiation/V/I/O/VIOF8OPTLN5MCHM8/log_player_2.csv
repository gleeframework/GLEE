Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product to you for $105. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $108. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting $108 gets you the product for a price well below your $150 alternative.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks pushing Alice away entirely."
