"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($120) is higher than your maximum budget ($80) and higher than John's price ($80).** 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to buy from John at your desired price."
