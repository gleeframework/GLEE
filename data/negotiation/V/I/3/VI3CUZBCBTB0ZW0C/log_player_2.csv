"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price closer to Alice's value of $100 while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, there's still room for negotiation. A counteroffer closer to $100 seems reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer ($110) and my previous counteroffer ($105). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
