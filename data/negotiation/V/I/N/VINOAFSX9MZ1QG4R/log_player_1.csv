{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is closer to my minimum value ($12,000) than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This allows for negotiation space while still maximizing my potential earnings.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value for Bob may encourage him to see it as a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adapt my strategy. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **Counter-Offers:**  If Bob's counteroffer is reasonable, I'll consider it.  However, I won't go below my minimum value ($12,000). 
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price, securing a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested in the product. I can use this opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, which guarantees my desired profit. However, I'd prefer to explore a potential deal with Bob, as there's room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll be cautious but willing to compromise to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price reflects the product's value and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I again emphasize the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Fair Deal:** I frame it as a ""fair deal for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response. If he rejects again, I might consider a slight price reduction or even explore selling to John. However, I'll aim for a price as close to $10,500 as possible to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with his ""highest"" offer of $9,800, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my minimum. This suggests that further negotiation could lead to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is still a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would ensure a guaranteed profit. However, I believe there's a chance to secure a slightly better price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll be prepared to compromise slightly to reach an agreement, but I won't go below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment. How about $10,200? This is a fair price considering the product's value and it's as low as I can go. I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Adjustment:** I'm emphasizing this is my ""final adjustment"" to encourage Bob to close the deal.
* **Fair Price Justification:**  I reiterate that this price is ""fair"" considering the product's value. 
* **Low Point:** I explicitly state this is my ""lowest"" price to create a sense of urgency and limit further negotiation.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I express confidence in the product's value to create positive feelings and encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

I'm cautiously optimistic. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer of $12,000 to avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed profit. However, I'm still hoping to reach an agreement with Bob, as $10,200 is closer to my desired price."
