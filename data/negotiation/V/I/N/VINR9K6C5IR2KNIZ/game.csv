"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $80 for it. This is my absolute maximum, let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $90.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, but $90 is getting closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm feeling  a little strapped for cash right now, so I'm going to have to stick to my offer of $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,8,
