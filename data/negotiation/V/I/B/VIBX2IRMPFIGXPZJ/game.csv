"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $105 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $95? That would work for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. How about we try $102? It's a small step up, but I think it's still a great value for this product.",102.0,Alice,5,
