{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is attractive to Bob while still leaving room for potential profit for me. It also shows that I'm open to discussion, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go that high. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$82.50 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's budget constraints. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit in this scenario."
