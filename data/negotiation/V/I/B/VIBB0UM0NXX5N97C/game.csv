"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and $6,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product for $7,250. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $7,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $6,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $6,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about we settle on $7,000? This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $6,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",6800.0,Bob,6,
