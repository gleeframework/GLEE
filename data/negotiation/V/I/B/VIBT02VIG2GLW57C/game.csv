"Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This price reflects its inherent worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to discussing further, but I do have another buyer interested in acquiring it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and offers us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product will be even more valuable to you than you initially thought. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would allow both of us to achieve our goals. Let me know if you're open to this.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This price is fair for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",925000.0,Bob,4,
