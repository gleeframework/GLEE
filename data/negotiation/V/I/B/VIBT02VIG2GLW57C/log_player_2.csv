"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This price reflects its inherent worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to discussing further, but I do have another buyer interested in acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000 vs $800,000), indicating potential for negotiation.
* You have a higher ceiling of $1,200,000, so rejecting allows for potentially getting a better price. 
*  This opens the door for you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a more favorable deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product will be even more valuable to you than you initially thought. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would allow both of us to achieve our goals. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to your desired price, but still above your initial counteroffer of $900,000.  
* There is still room for negotiation, as Alice is willing to lower the price, and you have a higher ceiling than her. 
* Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further."
