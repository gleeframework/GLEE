Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $15,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we compromise at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to offer a price just slightly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility, I can get him to accept a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I've done some research and found that the product is typically valued around $16000, but I'd like to stay within my budget. I propose a final offer of $15750. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750

Bob's offer is $15,750, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and also close to my initial asking price.  With only 4 rounds left, accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my earnings."
