"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at your limit, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I can offer it to you for $10,375, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it.",10375.0,Alice,7,
