"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Although $140 is within my budget, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still reasonably above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of securing a lower price. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is framed positively, expressing interest while clearly stating my counteroffer.
* **Strategic Aim:** My ideal outcome is to purchase the product somewhere between $110 and $130."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $130 is a fair price, falling right in the middle of Alice's valuation ($120) and my initial counteroffer ($110).
* **Saves Money:** It's significantly cheaper than John's offer of $150.
* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice raising her price or me missing out on the deal entirely."
