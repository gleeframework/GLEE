Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $130. It's lower than my original offer but still higher than Bob's offer and my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price. While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $120 is better than accepting Bob's offer of $100."
