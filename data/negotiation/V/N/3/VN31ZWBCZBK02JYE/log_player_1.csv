Round 2
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your initial offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This product offers significant value, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This reflects my best offer, considering the product's true worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is offering $975,000. While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1 million, Bob's increases are getting smaller.  Accepting now secures a significant profit above our minimum, and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or us needing to go with John for $800,000."
