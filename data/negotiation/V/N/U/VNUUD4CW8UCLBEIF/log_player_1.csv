"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $120 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept for a quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for a product worth so much. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still securing a profit."
