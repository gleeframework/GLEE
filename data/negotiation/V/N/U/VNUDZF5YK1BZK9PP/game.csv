"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This would give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my valuation.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle and settle on $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
