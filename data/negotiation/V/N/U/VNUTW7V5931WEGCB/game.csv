"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I can't accept $800,000. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe the product is worth less than $825,000 to me. I would like to counter with an offer of $810,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",810000.0,Bob,4,
