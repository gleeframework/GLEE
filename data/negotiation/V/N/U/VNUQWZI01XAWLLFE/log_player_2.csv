"Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I need for this product.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its true value. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to explore other opportunities.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly above your maximum budget.  While she might come down slightly in further negotiation, it's unlikely she'll reach a price you find acceptable. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, which is the best use of your money in this scenario."
