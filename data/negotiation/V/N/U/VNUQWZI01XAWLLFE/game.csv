"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite far from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $900,000.  If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I need for this product.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its true value. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
