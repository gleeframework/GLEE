"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no incentive to negotiate further since you can get the product at the same price from John.  Buying from John eliminates the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in you paying more."
