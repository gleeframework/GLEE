I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by counter-offering.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer acceptable, considering he's already shown willingness to negotiate."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating.  John's offer is guaranteed and allows me to maximize my profit."
