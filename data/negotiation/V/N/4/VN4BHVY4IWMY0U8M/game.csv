"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the initial price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a very competitive offer for something with this much potential upside.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap between our valuations. To be frank, anything over $800,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  If you're serious about finding a deal, I think that's a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant disparity in our perception of the product's value. I've already lowered my price considerably. To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
