"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price,  knowing Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to establish a good relationship with Bob. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes negotiation. By starting high, I aim to force Bob to reveal his upper limit for the product.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate and make counteroffers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Time Constraint:** It's only round 2, and I have 10 rounds to close the deal. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer in future rounds.
* **John's Offer:** John is also offering $800,000, so there's no immediate advantage in selling to him.

**Strategy:**

While I'd love to get more, accepting this offer secures my minimum desired value and allows me to move on to other ventures.  I'm also aware that I can always try to find a better price later, but there's no guarantee of success."
