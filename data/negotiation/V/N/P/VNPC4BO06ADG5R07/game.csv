"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $12500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $11750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to work with me.",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your position, $11750 is still a bit too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $12250.  It's a fair price considering the value you've stated for the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11925? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to work with me.",11925.0,Bob,6,
