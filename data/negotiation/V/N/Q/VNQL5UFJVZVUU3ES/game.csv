"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,500,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is the maximum I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I want to find a way for us to make this deal happen. I'm willing to significantly adjust my price to $1,100,000.  This is a major concession on my end and reflects my strong desire to work with you. However, I need you to be equally invested in finding a solution. If we can't agree on a price close to this, I'll need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to go above $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product and allows us to close the deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,6,
