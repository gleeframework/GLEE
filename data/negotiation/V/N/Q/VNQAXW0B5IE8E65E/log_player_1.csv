Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a strong starting point.** It's a significant amount for Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and persuasive.** It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and invites a response.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **High initial offer:** By starting high, I signal the value of the product and leave myself room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on Bob's perspective:**  Mentioning the value to Bob can make him more likely to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly states that I'm open to discussions, making Bob feel valued.

**If Bob rejects, I'll:**

* **Assess his counteroffer:** If it's close to my minimum ( $800,000), I might consider accepting.
* **Counter-offer:** If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Always have John as a backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I won't be pressured to accept anything below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still above my minimum.**  This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.** I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.**  While $800,000 is guaranteed, I'm aiming for a higher profit with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll propose a price closer to my initial offer, perhaps $1,100,000, explaining that it's still a good deal for him.  
* **Be firm, but fair:** I'll emphasize the value of the product and be willing to compromise, but I won't accept an offer too far below my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It's likely we won't get a better offer:** Bob has made it clear this is his highest offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Securing the deal is important:**  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.

**Why this is a good decision:**

* **Minimizes risk:**  Accepting a slightly lower offer is preferable to risking no deal at all.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiations could take longer and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **Guarantees a profit:**  $1,050,000 is still a significant profit for me and worth securing."
