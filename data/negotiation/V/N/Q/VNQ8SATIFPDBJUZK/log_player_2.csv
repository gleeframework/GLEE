Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $12,200. That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you.
