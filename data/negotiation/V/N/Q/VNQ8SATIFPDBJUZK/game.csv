"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $13,500 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $13,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $12,200. That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a great deal for you.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $12,000, which is my minimum price. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to accept it if you're willing to meet me there.",12000.0,Alice,7,
