{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving room for negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. 
* Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  
* While you have a backup offer, getting a deal with Bob is ideal as it offers a much higher potential profit."
