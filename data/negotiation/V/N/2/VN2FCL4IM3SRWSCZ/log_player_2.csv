"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle? "",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my range, but I think I can still get a better deal. I'll try one more time to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for the product, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to getting a price above $10,500.  While I could try to haggle further, $11,000 is a reasonable price and saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
