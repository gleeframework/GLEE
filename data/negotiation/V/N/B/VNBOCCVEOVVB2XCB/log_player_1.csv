Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits both of us.  To start, I propose a price of $2,200,000."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for potential concessions.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will provide valuable information for your next move.
* **Safety Net:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in starting with a high offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is far off, his message suggests he's interested in negotiating. There's space to work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strong Alternative:**  You have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, giving you leverage to reject low offers and aim higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits this product offers and keeps it a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but still above your minimum):** You've dropped $300,000 from your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility but still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""unique benefits"" reinforces the value proposition and justifies a higher price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to move the negotiation towards a price point closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is just below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) but still a profitable outcome for you.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:**  Bob has moved considerably from his initial offer and is now very close to your acceptable range. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now with Bob avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and secures your profit."
