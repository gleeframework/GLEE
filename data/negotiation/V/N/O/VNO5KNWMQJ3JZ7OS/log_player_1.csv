{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. Accepting $1,200,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks losing Bob altogether."
