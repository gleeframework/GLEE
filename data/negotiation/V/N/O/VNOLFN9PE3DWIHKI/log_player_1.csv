Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I mention the product being ""unique"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to signal that I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I can potentially earn more than my minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product.
* **Leave room for bargaining:** If Bob is interested but finds the price too high, I can negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its uniqueness, but I believe $12000 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are minimal.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John,  selling to him ensures a quick and certain transaction, eliminating any risk of further negotiation."
