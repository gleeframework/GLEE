Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 and save the potential hassle of further negotiation."
