"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but that's still a bigger stretch than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $900,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's fair considering John's offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
