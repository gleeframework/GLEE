{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.  However, it's still significantly higher than what John would pay, ensuring that I maximize my profit if Bob doesn't accept."
