Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, though unlikely. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $120, Bob's maximum valuation, might seem too aggressive and discourage him immediately.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to consider."
