"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer.  The goal is to maximize savings, so rejecting the initial offer and trying to get a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This price is fair given its value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This price still represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $1,100,000 saves Bob $400,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more savings:**  Bob's initial counteroffer was already significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Alice is now willing to meet halfway, suggesting she's not willing to go much lower.

While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice would reject it, and the negotiation could drag on. At this point, accepting the offer ensures a good deal without risking a prolonged and potentially fruitless negotiation."
