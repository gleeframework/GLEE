Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and seeing if he's willing to go higher.  I also don't want to risk losing out on the full $1,200,000 from John if I settle for less now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1,110,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether.  $1,110,000 is a good price, and it's better than potentially ending up with nothing if Bob keeps rejecting my offers.  I can always try to sell to John in the future if something else comes up."
