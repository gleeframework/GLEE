"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit low considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and capabilities.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work towards it.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $850000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's the best price we can both agree on at this point. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the concessions we've both made, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, but I still feel that $875000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $912500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",912500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $912500 is still a bit high for me. We're running out of time, so I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if we can close the deal at $893750.  This is a fair price considering the concessions we've both made. If we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options.",893750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $893750 is still a bit short of my target. However, I'm willing to make one last concession to try to close the deal. I'm offering it to you for $900000, and this is as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",900000.0,Alice,9,
