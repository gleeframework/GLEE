You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches the product's value to you, there's no incentive to buy from her immediately.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer. Since you're willing to pay $120, John acts as a backup ensuring you won't lose the opportunity."
