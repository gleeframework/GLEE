"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can go up to $13,000, but I really think $13,500 is a bit too high. Can you meet me at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
