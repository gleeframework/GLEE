"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm offering $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  This still offers you a good value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and I'll offer $12,250. I'm confident this is a fair price that's in both of our best interests.",12250.0,Bob,4,
