"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the price in Bob's mind and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential,"" the aim is to justify the high asking price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends on a collaborative note, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and implying a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option (John):** While there's an offer from John, it's too early to consider it. The goal is to maximize profit, and starting with Bob allows for potential price exploration above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Accepting $850,000 would be a sure profit, but there's still a chance to secure a price closer to the initial ask (and significantly above John's offer).
* **Limited Rounds:** With 9 rounds remaining, there's time to strategically counter-offer and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's exceptional value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $200,000 demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to the desired range.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value, aiming to justify the still-high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between the initial ask and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget limitations and the fact that I value the product at $800,000, I'm prepared to offer you $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your target.
* **Exceeding Valuation:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is now significantly above his own stated valuation of $800,000. This suggests he might be persuaded to go even higher.
* **John as a Backup:** While John's offer is becoming more tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a deal above $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Counter:** Rejecting this offer allows you to present another counter-offer, aiming for a price point between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your recognition of the product's value. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This counteroffer drops $150,000 from the previous price, signaling a strong willingness to close the deal.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** The $1,150,000 price point aims to land firmly above John's offer while still leaving room for potential negotiation upwards.
* **Compromise Language:** Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" emphasizes the collaborative nature of the negotiation and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Time Consideration:** With rounds progressing, it's strategically advantageous to inch closer to a final agreement while Bob is still actively engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  Considering our previous discussions and my firm valuation, I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This price reflects the product's value while allowing both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or reaching an impasse.  The potential gains above $1,000,000 are now outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer brings a swift and positive conclusion to the negotiation, freeing you to pursue other opportunities."
