"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.

Given my budget limitations and the fact that I value the product at $800,000, I'm prepared to offer you $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
