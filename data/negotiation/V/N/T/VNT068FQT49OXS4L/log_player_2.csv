"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, which I'm sure you'll love! Would you like to make a deal at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before defaulting to John's $150 offer."
