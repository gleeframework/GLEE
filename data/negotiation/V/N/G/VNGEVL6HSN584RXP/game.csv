"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in your product, but $90 is a little more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product.  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $85?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
