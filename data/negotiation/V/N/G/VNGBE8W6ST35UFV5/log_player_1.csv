"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value, especially since it's the first round and he hasn't explored other options yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could sell to John for that amount, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with Bob.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to increase his offer further.  I'm also mindful that I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I can convince Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're already at round 6.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
