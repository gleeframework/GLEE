"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $95 is a little higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I still have some room to negotiate and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  Let's get this deal done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $87.50. While it's still slightly less than my ideal price, it's close enough, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's important to be flexible in negotiations and recognize when a deal is good enough, even if it's not perfect."
