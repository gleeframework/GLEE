Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's space for a compromise.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It signals that you value the product and aren't willing to sell it cheaply. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while remaining open to negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price. You're in a strong position because you know Bob values the product more.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell. 
* **Potentially push for a higher price:**  A counteroffer could lead to a more favorable deal.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob that's slightly lower than your initial offer but still above his offer. This will keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you're showing him that you're not willing to settle for his initial price. You're also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $950,000 is a compromise between your initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Strong Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutually beneficial outcomes, keeping the negotiation friendly and focused on finding a solution.

**This counteroffer aims to:**

* **Maximize your earnings:**  $950,000 is still a good price for you, closer to your desired range.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It's more likely Bob will accept this offer than your original one.

Let's see if Bob accepts your counteroffer or makes another counterproposal."
