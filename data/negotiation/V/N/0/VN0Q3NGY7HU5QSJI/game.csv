"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
