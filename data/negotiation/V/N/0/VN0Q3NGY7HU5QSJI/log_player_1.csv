"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal and a real value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, and will be willing to walk away if the deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm not yet willing to sell to John because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I'm still confident that this is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  I believe we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm happy with the offer and believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the limited time remaining."
