"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's ambitious:** It's not a ""lowball"" offer, and it shows that you're confident in the product's value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still comfortable selling the product for this price, even if Bob rejects the offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's still a significant amount of money, it's important to remember that Bob has a high perceived value for the product.  There's room for us to negotiate a better price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows him that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but not at a price that undervalues my product. 
* **It's still within my acceptable range:** I'm comfortable selling the product for this amount, and it's still significantly higher than John's offer.

By counteroffering at $850,000, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I won't settle for a price that's too low.  Let's see if this convinces him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $780,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, which means there's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $820,000. This price is a compromise that reflects my minimum while also demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal. It's still significantly higher than John's offer, and with Bob's high perceived value, I think this could be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Although I've been willing to negotiate, it's getting late in the game. I don't want to risk losing out entirely.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
