"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a bold opening, but I believe it gives me the best chance of maximizing profit. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's tempting to accept and close the deal quickly, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'll adjust my counteroffer to reflect the value I place on the product while staying within a reasonable range to potentially entice Bob to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and reflects the minimum value I'm willing to accept.  I believe this price is reasonable and might make Bob reconsider his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a slight increase from the previous round. I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. It's a strategic move to potentially entice Bob to meet me halfway.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, and I'm confident that further negotiation will lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator, and we're running out of rounds. While $980,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. To avoid risking a deal that's below my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
