"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, making it clear that Bob is serious about getting a better deal.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $15,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a reasonable price without risking a further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or even losing the product altogether."
