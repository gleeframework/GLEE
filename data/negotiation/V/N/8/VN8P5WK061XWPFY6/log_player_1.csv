{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $4,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price up or down depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still a decent profit, it's below your initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price point by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
