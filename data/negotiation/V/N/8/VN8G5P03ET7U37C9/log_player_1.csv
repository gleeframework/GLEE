This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, and we can work towards a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I can't accept anything below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I need.  I'll counteroffer again, but if he doesn't come up significantly, I'll sell to John."

I've reached my limit with Bob. While he's shown interest, his offers remain significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's time to move on. John is a reliable buyer who is happy to pay my asking price. It's a better deal for me, and I'm confident I can secure a more profitable sale with him."
