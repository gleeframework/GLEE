{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It's also a significant amount lower than Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of his acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay.  It's my minimum price, so I'll accept it and avoid any further risk of a lower offer or a lengthy negotiation."
