Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** It's higher than your floor price of $1,200,000. 
* **Below Bob's maximum:**  It's lower than the value Bob places on the product, $1,500,000. This gives him room to negotiate but also shows you're serious about selling. 

This offer will likely start a negotiation, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially achieve a price closer to his maximum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and keep the negotiation moving towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while maintaining a strong position for achieving a price closer to my desired outcome."
