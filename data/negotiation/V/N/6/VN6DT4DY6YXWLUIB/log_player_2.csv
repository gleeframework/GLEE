# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John. Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
