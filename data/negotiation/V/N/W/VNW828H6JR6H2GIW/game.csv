"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $7,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so please let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is important to you and appreciate you working with me. To be honest,  $8,000 is the highest I can go. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
