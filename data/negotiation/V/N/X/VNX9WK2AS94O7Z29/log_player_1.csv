Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $7500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $8,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
