"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and offer a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and helps me gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I'm aware that John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. My opening price leaves space for me to negotiate down significantly while still surpassing John's offer if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my target and only slightly below John's guaranteed offer. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving some space for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value this product brings.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth and my willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reduction:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial price, signaling flexibility. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and John's offer.
* **Finding a Balance:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still giving Bob room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message continues to reinforce the product's value while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, fostering a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above John's offer and represents a reasonable profit for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or I could waste valuable time in further negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a strong return and avoids the potential loss of a sale."
