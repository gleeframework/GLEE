Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob wants to negotiate slightly downwards. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the delay of going to John, even if John offers your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to secure a price that is beneficial for both you and Bob."
