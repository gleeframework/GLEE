"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $11,500 to $11,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice might not come down further, and he could end up paying John's price of $12,000.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without taking on unnecessary risk."
