"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely in the ballpark, but I'm looking to get a better price. Considering the value you've placed on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies in its unique features and potential returns. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still feeling a bit high at $875,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll counter with a price of $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",880000.0,Alice,5,
