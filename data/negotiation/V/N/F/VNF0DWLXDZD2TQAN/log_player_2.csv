"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but we can likely get a better deal. It's always good to try and negotiate, especially since we know we have an alternative option with John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies in its unique features and potential returns. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not convinced. We've got a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can get to my desired price of $850,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still feeling a bit high at $875,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 862500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll counter with a price of $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price but is still above it. However, we're already halfway through the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting at $880,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John."
