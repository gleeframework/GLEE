"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a good value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise. While I understand you're working with a budget, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still provides you with a substantial value, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
