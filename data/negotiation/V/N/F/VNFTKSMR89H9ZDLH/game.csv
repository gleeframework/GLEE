"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be of significant benefit to you. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that reflects its value while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price well below its true value.  I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding further. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,
