Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Open to counteroffers:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation process going. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't result in a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** While I can sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Next steps:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $115 to $105. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $105, as it's lower than his perceived value of $100.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still not willing to go below $105 as it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter again, but I'm setting a clear limit with my offer."
