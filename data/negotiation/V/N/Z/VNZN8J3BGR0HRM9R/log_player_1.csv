{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows for negotiation and leaves room for potential profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80 for this product. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer Bob and try to find a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
