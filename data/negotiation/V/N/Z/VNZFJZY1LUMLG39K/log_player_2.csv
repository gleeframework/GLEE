**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  While she might be willing to negotiate down a little further, it's not worth the risk of her digging in and the negotiations stalling. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is a significant saving compared to Alice's current offer."
