"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a fair starting point that allows for negotiation. I'm offering a price that is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This opens the door for potential counteroffers and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I have 9 rounds left and there's a good chance I can negotiate a better price. I'm also not in a desperate situation as I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd love to get more, I'm already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
