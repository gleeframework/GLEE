"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer. You can always buy from John for $120 as a backup."
