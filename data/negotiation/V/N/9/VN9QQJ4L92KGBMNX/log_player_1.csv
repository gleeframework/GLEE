Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets a price higher than John's offer, aiming to maximize profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a chance. If Bob values it higher than $12,000, he'll accept. Otherwise, I'll still secure a decent profit by selling to John."
