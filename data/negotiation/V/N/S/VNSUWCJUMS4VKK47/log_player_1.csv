Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $13,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is above my minimum threshold, I believe I can still get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $14,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my investment in it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not willing to go above $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $13,500, which is closer to my desired price and still above my minimum threshold of $12,000.  Given the limited rounds remaining, I'm choosing to accept this offer to secure the sale.  There's always a risk that if I continue to negotiate, Bob might change his mind or I might not be able to reach a better price.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy with the outcome."
