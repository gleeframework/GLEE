Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it provides significant value, even exceeding the price for you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your aim is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get more than $12,000, or he might accept the $11,000, which is still a profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to accept even if the price is above his initial perceived worth."
