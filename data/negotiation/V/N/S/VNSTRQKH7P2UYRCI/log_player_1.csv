Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can negotiate down towards $100 knowing John is your backup. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price."
