"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you at $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  This would still be a significant profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget constraints. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your willingness to compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,6,
