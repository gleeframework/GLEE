"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, so how about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great price for a product worth much more.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $100 is still significantly below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $120.  This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
