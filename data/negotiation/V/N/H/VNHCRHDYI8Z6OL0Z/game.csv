"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product that will undoubtedly bring you significant benefits.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,025,000? I'm confident this price reflects a win-win scenario for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $985,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that recognizes the value of the product.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but $985,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
