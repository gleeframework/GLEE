Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum I think Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to discussing the price, without explicitly stating that I'm willing to lower it. This keeps the negotiation dynamic and leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. I will also consider the time spent negotiating and whether I want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and sell to John instead."
