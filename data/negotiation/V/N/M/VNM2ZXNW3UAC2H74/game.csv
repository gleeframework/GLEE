"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I'm sure this price is still beneficial for you considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this represents a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial offer. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm prepared to consider $1,400,000 as my final offer.  This price point reflects the significant value this product holds while recognizing your interest.  Please let me know if this works for you, as I'm also evaluating other opportunities.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
