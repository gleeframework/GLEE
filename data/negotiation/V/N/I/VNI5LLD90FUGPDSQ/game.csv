"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let's make this deal happen!",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $130 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to go down to $132.  Let's try to close this deal.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $132 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $130.  I'm serious about buying, so let's try to make this work.",130.0,Bob,6,
