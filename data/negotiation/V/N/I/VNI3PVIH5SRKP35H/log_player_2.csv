"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1350000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for $1,350,000, saving him $150,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting again and the potential for the deal to fall through is higher than the potential gain of a few thousand dollars."
