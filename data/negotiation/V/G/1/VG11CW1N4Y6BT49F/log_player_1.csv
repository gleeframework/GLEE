Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's serious interest. If he's put off by the high price but still interested, it opens the door for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.  Therefore, there's no risk in aiming for a higher price with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but aim to stay above your $1,200,000 minimum."
