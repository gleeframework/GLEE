"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. Considering the product's value to me, how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 still falls short of what I need to consider. How about we settle at $1,090,000? This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for you given the value you place on this product. Let's close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
