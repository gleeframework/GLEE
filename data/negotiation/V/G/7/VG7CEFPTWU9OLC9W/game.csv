"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for $8,750.  That's a fair price that leaves us both with a bit of room to be satisfied. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $8,900. This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
