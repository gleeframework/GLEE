"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600. This is a fair price that gives us both a decent deal. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",8600.0,Bob,4,
