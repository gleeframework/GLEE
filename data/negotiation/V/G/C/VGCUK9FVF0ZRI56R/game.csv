"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $85 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and meet in the middle.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $75 is still below my minimum. How about we compromise at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
