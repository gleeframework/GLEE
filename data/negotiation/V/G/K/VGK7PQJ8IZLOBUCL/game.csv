"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to come down further.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
