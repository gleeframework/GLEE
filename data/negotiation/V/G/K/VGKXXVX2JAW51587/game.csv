"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the unique item, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in purchasing it for $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $150. Would you be interested in that price?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $130 for this unique item. Let's see if we can close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $145. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to move forward with John's offer.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $140 to be able to move forward. I can offer it to you for $142. This is getting close to my minimum, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",142.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $142 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $138. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",138.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $139. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",139.0,Alice,9,
