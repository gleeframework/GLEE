Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will accept the offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he rejects it. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his last offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not comfortable going lower, and I don't want to risk spending more time negotiating when I already have a guaranteed sale with John for $100."
