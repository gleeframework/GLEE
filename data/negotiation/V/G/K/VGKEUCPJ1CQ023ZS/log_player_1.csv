Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Since I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I'm offering the product to Bob for the same price I would sell it to John. This gives Bob the opportunity to get the product at a price he values it at, while still allowing me to maximize my profit.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
