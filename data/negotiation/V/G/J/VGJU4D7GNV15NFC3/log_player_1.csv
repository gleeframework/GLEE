Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **The message** is friendly and invites Bob to engage in further conversation. 

I'm starting with a higher price point to see if I can get closer to my target. I am prepared to negotiate, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also well below the value I place on the product. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value of the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum.
* My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my original offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* The message is polite and reiterates the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I've already lowered my price twice, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I value the product at $1,500,000 and John is willing to pay that, so I'm better off selling to John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, who seems to be stubbornly sticking to his price point."
