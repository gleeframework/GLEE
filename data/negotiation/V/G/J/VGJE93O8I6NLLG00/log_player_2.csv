"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is closer to my limit than Alice's initial value, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a price closer to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it.

Alice is negotiating, but $11,000 is still above my ideal price. I'm willing to risk it going a bit higher to see if I can get closer to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice seems firm on staying above $11,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'd rather secure the product from John at my target price."
