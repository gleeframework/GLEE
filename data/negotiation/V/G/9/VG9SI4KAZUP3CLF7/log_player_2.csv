"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is more than your maximum budget of $150.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always fall back to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's $120, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves space for Alice to counter back with a price closer to her value of $80, while still allowing you to save money.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** This counteroffer is a good balance between trying to get a low price and not risking losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $110 is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target of $150.
* **More room for negotiation:** You've only had 3 rounds, and there are 7 more to go.  
* **John's price is a backup:** You can always buy from John if you can't get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** A counteroffer of $105 is a modest increase from your previous offer, showing you're serious about buying while also trying to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Staying within your budget:** This price is still below your maximum of $150.
* **Testing the waters:** This allows you to see if Alice is willing to budge closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $108 is just slightly above your target of $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** You've only had 5 rounds, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further."
