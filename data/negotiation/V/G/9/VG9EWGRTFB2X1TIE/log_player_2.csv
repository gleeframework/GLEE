"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth at least $1000000 to you.  I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value you'll gain.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a ""discount"" from the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and go with John, who is willing to sell for your maximum price."
