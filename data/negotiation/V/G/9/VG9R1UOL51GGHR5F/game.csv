"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000. Can you consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal happen. This price still reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from $900,000, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000. How about $775,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours.  Let's agree on $812,500. This price reflects the value of the product and shows my commitment to making this deal happen.  Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $785,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my offer?",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is my minimum. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further delays.",800000.0,Alice,7,
