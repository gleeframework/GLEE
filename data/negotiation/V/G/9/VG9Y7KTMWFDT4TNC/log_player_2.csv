"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. It's important to start significantly lower than your true maximum price to allow room for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too high. We'll counter and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $70? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're slowly moving towards our target price. Hopefully, Alice will be receptive to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're so close to our limit, but going over isn't an option. Let's see if Alice is willing to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close to a price I'd be happy with.  How about we split the difference and call it $77.50?"",
""product_price"": 77.50
}
``` 

This is a bit of a risky move as it's above our absolute limit, but it shows Alice we're serious while still aiming for a decent discount. If she rejects it, we'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I think I can do a bit better. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower and we're already pushing our limit. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
