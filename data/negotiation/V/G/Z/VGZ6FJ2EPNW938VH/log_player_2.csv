# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a great deal for you considering the value, and it gets us closer to a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While $100 is significantly less than what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to go down to $120 as a final compromise.  If you're serious about buying, let me know if you can meet me there.
