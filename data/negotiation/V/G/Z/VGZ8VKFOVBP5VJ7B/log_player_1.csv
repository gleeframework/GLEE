Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes the product's value at even slightly more than $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's perspective. This encourages a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one."
