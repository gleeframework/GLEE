"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This allows for some negotiation room and gives me a good starting point. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's important to start high and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. Bob is willing to pay at least that amount, so I'm not at risk of getting nothing. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum price and leaves room for potential further negotiation.  I'm aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has increased his offer slightly, but it's still below my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer. I'm also considering the limited number of rounds, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again lowering my price, but only slightly, showing flexibility while staying firm. I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price.  Since Bob is willing to go up a bit, I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,500, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer is a decent improvement over his previous one, and it's only $250 less than my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal altogether. There's also a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob won't counter again and I'll be forced to sell to John for $10,000."
