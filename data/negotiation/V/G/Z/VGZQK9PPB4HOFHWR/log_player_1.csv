I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still allows me to earn a decent profit while offering Bob a good deal. 

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Bob's Value:**  I know Bob values the product at $8,000. My offer is significantly higher than that, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **My Floor:**  I have a fallback option with John who will pay $15,000. This gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob, knowing I can still get my desired price elsewhere.

While I could offer a higher price, I'm aiming for a deal that both benefits Bob and allows me to get a good price."
