Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $900,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, attempting to get a higher price from Bob is strategic. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $900,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He saves $100,000 compared to its value to him, and I make a profit above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
