"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely get an even better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob money and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
