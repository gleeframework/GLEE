"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach our target price before we run out of rounds. John's offer of $800,000 is our upper limit, and it makes more sense to secure that deal now rather than risk Alice not going low enough."
