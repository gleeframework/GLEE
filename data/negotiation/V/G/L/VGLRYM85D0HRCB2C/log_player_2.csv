# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential returns. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000.

This product fits into a specific need for me, and anything above $800,000 just won't work.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away at this point.  If you're willing to come down to $750,000 we might be able to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $850,000 is a substantial offer. However, to be completely transparent, that price point requires me to make a considerable compromise.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. Alice has indicated that $1,100,000 is her bottom line, and that's still significantly higher than your absolute maximum budget of $800,000.  John offers a guaranteed way to acquire the product within your budget, even if it means missing out on a potentially lower price from Alice."
