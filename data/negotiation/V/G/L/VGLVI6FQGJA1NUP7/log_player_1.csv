Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $650,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could meet you at $700,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $800,000 threshold I need within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
