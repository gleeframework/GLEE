Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you want to start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair reflection,"" you subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts leaves space for potential counter-offers while still conveying confidence in the product's worth. 
 
This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective as a potential buyer."
