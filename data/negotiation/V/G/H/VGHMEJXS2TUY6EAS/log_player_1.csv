Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm also including a friendly message to create a good rapport and encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for more. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000 by countering Bob's offer. It's important to try to maximize my profit, and I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I'm confident this price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $14,000 target, $12,500 is a solid price considering Bob's perceived value of $15,000. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good profit while avoiding the risk of him walking away completely or having to settle with John's $10,000 offer.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with the potential for loss in a negotiation."
