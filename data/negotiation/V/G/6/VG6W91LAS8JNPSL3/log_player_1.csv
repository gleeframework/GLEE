Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high price ($18,000), we set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it makes subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **One-shot offer:**  This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob knows this is his only chance to get the product at this price.
* **Backup option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring we don't lose out completely if Bob rejects the offer.

**Potential Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Best-case scenario, we significantly exceed our minimum price.
* **Bob rejects:** We sell to John for our minimum acceptable price. 

While there's a risk Bob might be completely turned off by the high initial price, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
