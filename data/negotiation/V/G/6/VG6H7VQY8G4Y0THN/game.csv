"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I'm willing to make a compromise to get the product, but I need to stay within my means.",10250.0,Bob,4,
