"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $150, and I'm willing to make a slight profit. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you being willing to work with me. While the product is interesting, $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $150 for it. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little too high for me.  How about $160?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work!",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go down to $160. I'm willing to offer it to you for $162.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",162.5,Alice,5,
