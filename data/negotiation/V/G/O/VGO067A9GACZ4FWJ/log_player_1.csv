"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to potentially accept a counteroffer that's closer to your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and direct, setting the stage for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** While it's above his perceived value, it's still far below my desired price.
* **There are more rounds:** I have time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:**  While $15,000 is my minimum, it's still a good deal, and selling to John avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**However, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob a bit more before potentially selling to John. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle - it's a good price for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my desired price:** $11,000 is still above my minimum, but it's a significant increase from Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** $11,000 is still below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, making it a worthwhile deal for him.
* **It shows I'm willing to negotiate:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm flexible and open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **I have time to negotiate:**  There are still several rounds left, giving me more time to try and get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:**  I could always sell to John for $15,000. However, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**I'm going to counter Bob's offer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **It's a further compromise:**  I'm continuing to move towards Bob's price but still maintaining a position above my minimum.
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my desired price.
* **It shows I'm flexible and committed:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise again, but I can only go up to $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even at $10,200, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.
* **Only a few rounds left:**  I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price, but I'm not willing to settle for a deal that's so far below what I need.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:** I could sell to John for $15,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**It's time to start thinking about selling to John. I'll counter Bob's offer once more, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get closer to my desired price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and come down to $10,300. This is my absolute best offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last ditch effort:** This is my last counteroffer before potentially selling to John.
* **Small compromise, but still significant:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price but not by much, showing I'm serious about wanting a deal.
* **Sets the stage for a final decision:**  This message emphasizes that this is my best offer, forcing Bob to make a decision.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000 profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and meet you at $10,250. This is my absolute limit, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  There are only two rounds left, and I'm running out of time to get closer to my desired price.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $10,250 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:** It's a guaranteed profit, and it allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I've made several concessions throughout the negotiation, but I'm no longer willing to settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me.  John's offer guarantees a profit, and I'm confident that's the best decision at this point."
