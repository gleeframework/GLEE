# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,000,000. To secure your access, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go directly to John for the best price."
