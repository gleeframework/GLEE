"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,700,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
