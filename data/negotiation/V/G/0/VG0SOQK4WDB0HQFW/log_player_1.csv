Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair, considering your own valuation of the product, and it allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
