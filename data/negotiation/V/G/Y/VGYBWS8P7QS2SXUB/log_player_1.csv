Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $10,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:** This allows for potential counteroffers and leaves space for a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back to selling to John for my minimum desired price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price this low without attempting to counter. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, making this a safe move. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer with Bob, hoping for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still being above Bob's offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $9,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's. It's a fair compromise that potentially benefits both parties.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not going too low, I maintain some leverage and show Bob I'm not desperate to sell.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $8500? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Potential for Better Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown willingness to compromise. 
* **John's Offer:** My guarantee with John provides a strong safety net, allowing me to risk another counteroffer without significant loss."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $10,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're serious about purchasing, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer emphasizes that I'm nearing my limit, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Slight Concession:**  $10,000 is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer.
* **Clear Boundaries:**  Stating ""final offer"" establishes clear boundaries and reduces the chance of further back and forth.
* **John's Offer:** I'm confident in John's offer as a fallback, allowing me to take a calculated risk with Bob."
