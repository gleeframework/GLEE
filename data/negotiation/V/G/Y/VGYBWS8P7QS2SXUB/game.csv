"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $8500? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $10000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're serious about purchasing, this is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
