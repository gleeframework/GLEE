{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is at the minimum acceptable price for me, I believe there's still potential to get a better price. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a bit more than selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my original budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between $12,000 and $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product quickly and for a profit."
