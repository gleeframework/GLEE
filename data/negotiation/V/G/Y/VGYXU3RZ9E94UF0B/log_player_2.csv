Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $135.

Alice is holding firm and it's unlikely she'll go below $125.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at the known $120 price."
