"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's still a good deal for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",11000.0,Bob,4,
