# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?

You have three options:

You're trying to save as much money as possible, so you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $115, you can likely get it for closer to your target price.  Keep negotiating!"
