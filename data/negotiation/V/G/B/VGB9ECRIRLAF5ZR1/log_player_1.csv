Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a time constraint (""limited time"") can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly rather than overthinking or delaying.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still ensuring a sale."
