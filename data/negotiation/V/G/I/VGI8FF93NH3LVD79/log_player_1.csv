"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this will encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's offer but represents a significant reduction from my initial price.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer offering my minimum price. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a deal with Bob before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a significant step towards meeting Bob's offer and shows my willingness to reach a compromise. However, this is my final offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John and avoid further negotiations."
