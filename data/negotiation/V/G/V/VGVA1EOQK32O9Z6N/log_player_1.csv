Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($120), giving me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Not too aggressive:** $100 is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer while leaving space for counteroffers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $90 is only $10 below my starting offer and well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll lower his offer further, or I might end up selling to John for $80. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiation."
