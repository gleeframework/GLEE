"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth might vary. I am offering it to you for $95, which includes the cost of production and a small margin for myself. I believe this is a fair price considering its quality and potential benefits to you. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in purchasing if you're willing to come down to $85.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
