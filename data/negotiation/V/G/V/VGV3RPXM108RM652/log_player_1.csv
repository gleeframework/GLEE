I am offering it to you for $95, which includes the cost of production and a small margin for myself. I believe this is a fair price considering its quality and potential benefits to you. Would you be interested in discussing this further?"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in purchasing if you're willing to come down to $85.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
