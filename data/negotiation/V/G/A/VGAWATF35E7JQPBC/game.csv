"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product goes beyond a simple assessment.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This offer takes into account its unique potential while recognizing your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I believe this product has the potential to exceed your expectations.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $900,000, hoping this reflects a fair compromise that allows us to finalize the deal.  I believe this price is reasonable given the value it holds for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
