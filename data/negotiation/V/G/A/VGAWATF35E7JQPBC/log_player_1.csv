Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,500,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows us to both benefit from this transaction.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $900,000, hoping this reflects a fair compromise that allows us to finalize the deal.  I believe this price is reasonable given the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,000,000 minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
