Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its value to you. I'm confident you'll see the incredible potential it holds.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is tailored to Bob's known value of the product ($1,000,000).  It highlights the product's worth to Alice, but focuses on a potential deal that would still be profitable for Bob.  The offer of a negotiation (""Let's discuss a price..."") encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Product Price:**  $1,250,000 is a middle ground between Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives Bob a significant discount while still ensuring a good profit for Alice.

**Why this approach is effective:**

* **Negotiation:** It opens the door for negotiation, allowing Alice to potentially increase the price further.
* **Appeal to Bob's interests:**  The message focuses on the value proposition for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Safeguard:** Alice has a backup buyer (John) willing to pay her full asking price, so she's not pressured to accept a low offer."
