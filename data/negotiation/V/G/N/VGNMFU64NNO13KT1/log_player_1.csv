Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
