{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know is quite valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $8,000 (to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price between Bob's valuation and your minimum allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $13,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your fallback option (selling to John)."
