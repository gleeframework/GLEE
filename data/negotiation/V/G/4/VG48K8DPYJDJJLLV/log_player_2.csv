"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling flexible, but $8,500 is the lowest I can go right now. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unwilling to go below your maximum price. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
