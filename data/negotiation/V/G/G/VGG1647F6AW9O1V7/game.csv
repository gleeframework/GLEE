"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
