Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:

``` 

Alice is very consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable negotiation tactic. However, she's not going to go below $8,000 and at this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John than risk Alice not budging further."
