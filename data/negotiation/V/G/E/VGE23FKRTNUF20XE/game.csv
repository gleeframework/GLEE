"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $9,000. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle at $9,200? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $9,000? I think we can get a good deal done at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
