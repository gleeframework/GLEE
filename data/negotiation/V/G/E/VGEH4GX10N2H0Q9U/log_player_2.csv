"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to get a good price and you get a product that's worth more to you than the asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay for the product from John ($12,500 vs $15,000).** This means you save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **While Alice claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, this is irrelevant to your decision.** You have a hard limit of $15,000, and anything lower is a win."
