Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, making it potentially enticing for him.
* **Below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.

This strategy balances getting a good price with potentially closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my target while still maintaining some negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to keep costs down.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still looking to keep my expenses lower. Could we agree on $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum, and I've already made a counteroffer.  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be drawn out and might not result in a higher price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees my minimum and avoids the risk of a lower sale price or a protracted negotiation."
