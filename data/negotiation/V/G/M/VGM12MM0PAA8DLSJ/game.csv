"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. I understand you have budget considerations, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can manage. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see value in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
