"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to start high, we also want to stay within a reasonable range.  A price of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but gives us room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's potential and inviting Bob's input. This approach aims to foster a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we have room to negotiate. Bob's offer being significantly lower than his stated value of $1,500,000 suggests he's willing to go higher. We'll counter with a price closer to our starting point to try and secure a more advantageous deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I understand you have budget considerations, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** We're signaling to Bob that we're not willing to drastically drop the price. The drop from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000 shows flexibility but keeps us above his initial offer.
* **Justification:** We're not just stating a number, we're justifying it by acknowledging Bob's constraints while reiterating that his offer is too low.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The phrasing ""meet somewhere in the middle"" encourages a collaborative approach and suggests a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can manage. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see value in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding our minimum price by $300,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating genuine interest and reaching a price point that's very favorable for us.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob walking away or our offers becoming too far apart. Accepting now secures a great deal without risking the loss of the sale."
