"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
