"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  This would allow us both to make a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
