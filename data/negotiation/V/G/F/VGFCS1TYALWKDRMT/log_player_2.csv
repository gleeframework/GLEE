"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Alice's offer and his maximum budget. This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while still showing his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $950,000?  This would allow us both to make a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price.  He has a few rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. The message also emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, hoping to persuade Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and let us close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has a few rounds left.  He should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. He is still pushing for a lower price, but he is also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. By offering $910,000, he is showing Alice that he is serious about closing the deal, while still remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $915,000.  This is a fair compromise and I think it's a good price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $915,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's nearing his limit on rounds and the price is still a bit higher than he'd like.  At this point, Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000.  It's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Bob is only a few rounds away from being forced to accept a higher price if he runs out of time."
