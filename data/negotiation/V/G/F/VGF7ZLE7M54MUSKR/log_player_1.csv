"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and see if it's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to get closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a significant profit, but I've lowered my price to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is a good compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  If he accepts, great. If not, I'll reassess the situation and make a decision based on the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,100,000.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping Bob will come closer to my desired price.  If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession here, lowering my price to $1,400,000.  This is a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground quickly.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my target.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm taking a big risk here, as I'm getting very close to my minimum price.  However, I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to compromise and accept.  If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum price, and I only have two rounds left.  While I could make another counteroffer, the risk of Bob rejecting it is high, and I might end up with nothing. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the safest option at this point. It guarantees a significant profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
