"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This price allows us both to secure a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
