"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This sets a high reference point for subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The inflated price allows me to make concessions during the negotiation while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception and make him more willing to negotiate within a higher price range. 

This strategy is about maximizing my potential gain while staying aware that Bob might counter with a much lower offer. I'm prepared to negotiate downwards, but I'm also keeping John's guaranteed offer in mind as a potential alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount this early in the process. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** By not immediately accepting a lower price, I reinforce that the product is valuable and worth negotiating for. 
* **Guide the Negotiation:** I can use my counteroffer to steer the price closer to my desired range.

I'm aware that John's offer is a safety net, but I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I think this price fairly reflects the unique advantages it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $150,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm maintaining a price point well above his offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, aiming to shift his focus away from his initial lower offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My counteroffer still leaves some room for further negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal in subsequent rounds.

By making a significant concession but holding firm above my minimum, I'm aiming to signal my seriousness while still incentivizing Bob to continue negotiating towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,150,000. I still think the product is a bit overpriced, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might be firm on his valuation, and further negotiation could lead to a deadlock. 
* **Losing the Deal:**  There's a chance Bob could walk away if he feels pressured, leaving me with John's offer as the only alternative.

Accepting this offer represents a strong profit margin and eliminates the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
