Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $99. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is a good starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, getting you closer to your $100 goal."
