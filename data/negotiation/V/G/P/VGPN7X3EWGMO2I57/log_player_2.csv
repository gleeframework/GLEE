Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you the product for $7,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating that she's unwilling to go much lower.  While we could push for a slightly better price, there's a risk she'll become frustrated and break off negotiations. $7,300 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $2,700 off John's price and securing the product."
