"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $7,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to accept $6,800 for the product?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,200 is very close to my limit, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $7,000? That would seal the deal for me.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you the product for $7,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",7300.0,Alice,7,
