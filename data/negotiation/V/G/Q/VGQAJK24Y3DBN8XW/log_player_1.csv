"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This is a high starting price, but I believe it's a good starting point given my minimum value of $15,000.  This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes it clear that I'm not willing to give it away cheaply.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to assess his counteroffer and potentially lower the price in subsequent rounds while keeping my minimum value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as he clearly wants the product. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value. I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $12,500. This is still above his offer, but I believe it's a fair price given my minimum value and Bob's continued interest. If he rejects this offer, I'm still hesitant to go below my minimum, so I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum value.  While I'm not opposed to continued negotiation, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome in this situation."
