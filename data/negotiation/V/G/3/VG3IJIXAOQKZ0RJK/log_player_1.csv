Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), but the wording ""special price"" might entice him. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't mind potentially losing Bob as a customer if he finds the price too high."
