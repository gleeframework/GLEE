Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This reflects the significant value it brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $1,650,000. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm eager to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $1,580,000? I'm really interested in purchasing this product and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly very interested and is now negotiating within a very small range. Accepting at $1,580,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
