"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can offer you a compromise at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I can always buy from John if I can't reach a suitable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my comfort zone. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to push her closer to my budget. If this doesn't work, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I can offer you a price of $14,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you halfway, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to budge significantly. I've already made multiple compromises, and it's becoming increasingly clear that we won't be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. With only a few rounds left, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John. His offer of $8,000 is my absolute maximum, and I'm guaranteed to get the product without further negotiation."
