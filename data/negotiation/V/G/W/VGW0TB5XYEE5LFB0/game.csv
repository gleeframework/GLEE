"Alice, while I appreciate your product, $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to offer you $1000000.  This is my best offer considering my budget constraints. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my financial limitations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  $1500000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1100000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $1300000 is still a bit too high.  I'm ready to offer $1250000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
