"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $820,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  which still leaves you with a significant profit margin. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to getting a fair deal, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, and I think that's a good compromise that benefits us both.  Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
