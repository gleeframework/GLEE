"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $180 is more than his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit out of my budget. How about $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He is still willing to pay less than $150, and he has rounds to go.  It's worth trying to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $165 is still a bit too high. Would you consider $145? I'm really hoping to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. How about we meet at $157.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, $157.50 is still over his budget. It's likely that the negotiations will continue to drag on and Bob risks wasting valuable rounds.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $150."
