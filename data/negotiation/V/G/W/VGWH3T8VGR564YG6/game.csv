"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,750. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
