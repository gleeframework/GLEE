Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, while still securing a good profit margin.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it for a price too close to $100 might make Bob balk.  This price point makes it clear it's a good deal compared to his perceived value."
