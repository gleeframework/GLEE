"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15500? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13750 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $14250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer: $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiations so far. I'm willing to walk away if this doesn't work out.",13500.0,Bob,8,
