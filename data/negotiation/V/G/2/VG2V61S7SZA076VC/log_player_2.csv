Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still a significant gap from my initial assessment.  This product has unique advantages that justify a higher price point.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still too high.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and the current market conditions.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
