"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $12,250 to make this deal worthwhile.  What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,5,
