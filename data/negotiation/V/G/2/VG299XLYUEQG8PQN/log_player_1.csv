Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing might encourage Bob to act quickly, especially if he believes the product is highly valuable.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential to gain an extra $400,000 makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
