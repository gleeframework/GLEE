"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity, hoping to create a positive atmosphere.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm asking for his thoughts, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I still have time and rounds left. I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **Potential to Close the Gap:**  While Bob's initial offer is far too low, it shows his interest. There's potential to negotiate closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I want to remain firm on my minimum price but also incentivize Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $800,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm on my minimum price of $1,000,000. This is critical to ensure I meet my own financial goals. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price allows for a win-win scenario. This can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy if needed. If he still refuses, I'll consider making a slightly lower counteroffer, but only if it's necessary to avoid selling to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** While $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Bob is showing increasing willingness to negotiate, and I want to continue leveraging that momentum to secure a higher price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With more rounds remaining, there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John would guarantee a profit, but I'm aiming for a higher return.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer that acknowledges Bob's improved offer but emphasizes that I still need to reach a price closer to my target. I'll consider a counteroffer slightly higher than $920,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $920,000 is a good offer, and shows you're serious about this. To make this work for me, I need to come closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $975,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's improved offer and express my appreciation. 
* **Compromise and Justification:** I propose a counteroffer that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. I justify the price by highlighting its fairness for both of us.
* **Focus on Closing:**  I emphasize the desire to reach a deal, making it clear that I am serious about closing the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh my options:

* **Slight Lower Counteroffer:**  If I'm confident in my negotiating position, I might consider a slightly lower counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:** If there's a high risk of the deal failing, I might consider selling to John. This would guarantee a profit but would not maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $940000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  $940,000 is closer to my goal, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Bob's offer shows continued progress. He's willing to pay more, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee a profit, I want to maximize my earnings.  I'm optimistic that I can get a better price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that balances my desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal. I'll consider a counteroffer slightly higher than $940,000, keeping in mind the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close!  Your offer of $940,000 shows you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $960,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Momentum:** I acknowledge Bob's improved offer and emphasize that we are close to a deal.
* **Final Compromise:** I propose a counteroffer that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. This price is closer to my desired range but still within a reasonable margin for Bob.
* **Urgency and Finality:** I emphasize the need to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I'll finalize the deal and celebrate securing a good price!
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll have two rounds left.  If I believe there's still a chance to reach a deal, I'll consider making another counteroffer. If not, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $960000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $930000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds left, the time for negotiation is running out.
* **Small Gap:**  The remaining gap between our desired prices is small, but still significant. It's unlikely that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in two rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and meets my financial goals. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to maximize my earnings with Bob, the remaining rounds are limited, and the price gap is small.  Selling to John is the most logical decision to ensure a guaranteed profit."
