"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still gives you a significant value proposition, and allows me to earn a fair price. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1300000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price.  I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! $1250000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
