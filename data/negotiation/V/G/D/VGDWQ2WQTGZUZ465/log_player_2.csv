Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still gives you a significant value proposition, and allows me to earn a fair price. What do you say?

I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
