"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, slightly higher than my minimum ($100) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation.  By starting slightly higher, I leave myself room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, so I'm not stuck in a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation. I'm hoping to either get Bob to increase his offer or at least meet my minimum price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation process with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more for this product. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that's both appealing to Bob and still profitable for me.  This approach aims to find a mutually agreeable solution, while keeping the door open to selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $92.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not entirely satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for improvement, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired range.  I'm aware that selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation process with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $93.75?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $93.75, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($92.50). This shows I'm actively trying to reach a compromise.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""closing the deal"" to make the offer more appealing and create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a final negotiation round that brings us closer to an agreement. I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while still remaining above my minimum threshold. If this offer is rejected, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $100, I'm now at a point where continuing negotiations with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob outweighs the potential benefit of further negotiation."
