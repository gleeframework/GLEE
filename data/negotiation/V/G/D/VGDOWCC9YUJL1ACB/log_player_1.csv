Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer, along with the offer itself:

**Reasoning**

* **Guaranteed Sale:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 to John. This is her ""backup"" and ensures she never loses money.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Alice needs to offer a price lower than this for Bob to accept.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible without going over, as this maximizes her potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I offer it to anyone else. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  Are you interested in acquiring it for $1,190,000?"", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Appealing:** The message is direct, highlighting the exclusivity Bob is being offered.
* **Strategic Price:** Offering the product for $1,190,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $10,000 if he chooses to use/resell it. This makes the offer very tempting while still maximizing Alice's potential earnings. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a small amount of room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's very eager.

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob tries to negotiate a price lower than $1,190,000. She has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, so there's no need to settle for less from Bob."
