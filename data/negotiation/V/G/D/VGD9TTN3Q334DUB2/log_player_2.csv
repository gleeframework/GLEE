# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a better price.  You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so you have a good baseline for your counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but you're still closer to your goal of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you know John is a reliable option if this doesn't work out."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and while you could potentially keep negotiating,  the difference between $1,080,000 and your baseline of $1,000,000 is small enough to justify accepting this offer. You're still saving $20,000 compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
