"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share that I'm selling a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within your budget, there's room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product looks promising, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. $950,000 is still a reasonable offer for Bob, as it leaves him a significant profit margin.  This move puts pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, and doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product and its potential to benefit your business. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price point. You want to maximize your savings, and rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,000,000. This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about making a deal but still wants to save as much money as possible.  The offer is closer to Alice's last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.  This move puts the pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or make a final counteroffer to close the deal."
