This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for potential bargaining.  It also includes a positive and encouraging message to keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $9,000, it's a good deal for me and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  I'll take it."
