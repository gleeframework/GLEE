"I'm really interested in the product, but $750000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $675000?",675000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $675000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $675000. I'm offering the product to you for $712500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",712500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $712500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $687500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",687500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $687500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is already a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. Let me know if $700000 is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $700000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $690000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",690000.0,Bob,6,
