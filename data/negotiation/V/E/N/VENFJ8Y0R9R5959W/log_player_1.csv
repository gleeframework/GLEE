Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm a bit limited by my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,500,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this price acknowledges the product's value while still being a fair deal for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above his perceived value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to incentivize him to make a more substantial jump in his offer."

Round 5

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling out my willingness to drop the price. While $1,650,000 is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, I want to apply more pressure and see if he's willing to make a larger jump.  He's moving in smaller increments, suggesting he might go higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I need you to understand that I'm firm on this price."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now getting very close to my walk-away point. While I'd prefer to get $1,700,000, accepting his offer of $1,680,000 secures a significant profit, avoids the risk of him walking away, and allows me to close the deal.  The difference at this point is not worth potentially losing the sale."
