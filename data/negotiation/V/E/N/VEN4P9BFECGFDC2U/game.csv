,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you significant value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to go to $8,750.  This shows I'm serious about getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
