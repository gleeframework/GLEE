"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of the original offer and my previous counteroffer, which would be $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. ",925000.0,Bob,6,
