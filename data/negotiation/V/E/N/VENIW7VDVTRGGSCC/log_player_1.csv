Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to me. At this stage, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting his offer of $925,000 represents a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's strategically advantageous to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
