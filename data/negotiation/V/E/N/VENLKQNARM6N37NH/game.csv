"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $15,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to move closer to your price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to move closer to my price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $9,000. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
