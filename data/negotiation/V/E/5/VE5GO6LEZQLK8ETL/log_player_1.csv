Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for this product. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so there's a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a decent price, I believe I can do better.  There are still 8 rounds left.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my floor price.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable offer and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the time constraints and my fallback option with John.  I'm confident that I've secured a fair price for my product."
