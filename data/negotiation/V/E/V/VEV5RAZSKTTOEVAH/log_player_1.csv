Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
