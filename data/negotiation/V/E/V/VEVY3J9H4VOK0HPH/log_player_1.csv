"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum threshold. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum threshold, and I'm happy to accept it. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
