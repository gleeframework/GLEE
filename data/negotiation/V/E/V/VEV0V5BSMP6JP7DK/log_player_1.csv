Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a price that benefits both of you. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  This price shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but it's not so high that it immediately turns him off. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price point. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your minimum goal. 
* **Offers a compromise:**  $11,000 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** It encourages Bob to respond and hopefully reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below your ideal price point.  You've already negotiated with Bob, and it's clear he's not willing to go much higher.  It's time to cut your losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
