Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm offering it at a competitive price of $1,400,000. Given its potential to enhance your business, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target the High End of the ZOPA:** The $1,400,000 price aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:** The message focuses on the benefits to Bob's business,  justifying the price. 
* **Confidence, Not Desperation:** The tone is confident and suggests this is a fair deal, not a desperate attempt to sell.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer could be considered.
