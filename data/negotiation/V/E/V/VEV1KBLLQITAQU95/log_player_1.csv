"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'd accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from here.
