Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $12,000 and I'm happy with a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and $10,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is likely to see this as a fair price since it's below his estimated value of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have space to adjust the price without losing too much.

This strategy aims to find a mutually beneficial price quickly while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
