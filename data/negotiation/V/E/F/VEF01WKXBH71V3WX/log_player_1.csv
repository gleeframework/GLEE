Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $870,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle at $890,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I am willing to consider $890,000, but I would like to suggest $885,000 as a compromise. This price still aligns with my assessment of the product's value and moves us closer to your offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

At this point, Bob is very close to Alice's desired price. Accepting the $885,000 offer secures a significant profit above her minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation falling through entirely."
