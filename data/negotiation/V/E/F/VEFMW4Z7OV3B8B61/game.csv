"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product for you is significant. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
