"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $13,000 is still a significant price. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room for a lower price since Alice values the product at $8,000.
* **No need to rush.** You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product for you is significant. How about we settle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $11,500 is still above your ideal price point.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have room to push for a lower price.
* **No need to rush.** You have several rounds left and can still buy from John as a backup plan."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  That seems fair to both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
