"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $8,500 for the product. This still leaves some room for you to benefit from this purchase. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you to make a profit.  Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a win-win at that price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
