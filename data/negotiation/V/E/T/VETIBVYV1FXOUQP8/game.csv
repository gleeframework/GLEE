"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product. ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
