"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle of that, so how about $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8000. I'm willing to pay $7900, which is just $100 less than your minimum. Can you meet me at this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
