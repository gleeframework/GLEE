"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1250000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1350000. However, my budget is still tight. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, which is closer to my limit and still a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
