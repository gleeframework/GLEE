"Alice,  $22,000 is far too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $22,000 is still quite a ways off from what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see its true value once you start using it.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but I'm still only able to offer $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
