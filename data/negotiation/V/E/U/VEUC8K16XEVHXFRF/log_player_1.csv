Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will provide you with significant returns. I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows he might be willing to pay a premium for something that's valuable to him. Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still aims for a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics. This creates intrigue and suggests the price is justified.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, she can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer. If Bob counter-offers, it opens the door for negotiation."
