You can do better than $115.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's finalize this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You're still closer to your goal price of $100. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going to John."
