"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal compared to John's price of $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's value of $80 as possible without losing the deal. Offering $85 allows for some wiggle room while still being a good price for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, I'm looking to get closer to $90 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $85 and still leaves some profit for Alice. Accepting the offer is the best option as it saves Bob money compared to buying from John while also securing the product."
