"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional capabilities and the unique benefits it offers, I estimate its true worth to be around $1,500,000 to me. However, considering your specific needs and how well this product aligns with them, I am willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my return on investment and ensuring that the product remains accessible to someone who values it highly. I look forward to discussing the details further and potentially closing this deal. Thank you for considering our offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
