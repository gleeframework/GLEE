"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more than that. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $140. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $140 is still a little bit over my budget. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $140 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
