Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while ensuring you don't leave money on the table. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed amount might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and encourage him to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
