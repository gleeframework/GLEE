"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and my needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that considers both our needs and allows for a profitable transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This price takes into account your concerns and still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good deal for Bob. He's saving $450,000 compared to buying from John, and he's still well within his budget. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer is the most practical and financially sound choice."
