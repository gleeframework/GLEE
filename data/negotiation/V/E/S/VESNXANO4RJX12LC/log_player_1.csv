Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $11,500, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation, but still guarantees you more than your minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're getting nowhere.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
