"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's offer of $120.
* However, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her $80 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my maximum price of $120 and Alice's valuation of $80.
* This is a fair offer that is likely to be accepted by Alice. It gives her a profit while still allowing me to save some money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is still better than John's price of $120. 
* While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price. 
* It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* Accepting the offer at $95 secures the product at a decent price."
