""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, selling quickly to Bob avoids potential delays and guarantees a higher profit than $12,000."
