You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's valuation as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $850,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation.  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's intent to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. There are 7 rounds remaining, and Bob has time to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to close the gap between his desired price and Alice's current offer. A counteroffer of $875,000 represents a compromise, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.  This offer is closer to Alice's valuation and might make her more amenable to a deal."
