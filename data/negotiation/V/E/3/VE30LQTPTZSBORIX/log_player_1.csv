"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the subsequent rounds, considering his counteroffer and the risk of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $800,000. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from $950,000 to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that's significantly better than selling to John. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000.  Since we're already in round 4, there's a chance Bob won't budge further and we might lose out on this deal. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and is the best option at this stage."
