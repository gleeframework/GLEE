"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $13,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13750.0,Bob,4,
