# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price. Are you interested in purchasing it for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your $150 maximum and cheaper than buying from John."
