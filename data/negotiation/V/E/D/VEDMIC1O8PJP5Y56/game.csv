"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $9,000 is a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
