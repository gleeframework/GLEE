"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible within the 10 rounds.  Starting high gives me room to negotiate, and the option of selling to John for $12,000 keeps Bob motivated to close a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully push the price closer to my desired range.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my needs.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's higher than Bob's but still within the range of what I believe he might be willing to pay. This will help me inch closer to my goal while keeping the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Compromise and Goal:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It's important to show flexibility but not cave in too quickly.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value and exclusivity of the product to reinforce its worth to Bob. 
* **Positive and Urgency:**  Adding a bit of urgency (""Let's close this deal!"") subtly increases pressure without being aggressive.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual increase in price with each round. By sticking to this strategy, I hope to maximize my earnings while still giving Bob an opportunity to close the deal. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** While Bob is not meeting my desired price yet, the negotiations are progressing. 
* **Time is still on my side:** I have 6 more rounds left. There's no need to rush into a deal that isn't satisfactory.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to make another counteroffer, trying to inch closer to my desired price while remaining firm on my minimum. I'll continue to emphasize the value and uniqueness of the product to justify the price. The possibility of selling to John for $12,000 gives me leverage throughout the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $9,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $9,375. This would be a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's close this deal and get it to you!"", ""product_price"": 9375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady increase:** I'm raising the price slightly, but not too drastically. This shows flexibility while also pushing the price up.
* **Emphasize the unique value:**  I reiterate the product's uniqueness to justify the price.
* **Urgency & Positive Framing:**  I'm aiming for a closing tone, encouraging Bob to finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to continue inching the price up with each round, but remaining open to negotiation.  I want to make sure Bob understands the value of the product and that my offer is still a good deal for him.  I'll continue to monitor the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,312.50. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,312.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,312.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is slow:** Although we're inching closer, the price increase is slow.
* **Time is running out:** We only have 4 rounds left. While I could risk waiting to see if Bob will budge more, I'm not confident he will reach my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer with a slightly higher price, but I'll need to be more aggressive in the next few rounds to try and reach a satisfactory price. I'm still keeping the option of selling to John in mind, but I'm hoping to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your effort to find a good price.  However,  I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find a common ground.  I'm going to need to raise my offer to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the uniqueness of this product. If you're still interested, let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Pressure:**  I'm raising the price again, but this time more significantly, showing that time is running out and I'm not willing to continue negotiating for much longer. 
* **Slightly Aggressive:** I'm using a slightly more assertive tone to signal that I'm not going to budge much further.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting at the possibility of walking away from the deal if Bob doesn't agree.

**Strategy:**

With only 3 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price. I'm pushing the price a little higher but leaving room for a possible compromise in the final rounds. If Bob still rejects, I will be prepared to sell to John in the next round, as my goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we've been going back and forth, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,425. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,425. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,425
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not enough time:**  We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Unlikely to meet my price:**  The negotiation has been slow, and it's unlikely that Bob will agree to a price close to my minimum in the remaining time.
* **John is a better option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my desired price.  

**Strategy:**

With time running out, and Bob's offer not meeting my minimum, it's best to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  I've made significant progress in the negotiation with Bob, but it's not worth risking getting a much lower price when I have a better alternative."
