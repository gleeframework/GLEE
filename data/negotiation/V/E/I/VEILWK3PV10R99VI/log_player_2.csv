"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's.**  Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **There's still a buffer.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so even at $12,000 he's still getting a good deal. 
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and he risks losing the deal entirely.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a good price."
