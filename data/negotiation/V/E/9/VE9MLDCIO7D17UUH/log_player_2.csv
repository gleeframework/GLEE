"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that I value at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, so it makes sense to reject her offer and buy from John instead."
