"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  This gives us room to negotiate and still potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $900,000 is still a significant amount, it's far less than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his willingness to pay $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still low-balling me.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I can do better.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, but I still believe I can get a good price.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I think this offer might be the sweet spot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered the product's worth to him, which is $1,000,000.  While I'd love to make a larger profit,  accepting this offer is the best choice. It guarantees a sale and a decent profit, without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
