Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's getting close to my minimum and it's a good compromise.  I'm also concerned that if I reject his offer, he might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for a lower price."
