"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a bold opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's initial interest and potential budget. I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about acquiring it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value, and hopefully, a good starting point for further negotiation with Bob. I'm aiming to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm getting closer to my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go higher.  I'm not yet ready to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'll try to reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and only slightly above my minimum value. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but am also sticking to my principles. I'm hoping this will prompt him to increase his offer and finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. We're running out of rounds, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him to meet my minimum value. To avoid risking getting a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum value and don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
