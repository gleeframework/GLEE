Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential return on investment.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially maximizing profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential return on investment,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above the $1,200,000 mark. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** It's unknown if Bob is aware of other potential buyers or your minimum acceptable price. This strategy assumes Bob is motivated and financially capable of potentially paying more than $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, but ensure you don't go below your $1,200,000 threshold."
