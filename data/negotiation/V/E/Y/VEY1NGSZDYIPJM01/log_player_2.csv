Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested.

**Reasoning:** Alice seems unwilling to budge into a price range acceptable for me. Her latest offer is even higher than her first. It's time to cut my losses and go with John who offers a price within my budget."
