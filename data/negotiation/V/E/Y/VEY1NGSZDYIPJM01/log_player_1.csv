{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Being friendly:** A friendly message helps build rapport and might encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not set at my minimum of $150, allowing for a potential counteroffer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I have a safety net with John's offer of $150. If Bob doesn't meet my price expectations, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $80.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low offer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John's offer of $150, which I can utilize if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $60. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value for Bob:** I reiterate that $100 is still a good deal for him, as it's below his perceived value of $80.
* **Staying firm on my minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum of $150, giving me room to potentially negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to negotiate further, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired range. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is too low, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $75 is an improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I get my desired minimum.

**Next Step:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I might consider offering a price slightly above $100, potentially $110, to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $75. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution that benefits both of us. This can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying firm on my minimum:**  $110 is still above my minimum of $150, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects it, I'll have to weigh the possibility of selling to John or making another counteroffer."
