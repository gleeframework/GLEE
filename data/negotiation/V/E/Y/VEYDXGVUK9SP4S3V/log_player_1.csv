Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and the ""significant return on investment,"" appealing to Bob's motivations.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a much higher profit than selling to John."
