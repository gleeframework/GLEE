I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  I need to get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is still a significant profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's closer to my initial offer and signals that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm going to counter Bob with a price closer to my target, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation. I'm happy to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a quick and secure sale."
