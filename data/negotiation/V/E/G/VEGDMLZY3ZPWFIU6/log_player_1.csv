Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining.  I'm willing to push a bit further to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your proposed price, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher figure.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,100,000. This takes into account both of our valuations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is now offering my absolute minimum price, and it's unlikely he'll go any higher. There's no guarantee I can negotiate him up in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
