"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $145. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $135 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll try to push for something closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $138 is still a decent profit and it's unlikely Bob will go higher.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's lower offer."
