"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $145 is within his budget, he can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer,  $10 below Alice's initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.  It's also important to note that Bob has a backup option with John, which gives him leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still only $5 away from his target.  Continuing to negotiate has the potential to save him even more money.  Additionally, with 7 rounds remaining, there's plenty of time to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise. The $2 increase from his previous offer demonstrates that he's taking Alice's counteroffer seriously while still trying to get the product for a price closer to his ideal. With 6 rounds left, Bob still has time to continue negotiating."
