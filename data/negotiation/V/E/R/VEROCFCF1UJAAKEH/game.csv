"I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1600000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1650000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding common ground. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1580000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1620000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer at this time. Let's finalize this deal.",1620000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1620000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1590000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1590000.0,Bob,6,
