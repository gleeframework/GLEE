This offer starts at a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product for Bob, potentially motivating him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to my minimum. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
