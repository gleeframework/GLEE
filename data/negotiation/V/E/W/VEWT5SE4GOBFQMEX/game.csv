"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your point. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. How about $825,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
