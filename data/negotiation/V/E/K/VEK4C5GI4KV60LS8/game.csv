"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $9,800 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10,150. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,150, which would be $9,975. Can you consider this offer?",9975.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see you're making an effort to meet me halfway. However,  $9,975 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $10,062.50. This is a final compromise on my end, considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",10062.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, Alice, but $10,062.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",9900.0,Bob,8,
