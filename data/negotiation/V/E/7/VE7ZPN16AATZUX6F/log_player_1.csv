Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the product's value. At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer than John's guaranteed $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
