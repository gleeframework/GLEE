Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'm ready to potentially lower the price a bit if necessary. 
* **John as a Backstop:** I have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable or the negotiation drags on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  While it's more than Bob values the product at, it's not a good deal for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation. I can try to meet Bob halfway or offer a slightly lower price than my initial offer. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me bargaining power. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fact that my offer is still fair.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially counter again.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm still confident in John's offer, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good deal, Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Further rounds of negotiation could drag things out and potentially lead to a lower price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further would require more time and energy, and it's unclear if it will lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **John's offer as insurance:**  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a price lower than my minimum."
