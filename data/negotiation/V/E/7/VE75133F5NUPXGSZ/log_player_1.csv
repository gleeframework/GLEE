"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This allows room for negotiation and establishes my desired price range. My goal is to push Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired range. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway and we can close the deal in the next few rounds."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I hope this will encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unacceptable. It's clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation, as the chance of achieving my desired price is becoming unlikely. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum and ensures a quick sale."
