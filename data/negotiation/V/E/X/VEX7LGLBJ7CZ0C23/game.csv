"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, since that's my maximum.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $120.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet at $145? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product.",145.0,Alice,5,
