Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and push for a lower price, potentially getting closer to his desired $850,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $870000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has rejected Alice's offers twice, but Alice is now at a lower price than John's.  By accepting Alice's offer, Bob can save $30,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further, but there's also a risk she might raise it again, or Bob could run out of rounds before reaching a deal.  Accepting the current offer is the safest option to secure the product and save money."
