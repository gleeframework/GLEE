"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's a little lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good profit on the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair here.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a great price for the product, and it's the closest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm hopeful you'll consider it.",8750.0,Bob,6,
