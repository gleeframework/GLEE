Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**The Offer**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start confidently, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **High Anchor:**  $1,450,000 sets a high starting point. While it's below your guaranteed price, it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** You provide a soft justification (""fair offer considering its long-term benefits"") without going into excessive detail.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob will likely counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate down, but never go below $1,500,000.
* **John is your Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer gives you strength. You don't *need* to make a deal with Bob.
* **Psychology Matters:** Confidence, clear communication, and a willingness to walk away if necessary can significantly impact the outcome."
