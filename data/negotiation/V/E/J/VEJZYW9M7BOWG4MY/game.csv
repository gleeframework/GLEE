"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is the value of the product to me and also the price John is offering. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
