Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate if he's really interested, bringing me potentially closer to my maximum profit."
