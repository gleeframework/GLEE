{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations.  My initial offer is $950,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and the potential it holds for your business.  I'm open to discussing your thoughts and exploring possibilities for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer is only $50,000 more than that. I'm not desperate to sell immediately, so I'm going to try to push for a better price.  I can still sell to John for $800,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer is still a good deal for you, considering the potential it offers. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $875,000 is getting closer to what I want, but I'm confident I can get more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit too low. I understand you want to get a good deal, and I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to let go of this product for less than $890,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $890000. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and we've already gone through several rounds.  It's time to secure the deal and move on. I'm happy to take $880,000."
