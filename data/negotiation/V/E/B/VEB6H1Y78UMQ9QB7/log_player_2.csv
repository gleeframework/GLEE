"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the best value possible. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John makes accepting the offer the best course of action."
