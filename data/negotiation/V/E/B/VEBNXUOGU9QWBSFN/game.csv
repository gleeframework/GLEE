"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, as that's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm comfortable paying $800,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
