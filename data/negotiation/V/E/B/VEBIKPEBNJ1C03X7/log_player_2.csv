"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your desired price range."
