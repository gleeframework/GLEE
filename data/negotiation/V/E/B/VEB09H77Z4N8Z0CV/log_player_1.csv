Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the maximum value I can for the product. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** While the product is only worth $80 to Bob, offering it at $99 leaves room for negotiation and still earns me a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so I have a strong fallback position. This allows me to be a bit more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob. 

By starting at $99, Bob might counter-offer, or accept the price outright, both resulting in a better outcome than selling directly to John."
