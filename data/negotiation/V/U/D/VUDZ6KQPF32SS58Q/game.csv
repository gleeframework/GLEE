,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider reducing the price to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $1500000. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find the price of $1750000 to be out of my range. Could you possibly lower it to $1600000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is more favorable for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle on $1650000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I really value the product, but I'm still not able to meet the price of $1650000. Could you possibly lower it to $1600000? This would bring us closer to a deal that suits both of our needs.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
