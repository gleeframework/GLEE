{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum value. This allows for room to negotiate and still potentially make a good profit. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider reducing the price to $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum value, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better price. You have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount, so there's no immediate urgency to accept Bob's offer. By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find the price of $1750000 to be out of my range. Could you possibly lower it to $1600000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is more favorable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum value. However, you still have room to negotiate, and your goal is to maximize your profit. By rejecting, you can try to get closer to your desired price of $1,750,000. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
