"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for $1500000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you aligns perfectly with this price. Let's discuss further if you're interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save money, and Alice's offer is the full price you're willing to pay.  John offers the same price, so you're indifferent between the two. Since you're looking to *save* money, you should go with John, as this leaves the possibility open for Alice to reduce her price if she wants to make a deal with you."
