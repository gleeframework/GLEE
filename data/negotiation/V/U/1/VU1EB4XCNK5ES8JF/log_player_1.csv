Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. However, recognizing your interest, I'm willing to negotiate a price that benefits us both. What would you consider a fair offer?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming high with Bob initially leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility to Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential,"" the offer aims to justify the high initial price. 

This strategy allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000. If Bob rejects the offer or negotiations fail, Alice has the safety net of John's offer."
