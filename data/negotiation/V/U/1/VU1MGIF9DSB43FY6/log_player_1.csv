Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $90 is really pushing it, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $115 is closer, I'm afraid $100 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $120. I'm better off taking the guaranteed sale with John."
