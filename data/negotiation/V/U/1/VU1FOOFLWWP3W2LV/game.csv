"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $13,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is close, but I'm aiming for closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and call it $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,7,
