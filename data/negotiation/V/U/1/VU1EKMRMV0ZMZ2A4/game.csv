"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to meet you halfway. This still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
