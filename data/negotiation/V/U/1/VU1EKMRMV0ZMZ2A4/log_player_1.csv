"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'd like to make a better deal,  I'm not going to accept such a low offer.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to meet you halfway. This still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still above my minimum price of $8,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my minimum price and I've already gone through several rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, making it the best option at this stage."
