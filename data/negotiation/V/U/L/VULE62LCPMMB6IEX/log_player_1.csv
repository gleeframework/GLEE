Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant return on your investment while still allowing me to get a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,050,000, I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but not that much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
