"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers. How about $115? This still gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",105.0,Bob,4,
