"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I still have room to negotiate upwards and potentially secure a deal closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $925,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already in round 4 and the negotiations seem to be converging. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further counteroffers that could lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through entirely."
