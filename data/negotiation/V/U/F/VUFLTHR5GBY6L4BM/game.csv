"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $950,000?  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's significantly closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to drop my price to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,5,
