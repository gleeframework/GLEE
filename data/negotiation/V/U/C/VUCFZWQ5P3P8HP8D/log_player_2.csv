This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $450,000 less than John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better price, but there's also the risk Alice could walk away, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price."
