"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start low to allow room for negotiation.  It also puts the price closer to my ideal range and leaves space for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well below what it's worth to me, and it's significantly better than your initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still higher than John's price. I'll try to negotiate a bit further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I was hoping to land closer to $7,500. Would that be something you'd consider?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?  This would be a good compromise, allowing you to get a great deal on the product and me to still make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is only slightly higher than John's. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome and could risk losing the deal with Alice. It's a good idea to accept this offer."
