"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a common ground.  Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
