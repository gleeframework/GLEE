"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $950,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has already rejected Alice's first counteroffer and doesn't want to risk another rejection. He also doesn't want to play a prolonged negotiation game, which could lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise. Since John is selling the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most sensible choice to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
