You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $8,500? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
