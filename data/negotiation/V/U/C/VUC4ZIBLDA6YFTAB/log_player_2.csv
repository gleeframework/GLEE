Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000.

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, there's still a chance to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,250. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about $9,500, but I'll throw in a small bonus, worth $100, to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 with a $100 bonus is very close to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  While there might be a chance to get a slightly lower price, the bonus adds value and the risk of further negotiation could lead to a higher price or no deal at all. Accepting this offer secures a good price within Bob's budget and avoids the potential of a worse outcome."
