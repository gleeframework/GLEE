Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm thinking $120 would be a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  Keeping the message positive and friendly can encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard line, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how much I want to close the deal.
* If I'm not satisfied with the negotiation, I can always switch to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I consider a fair price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I can likely secure a better deal by countering. 
* **Value of time:**  It's more valuable for me to attempt to get closer to my target price than to accept a low offer now.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $100.  This will keep the negotiation moving while giving me a better chance of a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a great price for a fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his offer, making it seem like a better value at $95. 
* **Urgency:**  The message implies a sense of finality, subtly pushing Bob to accept to avoid further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've gotten a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to go lower. If not, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, could we aim for $85 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk isn't worth it.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating further with Bob is a gamble.  It's possible he'll reject any further counteroffers, and I'll have wasted time.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee a profitable sale."
