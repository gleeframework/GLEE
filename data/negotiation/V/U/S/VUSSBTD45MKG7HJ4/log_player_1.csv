Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $10,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but low enough that it might tempt him if he values the product even slightly more than that. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to consider."
