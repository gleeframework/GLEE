"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to work with me. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that 750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 900000. This is the best price I can offer at this point, considering the product's value to me is 800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not there yet.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for you to make a profitable sale. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go below 875000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me and the time I've invested in the negotiation. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,5,
