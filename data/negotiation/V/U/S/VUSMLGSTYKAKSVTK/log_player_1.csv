Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking Bob walking away entirely. I'll be closely watching his reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers.  Remember, I always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that far down.  I'll counter with a higher offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a significant profit.  $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that Bob might be willing to accept. We're both moving closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can make up the difference elsewhere.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
