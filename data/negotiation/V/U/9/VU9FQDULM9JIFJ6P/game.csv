"Thank you for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm working with a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, but I'm still struggling to reach $13,500.  Would you consider $10,500?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and my previous offer of $13,500, which is $12,000. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
