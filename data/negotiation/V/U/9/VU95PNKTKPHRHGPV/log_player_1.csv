Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $10,750. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both make a little effort. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. I believe this reflects a fair price for the value it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're coming down in price, which I appreciate.  However, $11,200 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  Let's work together to find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $11,000, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers. Accepting at $10,900 secures a significant profit over my alternative ($8,000 from John) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
