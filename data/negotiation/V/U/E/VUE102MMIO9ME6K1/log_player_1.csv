Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before accepting the guaranteed $120 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
