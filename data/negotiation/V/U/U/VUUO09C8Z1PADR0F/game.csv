"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. This takes into account the product's worth and potential benefits for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
