"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product's value is potentially even higher. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His reaction will provide valuable information for future rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me a strong position. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. This takes into account the product's worth and potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility (Slightly):**  While I rejected Bob's low offer, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.
* **Still Aiming High:** The $1,400,000 counteroffer keeps me well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits, encouraging him to meet me closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and I risk losing him as a buyer altogether. Accepting this offer secures a fair deal and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
