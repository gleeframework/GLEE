"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that's a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However, $9,500 is still a little too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8,750? ",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",9200.0,Alice,5,
