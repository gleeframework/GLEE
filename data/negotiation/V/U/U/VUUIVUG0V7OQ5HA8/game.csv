,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? It's still a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $97.50? This way, we both get a fair deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
