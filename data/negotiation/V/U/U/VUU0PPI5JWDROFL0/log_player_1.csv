Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $8200 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and I'll offer it to you for $8800.  This is a fair price for both of us and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $8400. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,400 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. We're only a few rounds in, and I believe we can still reach a mutually acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $8600.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do better. I'll offer $8300. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,300 is tempting and getting close to my lower limit, we've already had a few rounds of back-and-forth. I'm confident I can get a little closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. It's worth the risk to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.  Let's wrap this up!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been through a few rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is willing to negotiate, he's not budging much. We're only two rounds away from the deal falling through.  To avoid losing any more time, it's better to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
