Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to be willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 less than my initial offer and is still more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's better to accept this offer rather than risk a further reduction in price during the next round of negotiation or selling to John for $80."
