"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I could meet you halfway at $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Bob,4,
