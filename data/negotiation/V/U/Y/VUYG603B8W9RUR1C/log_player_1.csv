Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $10,000.
* **Confidence and justification:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring it in Bob's mind at a higher level. Mentioning you're ""open to discussing"" implies flexibility without directly promising a discount. 
* **Risk assessment:**  While a lower price might seem tempting to ensure the sale, Bob might be willing to pay more than your minimum.  Starting high allows you to gauge his interest and adjust if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are many valid approaches depending on your negotiation style and risk tolerance."
