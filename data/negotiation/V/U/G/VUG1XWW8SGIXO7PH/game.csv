,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,100,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly below my desired price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value our ongoing discussion and your persistence. While I appreciate your offer of $975,000, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer,  as I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
