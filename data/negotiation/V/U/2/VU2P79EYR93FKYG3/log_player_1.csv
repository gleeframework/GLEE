Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about $995,000? This is a more comfortable price for me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and further negotiation is risky. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 baseline and avoids potentially losing both Bob and John."
