"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not outrageously high. I want to see if I can get a quick deal or gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price. I want to see if I can find a middle ground and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I am not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will meet my price. I don't want to risk going any lower than my minimum, so it's better for me to sell to John and ensure I receive my minimum value."
