{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but gives him room to negotiate. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and focuses on the benefit for both parties.  

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to get the negotiation started.  I'm willing to drop below my minimum value of $15,000 to try and close the deal with Bob. However, I'm keeping the price high enough to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I can assess if he's truly interested, or if I should cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  I'm not willing to drop down to $10,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **I'm optimistic about the negotiation.** While Bob's initial offer is low, I believe there's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **I want to see if I can get Bob to budge.** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if he's willing to increase his price.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll carefully consider a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's $10,000 offer but still within a range that I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's a good deal for both of us, and it lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach an agreement.
* **Benefit for both:** I emphasize that this price benefits both of us. It allows me to get closer to my minimum value while giving Bob a better deal than his initial offer.
* **Closing the deal:**  I highlight that this price allows us to ""close this deal"", implying that I'm serious about making a deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering $11,000, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate.  If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I should continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still can't go above $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer to $10,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown he's willing to compromise. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  If I accept Bob's offer, I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still represents a compromise. I'm also aware that if the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John and guarantee a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Fairness and finality:** I emphasize the fairness of the price and the possibility of finalizing the deal. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Staying above minimum:**  The price of $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, making it a favorable outcome for me.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm also not willing to drop my price too much.  I'm hoping that this will be the final offer before I decide to sell to John."
