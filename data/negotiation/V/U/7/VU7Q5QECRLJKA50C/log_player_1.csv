{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

This offer is a starting point.  It's a significant discount for Bob, making it attractive, but still allows me to earn a decent profit. If he rejects it, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still too low.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a more favorable deal.  I'll counteroffer again to test the waters."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the price John is offering.

Bob's offer is at the limit of what I'm willing to accept.  However, I know that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a much better deal.  It's time to move on and secure the higher price."
