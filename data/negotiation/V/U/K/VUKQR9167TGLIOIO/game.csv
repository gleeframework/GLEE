"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
