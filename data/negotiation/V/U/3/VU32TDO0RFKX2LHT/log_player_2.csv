"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. It's above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there. $900,000 is closer, but I need to get a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  This could lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's no guarantee. It could also prolong the process, potentially wasting time.
2. **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point, providing a quick and definitive solution.

Considering the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better result, and the certainty of securing the product at his budget with John, Bob's best choice is to buy from John."
