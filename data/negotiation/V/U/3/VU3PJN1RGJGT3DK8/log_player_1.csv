Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping for some negotiation room.
* **Not too high:** I'm not going for the full $120 right away because it's likely Bob will reject that offer. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By starting at $115, it allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation to land somewhere in the middle.

This is just my initial strategy. I'll adapt based on Bob's response and his counteroffers. If things get too drawn out or if I'm not happy with the progress, I'll move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $105 is closer to my minimum than his initial value of $100, it's still below my floor of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle. 
* **Time is not a factor:** I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, so I can afford to keep negotiating. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $110? That's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully makes it more appealing to him. 
* **Fair and reasonable:**  $110 is still above my minimum price of $120, which is important for me.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encourages a continued negotiation, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful sale. If he rejects it, I'll need to assess whether to accept his next offer or move on to John for a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Not much room for further negotiation:**  Bob is already at his maximum, so there's not much room for him to go higher.
* **John is a safe option:** I can guarantee a sale to John for $120.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, at this point, it's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation with Bob. I'm going to make a final counteroffer to Bob, but if he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $112. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 112} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer to Bob, trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Reasoning for the price:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than his last offer ($108) but still below my initial offer ($115). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining some of my initial leverage.
* **Finality:** The message clearly states that if Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to John. This adds pressure for him to accept or risk losing the deal.

I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this counteroffer, but if he doesn't, I'm confident selling to John for $120."
