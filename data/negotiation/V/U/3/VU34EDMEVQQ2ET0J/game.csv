"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to purchase the product if we can agree on a price closer to $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget and you to receive a respectable profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit, while also giving you a great deal on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to stay within a certain range. Would you be willing to accept $1,150,000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still providing you with a reasonable profit.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
