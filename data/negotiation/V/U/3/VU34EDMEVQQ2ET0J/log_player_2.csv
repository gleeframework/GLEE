# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget and you to receive a respectable profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit, while also giving you a great deal on the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price but better than John's offer. However, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try another counteroffer, potentially aiming for a price slightly higher than $1,100,000.  This approach allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal while still staying within his budget."
