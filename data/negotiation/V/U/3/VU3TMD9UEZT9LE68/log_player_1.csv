Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth more to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product.  This still gives you a good deal, considering the value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - how about $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and still leaves you with a good margin."", ""product_price"": 13250}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're very close to a deal, and while I'd prefer a bit more, $12,900 is still a good price considering the potential of selling to John for $10,000. There are only 2 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
