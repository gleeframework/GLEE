"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $9,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offers to encourage a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit too low. Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but I think there's still some room to negotiate. I'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to move up a bit. How about $8,500? That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping it below John's price as I believe we can still reach an agreement."
