"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $9,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit too low. Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
