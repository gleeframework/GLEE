"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that I am serious about buying the product but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price range, but I can still try to negotiate a bit further. Buying from John is an option, but I think I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price point, while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $7,750. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's becoming clear that getting her much below this point might be difficult.  While I could try to haggle a little more,  $7,750 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's not worth risking losing the deal altogether by pushing further."
