"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,025,000 is still a bit high.  There are still a few rounds left, and Bob should try to push for a lower price. He's within striking distance of a deal he's comfortable with, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.  I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not come down to a price that is within Bob's budget. There are only a few rounds left, and the chances of her meeting Bob's desired price are low. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at $800,000, ensuring a deal within his budget and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
