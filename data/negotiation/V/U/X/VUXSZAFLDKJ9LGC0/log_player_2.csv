"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This shows Alice that he is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if necessary.  He's also being polite and acknowledging Alice's offer while emphasizing his need for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still $50,000 more than her minimum acceptable price. Bob is determined to save as much as possible and can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that is just above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows that he is serious about getting a deal, but is also still willing to walk away if necessary.  He is framing the price as a ""fair"" solution for both parties, making it more appealing to Alice."
