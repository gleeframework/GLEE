"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this figure.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
