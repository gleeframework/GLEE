"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Our initial offer is $900,000. We're willing to negotiate, but we're starting at this price to reflect the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's initial offer is tempting, it's still higher than her product's value to her.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering your product's value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we're not willing to go as low as $800,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than my ideal price point. I'm still aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering again allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to $825,000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still stay within my budget. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your budget constraints, but we're still not willing to go as low as $825,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer $850,000, but we're not willing to go any lower. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from her initial offer and is within my budget.  While I would ideally like to pay less, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
