Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe you'll find highly beneficial. Knowing how much this could benefit you, I'm offering it at a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 leaves some room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

By starting the negotiation at $950,000, you aim to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
