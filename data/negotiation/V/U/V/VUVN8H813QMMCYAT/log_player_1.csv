Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation. It highlights the value of the product to Bob and sets a positive tone for the interaction. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation process that could lead to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to sell just yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Showing I'm not desperate to sell at his price could encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Gather information:** Observing his reaction to my rejection will give me valuable insight into his willingness to negotiate further.

I'm confident I can secure a better price, so I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $900,000? This would allow me to still make a good profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $900,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.  
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution. I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win outcome.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $875,000 is a good compromise. It's  significantly better than selling to John for $800,000, and it's likely the best deal I can get from Bob. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Significant Profit:**  $875,000 still represents a substantial profit for me, considering my minimum price was $800,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation could risk losing Bob as a buyer and ultimately result in a lower price.
* **Time Factor:**  Prolonging the negotiation could delay the sale and potentially lead to unforeseen issues.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, which is the most sensible strategy at this point."
