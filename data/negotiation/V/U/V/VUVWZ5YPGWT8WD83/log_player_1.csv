Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to my business. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
