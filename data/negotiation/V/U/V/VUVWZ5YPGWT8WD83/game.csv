"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to my business. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant discount from my original asking price and is still a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm confident this price will be a good investment for your business.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking to get a better price.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet our goals.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 is still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To finalize this, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let's work together to get this done.",950000.0,Alice,5,
