Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob is offering $1,500 above my minimum acceptable price, and he's consistently moving closer to my offers. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $13,500 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $12,000."
