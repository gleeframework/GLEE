"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still above what I can realistically afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad to see you're serious about reaching a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,7,
