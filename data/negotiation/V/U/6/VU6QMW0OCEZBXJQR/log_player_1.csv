Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  How about $1,150,000? I believe this price is a fair middle ground and allows us both to get a good deal.
