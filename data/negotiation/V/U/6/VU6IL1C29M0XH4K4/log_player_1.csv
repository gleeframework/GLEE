Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price with John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,100,000 is a significant profit for me while still offering Bob a discount compared to its worth to him ($800,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" I subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and making the offer enticing enough for Bob to accept."
