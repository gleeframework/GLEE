"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is a good compromise for both of us. This would allow us to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $112.50, which would be $111.25. Can you consider that?",111.25,Bob,6,
