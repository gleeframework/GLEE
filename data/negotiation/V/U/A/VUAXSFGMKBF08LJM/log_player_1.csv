"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point, as it's a decent discount from what the product is worth to you, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a better offer than Bob's initial proposal, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. It's better to reject and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $110, but that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is a good compromise for both of us. This would allow us to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $112.50, which would be $111.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, we are running out of rounds.  The negotiation is going in the right direction, but I don't want to risk going too low and getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John."
