"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  I could come down to $10,000, but that's my best offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $9,250?  I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,
