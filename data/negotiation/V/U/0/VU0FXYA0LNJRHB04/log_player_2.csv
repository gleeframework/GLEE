Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm thinking $1,075,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $1,075,000 offer.  You've already signaled your willingness to pay $1,000,000, and further haggling may not yield a significantly better price. Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves you the uncertainty and potential for a worse deal with Alice."
