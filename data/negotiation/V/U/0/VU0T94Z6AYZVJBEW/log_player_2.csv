"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that you might be interested in. I know it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100. Alice is offering it for $110.  You can get the same product from John for $100. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $10."
