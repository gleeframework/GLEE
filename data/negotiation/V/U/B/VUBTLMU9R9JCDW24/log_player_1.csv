"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Bob's offer of $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether.
