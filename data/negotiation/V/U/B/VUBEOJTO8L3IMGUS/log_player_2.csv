"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $110 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand her flexibility and potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  We're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice.  How about $95? That feels like a fair price to me."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to the middle ground while still aiming for a price below $100. This approach keeps the negotiation active while seeking a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $102? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle.  While we could likely negotiate a dollar or two lower, $102 is a reasonable price and saves us a decent amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept."
