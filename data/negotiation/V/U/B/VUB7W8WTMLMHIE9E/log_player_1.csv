Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's the best I've received so far, and it's a fair compromise considering his financial constraints.  There's always a chance I could get a better price in future rounds, but there's also a risk that Bob might walk away or I might have to sell to John at a lower price.  Taking the $10,000 now is the most sensible choice."
