"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its potential, I'm confident it could be worth $1,200,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800,000.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
