"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone sets the stage for a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob helps justify the price and builds his interest.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  While $90 is better than selling to John, there's still room to improve the price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. I'll consider factors like his willingness to pay and my desire to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I'm offering. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting a middle ground price to show I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:**  The message emphasizes a fair deal for both of us, which helps build trust and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm not conceding fully, hoping to find a price point closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle again at $97? That's a significant step from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $97 is a very good price, considering my minimum is $80. It's within a reasonable range of my desired profit.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to make a decision that secures a profitable sale.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, making it more likely I'll have to sell to John for $80.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures I get a good price and avoids further negotiation risks."
