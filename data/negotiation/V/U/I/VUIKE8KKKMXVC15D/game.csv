"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I'm offering. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That way, we both get a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle again at $97? That's a significant step from my initial offer.",97.0,Bob,4,
