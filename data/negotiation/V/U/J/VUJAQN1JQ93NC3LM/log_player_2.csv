"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $10,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for both parties to benefit from a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This is still a good price for you, as you value the product at $8,000, and it's closer to my target. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should try to negotiate further. There is still room for both parties to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000 yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $9,200 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already negotiated a significantly lower price from Alice's initial offer.  While he ideally wants to pay $9,000, accepting $9,200 is still a good deal for him. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but the risk of Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price isn't worth it.  This price is a good compromise and ensures both parties walk away satisfied."
