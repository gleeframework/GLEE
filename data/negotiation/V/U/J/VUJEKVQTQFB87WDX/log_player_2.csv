"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its worth while offering you a significant discount compared to its market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a discount from the market value, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway to facilitate this transaction. Therefore, I would like to offer the product at $11,000. This price still maintains a good margin for me while allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for the lowest possible price.  While $11,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to reach his target price of $10,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm happy to meet you at $10,500. This is a good middle ground for both of us, and it allows us to complete this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your openness to negotiation, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to accept $10,750 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being accommodating to your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that will enable us to proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down to $10,750, this is still above Bob's target price of $10,000.  Given that John is offering the product for Bob's target price, it is more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and save $750."
