"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! My starting price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is a little below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and avoids him feeling immediately pressured.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking for his opinion to start a dialogue and see his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept such a low price this early in the negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly, highlighting my willingness to find a solution.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message with an invitation to continue discussing, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $90 is still below the $150 I can get from John.  I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I have a few more rounds before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference - how about $105? It's still a good price for both of us, and we can move on from here."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Appeal to Reason:** I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two offers, highlighting a desire to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive Language:** The message maintains a positive tone and reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Clear Next Step:** I suggest that accepting this price would allow us to move forward in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I've already offered a considerable compromise, and it seems like Bob is trying to push me further.  I'm willing to give it another try and see if we can find a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's really my bottom line.  If we can agree on that, I think we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final, firm offer at my absolute minimum acceptable price.  This emphasizes my seriousness and creates urgency for Bob.
* **Appeal to Positive Outcome:**  I highlight the potential for a ""win-win"" scenario if Bob accepts the offer.
* **Closing Statement:**  I end the message by stating my bottom line and suggesting a positive outcome if the deal is closed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $100 is still a bit too high. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round before the deal automatically goes to John, who will buy the product for $150. Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since I've already made my final offer and Bob hasn't budged, it's time to take the guaranteed $150 from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting nothing."
