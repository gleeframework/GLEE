"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer,  $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get closer to my desired value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
