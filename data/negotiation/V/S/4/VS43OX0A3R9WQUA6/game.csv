"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
