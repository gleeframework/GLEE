# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
