"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Although it's within your budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You have a strong bargaining position because you're prepared to walk away and buy from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on this product and my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is only $80,000 above your ideal price of $800,000.  It's a good deal considering:

* You've already rejected two counter-offers from Alice, and she's shown a willingness to negotiate.
* You risk losing this opportunity if you keep rejecting offers and Alice decides to stop negotiating.
* You have the backup option of buying from John for $800,000. 

Accepting this offer means you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
