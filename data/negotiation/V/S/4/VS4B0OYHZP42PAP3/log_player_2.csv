Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further negotiations.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $775,000?"", ""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which would be $812,500. However, I'll throw in an additional concession by offering a 1% discount on top of that. So, my revised offer is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this offer saves you $200,000 compared to John's price."
