"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which would be $812,500. However, I'll throw in an additional concession by offering a 1% discount on top of that. So, my revised offer is $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,5,
