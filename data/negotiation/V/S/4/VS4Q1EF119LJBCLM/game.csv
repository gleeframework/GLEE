"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this valuable product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
