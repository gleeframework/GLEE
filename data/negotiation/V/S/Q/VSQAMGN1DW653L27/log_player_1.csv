Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal and would be perfect for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for you to make a profit while still being potentially tempting to Bob."
