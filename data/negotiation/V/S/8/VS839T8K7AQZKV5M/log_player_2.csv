# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to experience its value at a slightly discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal! You're getting a $5 discount, and while you might be able to haggle it down a little more, it's not guaranteed and you risk losing the deal altogether."
