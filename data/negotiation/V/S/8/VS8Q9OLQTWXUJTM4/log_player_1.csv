"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. There's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he clearly values the product enough to make a counteroffer.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a higher price point. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to reach a deal before I run out of rounds and have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise and is close to my desired price. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's a good idea to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
