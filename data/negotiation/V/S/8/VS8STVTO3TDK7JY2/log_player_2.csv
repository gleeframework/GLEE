Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is asking for $14,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $3,000 reduction from Alice's initial price shows your seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for compromise. 
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how much she's willing to budge on her asking price.
* **Stay within your budget:** This counteroffer is still within your budget, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While her offer has dropped, it's still above your budget.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, which is enough time to try and bring the price down further.
* **John is a safety net:** You can always fall back on John's offer, so there's no need to rush into a deal.
* **Counter-offering shows you're serious:**  By continuing to counteroffer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and that you're not willing to accept a price that's too high."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:**  A $500 increase from your last offer shows you are willing to compromise but not settle for Alice's current price.
* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By continuing to counteroffer, you keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price.

**Important Note:** The goal is to get as close to your desired price as possible, and staying within your budget. Each counteroffer should be a calculated move towards that goal, assessing Alice's responses and considering the remaining rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still above your budget:**  While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still $500 above your desired maximum.
* **More rounds left for negotiation:** You have 5 rounds left, so there's still room to try and get a better price.
* **John is still a backup:** If things don't work out with Alice, you can always buy from John for $12,000.
* **Showing resolve:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you demonstrate that you're not willing to settle for a price above your budget, even though it's getting closer. 

**The next counteroffer should aim to bridge the gap between your desired price and Alice's current offer. A counteroffer of $12,250 could be a good option.**"
