"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high and work your way down to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to be mindful of time and the potential of losing the deal,  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, my minimum threshold.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more profit from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 

I'm offering $12,500. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my initial asking price.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a price that will both satisfy me and convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me,  Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum threshold. It's better than selling to John for the same price, considering I'm nearing the end of the negotiations.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
