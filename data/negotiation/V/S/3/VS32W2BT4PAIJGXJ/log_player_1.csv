I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,500 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,700 just isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet halfway again. How about we close the deal at $8,850? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 8850}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8750. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  I'd rather close the deal with Bob now than risk getting a lower price from John or having Bob walk away completely."
