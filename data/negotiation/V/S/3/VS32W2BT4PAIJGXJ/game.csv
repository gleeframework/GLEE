"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8700 just isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet halfway again. How about we close the deal at $8850? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want.",8850.0,Alice,5,
