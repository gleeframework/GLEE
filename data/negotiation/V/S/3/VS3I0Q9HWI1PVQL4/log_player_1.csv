Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is still a fair price for this product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
