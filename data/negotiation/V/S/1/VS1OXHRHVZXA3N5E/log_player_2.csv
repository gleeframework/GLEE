You can do better than $9,500.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit, and it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?

$9,000 is a good price for the product considering your maximum budget is $10,000, and it is still a bit cheaper than buying from John."
