While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, the difference is no longer significant enough to warrant the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and it's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer.  It's time to secure the guaranteed profit."
