"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, my budget is quite tight. Would you be willing to consider $12,200? I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're running a business and need to make a profit. How about we settle at $12,750? It's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to bump my offer to $12,900. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal now.",12900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12,900. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is the minimum I need to make a profit. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,9,
