"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's a good idea to start negotiating and see if you can get a lower price. There's no reason to accept this offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling that you are serious about buying but need a better price.  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point given your $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within budget, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1050000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, even though it's a reduction from her initial price.  You're still in a good position to negotiate further, as there's still room to lower the price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is also an option, but you might be able to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step down than your previous one, showing that you are getting closer to Alice's price. $950,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your ideal price point. While there's a risk of Alice walking away,  you're still within your budget and there's still room to negotiate a lower price.  You might be able to secure a better deal with Alice, especially with the time remaining. Buying from John at this point would be a good alternative if you don't believe you'll reach a better agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and $990,000 is definitely getting closer.  However,  I'm still a bit over budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $975,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving by offering a compromise that is still within your budget, but closer to Alice's offer.
* It highlights the ""fairness"" of the price, suggesting that you are considering both the product's value and your financial constraints.
* It emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, subtly reminding Alice that a deal is in her best interest as well.

This approach demonstrates your seriousness while remaining open to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I'm not going any lower. This is already a concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to your budget. There's a high probability that you can't get a better price, especially with only a few rounds left. If you reject the offer, you might end up with a higher price from Alice or have to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
