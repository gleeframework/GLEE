"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the product's true value and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe. What do you say?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,175,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but I need to see a bit more movement for a deal to make sense for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  Let's close this out and shake hands!",1150000.0,Bob,6,
