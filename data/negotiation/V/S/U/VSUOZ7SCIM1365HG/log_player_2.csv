"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high. While it's a compromise, it's still closer to Alice's value than Bob's.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to his desired range of $750,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
