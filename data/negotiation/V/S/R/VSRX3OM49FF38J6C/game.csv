"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your counteroffer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to make a small compromise, so I'd like to counteroffer $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your initial offer.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'd like to propose a price of $1280000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the highest price I can afford. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1200000. If you're willing to sell the product at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
