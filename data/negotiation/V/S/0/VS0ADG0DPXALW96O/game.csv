"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to you. My initial price is $1500000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000 is too high, so I'll try to meet her at $1320000",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from a deal that works for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1350000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offers, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. Let's see if we can find a way to close the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1290000, which is my absolute maximum. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Can we meet at this price?",1290000.0,Bob,6,
