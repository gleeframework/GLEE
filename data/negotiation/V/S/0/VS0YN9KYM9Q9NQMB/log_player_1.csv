"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiating a fair price. How about $13,000? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential concessions and counteroffers, giving me the opportunity to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** A friendly approach can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** I cannot afford to sell the product for $10,000 as it is below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **More negotiation is needed:** I still have 8 rounds left, and there's room for further negotiation with Bob.  I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe bet, I want to explore further negotiations with Bob to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I understand your budget, but this product is really worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me some breathing room."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a reason:** I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer, I'm providing a justification for my counter-offer. This helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $11,500 is halfway between my last offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my counter-offer is still fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we try $10,500?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I can't afford to sell it for that amount.
* **Time to consider John:**  With only 6 rounds left, the negotiation is getting more serious.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming a more attractive option.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I'm not giving up on Bob completely.  My next counteroffer will be more strategic, potentially moving closer to his offer or even offering a deal that includes additional benefits to make it more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm mentioning ""getting us closer to an agreement"" to subtly suggest that time is running out and it's in both of our interests to reach a deal soon.
* **Strategic approach:**  $11,000 is a bit closer to Bob's offer ($10,500),  but still above my minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects this offer, I will be in a better position to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $10,750.  I'm hoping that shows you I'm serious about buying, but I also need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is getting tight:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. Selling to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly tempting.
* **Possible final counteroffer:**  I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll make one final counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. If that fails, I will likely sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to make one final offer of $11,250.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to move on to other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is presented as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially motivating Bob to accept. 
* **Slight compromise:** The offer of $11,250 is a small concession from my previous offer but still closer to my desired price than Bob's last offer.
* **Reminder of value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm trying to close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects, I will likely accept John's offer in the next round, as my minimum acceptable price is still not met."
