"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,900,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly high initial offer (almost double the product's value) allows room for negotiation while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit.  If Bob accepts this high price, that's fantastic. If he rejects it, there's ample room to negotiate downwards and still get a great deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is simply not feasible for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum and the product's actual value. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to go lower, but not that low this early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  Would $1,400,000 be acceptable?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting a price halfway between the initial offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($800,000), I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer still provides room for further negotiation if Bob comes back with another counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit rich for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now negotiating more realistically, but $1,100,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to push a little further since I have several rounds left and he's showing a willingness to move towards my price range.  I'll aim for a smaller concession this round to keep the momentum going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $150,000, a smaller concession than Bob's $300,000 drop. This shows I'm willing to move, but not drastically.
* **Strong Position:**  I'm still significantly above John's offer, so I have room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob focused on its benefits and my higher valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000.  This is a fair offer, and I think it's time we close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is a significant profit over my minimum price and John's standing offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, there's a risk of negotiation fatigue. Bob seems eager to close, and pushing further might make him less willing to compromise.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now means I secure the profit sooner rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer. 

While I could potentially squeeze a little more out of Bob, accepting this offer is a smart move to ensure a profitable and timely sale."
