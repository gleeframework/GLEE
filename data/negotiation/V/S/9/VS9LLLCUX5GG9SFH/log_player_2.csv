"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $95. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90,  which is still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still paying more than you'd like, but it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps you in the negotiation and could lead to a better deal."
