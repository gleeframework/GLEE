"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target of $85. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $88 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for considering my previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product for $89, which is just $1 over your last offer. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** Buying the product for $89 is a good deal for Bob. It's only $1 more than his last counteroffer and well within his budget of $100. 
2. **Reject Alice's offer:** Bob can continue negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or Bob might run out of rounds.  

Given that Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and the price is very close to Bob's target, it's a good decision to accept the offer and secure the product."
