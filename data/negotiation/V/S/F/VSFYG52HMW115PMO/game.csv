"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $105, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can offer $95 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I can do $102.50, which is a bit closer to your offer, but still a good compromise for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. I can offer $97.50 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $105. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $102.75, which is a small increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",102.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.75. I can offer $98 for the product. I'm willing to take a small risk that I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'd rather buy from you if we can meet on a price.",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go below $105. I'll make one final offer: $101.50. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",101.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you've compromised a lot, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable with $101.50. I can offer $99 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet on this price.",99.0,Bob,10,
