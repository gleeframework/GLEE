"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1,000,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while being reasonable for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise that's closer to my target price. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
