Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,800,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,500,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. Based on my budget and financial situation, I am unable to agree to $1,600,000. My best offer remains $1,550,000. I hope this aligns better with your needs.

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm at $1,550,000. Accepting this offer nets a significantly higher profit than John's guaranteed $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob without securing a better deal."
