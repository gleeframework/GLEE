"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're hoping to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,325,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
