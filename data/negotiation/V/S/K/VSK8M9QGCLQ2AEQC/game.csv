"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value it at $1500000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a new offer of $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a deal of $975000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850000.  If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to go with another seller.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,6,
