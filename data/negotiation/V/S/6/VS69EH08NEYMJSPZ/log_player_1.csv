Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal, especially compared to selling to John for $80.  It also avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price or him walking away."
