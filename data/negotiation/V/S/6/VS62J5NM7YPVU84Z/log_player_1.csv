"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go that high, I was thinking more along the lines of $80 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is already a competitive price. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $100, I was thinking more like $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for $100, accepting $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's a profit, and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing both buyers."
