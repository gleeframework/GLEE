"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its value to you, and I'll get a good price for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting it for less than its value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $12,500 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to do it for $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,750 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
