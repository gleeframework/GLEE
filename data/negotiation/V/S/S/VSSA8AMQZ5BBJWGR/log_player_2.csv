{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value proposition of your product, $500,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We understand the importance of aligning with your budgetary considerations.

Alice's counteroffer of $400,000 is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $350,000, but it's closer to your budget. You can potentially still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $400,000 is still a bit out of my budget, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

This price reflects the value I see in your product, while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 375000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price for our flagship product. After careful consideration, we are pleased to offer the product at a price of $390000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our valuation of the product and your budgetary constraints.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $390,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $375,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed that you'll be able to get a lower price.  It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product for a price within your budget."
