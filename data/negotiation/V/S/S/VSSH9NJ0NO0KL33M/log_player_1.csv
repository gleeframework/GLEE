Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value for Bob, emphasizing the potential benefit and encouraging him to consider it.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** This strategy offers a starting point for negotiation. It allows me to potentially earn more than $15,000 if Bob is willing to pay closer to my minimum price. 
* **Risk Management:**  While I'm taking a risk by lowering the price from my minimum, I'm also ensuring that I can potentially get a better deal than selling to John. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** $12,000 might be a reasonable price for Bob, especially if he values the product more than he initially indicated."
