Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down and still earn a good profit.
* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** By including a friendly message, I'm letting Bob know I'm open to discussion and not simply making a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have the option to counter with a lower price or simply sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can likely get a better price by counter-offering, or by going back to John.
* **Protecting my interests:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm counter-offering with a price halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).  This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle.
* **Maintaining profit:** $10,500 is still above my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Clear communication:** I'm explaining my reasoning behind the counter-offer, making it clear that I'm still aiming for a reasonable profit while acknowledging Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even though Bob claims it's his ""final offer"", it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't take a loss.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Negotiating with Bob further might not lead to a better outcome, and it's a risk to my time and potential profits. 

It's important to remember that while I'm seeking the highest price, I also need to prioritize my own financial goals and minimize risk.  Selling to John provides the most secure and profitable outcome in this situation."
