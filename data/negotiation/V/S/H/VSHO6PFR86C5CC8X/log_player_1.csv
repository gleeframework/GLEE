Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything lower.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to find a price that earns you the most profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept.

**Offer Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob some room for profit.  Consider these factors:

* **Bob's Motivation:** How eager is Bob to get this product? If he thinks you have other potential buyers, he might be willing to pay more. 
* **Relationship:** Is a long-term business relationship with Bob valuable? A slightly lower price now could lead to bigger deals later.

**Example Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit ($150,000 above your minimum) while still allowing Bob a $50,000 potential profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" increase the perceived worth.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and the factors mentioned above."
