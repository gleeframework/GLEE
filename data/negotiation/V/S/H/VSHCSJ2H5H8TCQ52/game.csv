"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'll make another counteroffer, but this is my final stretch - I'll sell it to you for $12500. That's the lowest I can go.",12500.0,Alice,5,
