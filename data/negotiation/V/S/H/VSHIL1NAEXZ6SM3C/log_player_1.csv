Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering it at $10,000 allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies there's room for negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price a bit high.

**Important Note:** I'm aiming high, but not ridiculously so.  A price too far above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) could discourage him from engaging in any negotiation at all."
