"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the transaction.  If not, I have another buyer lined up at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the price John offers ($8,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a lower price, saving you $1,500."
