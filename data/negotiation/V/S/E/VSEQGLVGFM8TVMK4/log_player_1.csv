Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum threshold of $80 and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $80.  It's also a good indication that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
