Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob only values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 creates a sense of a deal for Bob while still securing a significant profit margin for me. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything as I can sell to John at my desired price."
