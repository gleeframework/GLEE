Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down again, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. Please think carefully about this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's final offer is still significantly better than selling to John. Additionally, there's a risk that Bob will actually go through with buying from John, which would be a huge loss for me. Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
