"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal considering the value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. Please think carefully about this offer.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
