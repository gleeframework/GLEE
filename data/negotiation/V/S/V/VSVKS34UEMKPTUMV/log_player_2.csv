"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value to you, I propose a special introductory offer of $12,000 for this exceptional item. This price reflects the substantial benefits it will bring to your endeavors and allows us to establish a long-term partnership. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can move forward together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer of $15,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $8,000."
