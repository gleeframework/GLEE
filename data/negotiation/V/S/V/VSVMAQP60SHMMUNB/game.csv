"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. I think that's a good compromise, considering the value this product brings.",8500.0,Alice,5,
