Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression that the product is worth more. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher price point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might still be higher than what he would have offered if I started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** I always have the option to sell to John for $80.  Therefore, I don't want to get locked into a negotiation with Bob that goes too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own valuation of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price and push him closer to a more reasonable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This tactic often feels fair to both parties. While it's not exactly the middle ground between the initial offers, it's a significant movement towards Bob's counteroffer and away from my initial high offer.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** $95 is still a reasonable profit margin over my minimum ($80) and John's offer.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will give me a better idea of how flexible Bob is willing to be and if a deal is possible within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hmm, $95 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While $75 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum ($80) to justify accepting. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations takes time, and there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher.  Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **Potential for Future Business:**  Accepting a slightly lower offer could lead to a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to future business opportunities."
