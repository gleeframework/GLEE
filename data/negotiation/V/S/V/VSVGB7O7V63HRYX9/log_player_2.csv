"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is far above your budget of $800,000. It's crucial to start negotiating and push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and begin the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my best price, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget. While it's a better price than her initial offer, I'm still not willing to go above my $800,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully find a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which reflects a compromise and shows my genuine interest.  This is my final offer before I need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
