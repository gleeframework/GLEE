"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a comfortable profit. This should encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my target price and is still a good profit.  It's better to accept his offer now than risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John at a lower price."
