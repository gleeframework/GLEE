Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still thinking that $9,000 is a fair price for the product, so I'll try to meet her in the middle again, but this time closer to my target.

{""message"": ""I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really think that's the most I can afford."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
