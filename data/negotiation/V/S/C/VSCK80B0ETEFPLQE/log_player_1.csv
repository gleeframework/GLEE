Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:**  Asking for too much (close to $120) risks Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Fear:** Asking for too little (close to $80) leaves potential profit on the table."
