"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique and valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate.  I'm aware that Bob's value for the product is lower, but I'm hoping to convince him that the product is worth more than his initial assessment. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to take his offer, it would leave me with a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll attempt to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, but I'll also be cautious about going too low and risking a better offer from John.  I'm aware of the limited rounds and will consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential value to you.  It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $950,000, which is still above my minimum of $1,000,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it also keeps my potential profit substantial.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using a positive, collaborative tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground, offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my desired range.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly before the rounds run out, but I'm also aware that if Bob continues to haggle, I might have to consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $725,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $725,000 is still too low for me. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, it's not close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm running out of time, but I'm unwilling to settle for a deal that leaves me with a significant loss.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll need to make a more aggressive counteroffer to try and push Bob closer to my desired price. I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't budge. The clock is ticking, and I need to make a decision soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $725,000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $850,000. This is my final offer. If you're truly interested in acquiring this product, I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $850,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's offer.  This shows a strong commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer. I'm also using a direct and firm tone, hoping to push Bob into making a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm running out of time, so I'm making a significant concession. This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's the closest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping that the combination of a lower price and a clear message will convince Bob to accept.  If not, I'll have to consider selling to John, as the remaining rounds will not be enough to negotiate further."
