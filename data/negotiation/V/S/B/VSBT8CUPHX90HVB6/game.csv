"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential value to you.  It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $725,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a reasonable return.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $725,000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $850,000. This is my final offer. If you're truly interested in acquiring this product, I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your decision.",850000.0,Alice,5,
