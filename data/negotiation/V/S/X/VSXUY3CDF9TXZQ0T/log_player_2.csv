"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject the offer because you can get the same product from John for a lower price.  You can make a counteroffer to Alice and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really hoping to get the product for closer to $8,000. That's my absolute limit, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000?  That's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has already rejected your counteroffer and isn't willing to go lower than $9,000.  This means that you are better off just going with John who is willing to sell you the product for your desired price."
