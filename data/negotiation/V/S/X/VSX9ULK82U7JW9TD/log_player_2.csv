"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's the first round and Alice's offer is higher than our ideal price. We should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to move on price.  We also include a polite message to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is offering the product at her value ($100). It's unlikely we'll get a better price, and waiting might risk losing the deal. Accepting now ensures we get the product at a reasonable price."
