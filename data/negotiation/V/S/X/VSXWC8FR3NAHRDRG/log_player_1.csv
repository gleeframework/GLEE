Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The offer is fair, considering I value the product at $12,000 and Bob values it at $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counter-offer, which can lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Backup Plan:** If the negotiation fails, I can sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  While Bob's initial offer was too low, there's potential for a more acceptable counter-offer in the next round. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to maintain leverage.
* **John as Backup:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I receive my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** My counter-offer is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Finding Common Ground:** $8,500 is a midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous offer, aiming to find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, ensuring I don't sell for less than what it's worth to him.
* **Room for Final Agreement:** This counter-offer provides space for a final agreement if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $7,250 is a good compromise, meeting us almost exactly in the middle.
* **Profit Margin:** While lower than my initial goal, $7,250 is still a profitable sale.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation risks the possibility of Bob withdrawing his offer or getting frustrated, potentially leading to a lower final price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to Bob at this price allows me to secure a deal quickly and avoid the potential loss of time and effort in further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**  It's a reasonable compromise, and I can still make a good profit by accepting Bob's offer."
