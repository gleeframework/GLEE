Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you'll make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This makes it more likely he'll accept, as he still gets a good deal.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, there's still room for you to adjust the price further. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,750 isn't ideal, it's very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and still a good deal for you.  Accepting this offer is the best option in this scenario, as rejecting it might lead to further haggling and potentially a lower price, or forcing you to sell to John for $8,000."
