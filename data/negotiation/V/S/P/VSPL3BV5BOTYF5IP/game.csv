"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $135 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $132? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",132.0,Alice,5,
