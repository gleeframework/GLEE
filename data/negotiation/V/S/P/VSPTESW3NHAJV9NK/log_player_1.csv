Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob seem to be stagnating.  We're getting closer to a deal, but it's not happening quickly enough.  Rather than continue to haggle, I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  It's important for me to secure the best price, and I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision at this point."
