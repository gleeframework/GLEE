"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This aligns better with my budget constraints. I look forward to your response.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're finding common ground. However, I'm still not able to meet at $1,350,000. I propose $1,320,000 as my final offer. I hope this meets your needs while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,330,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",1330000.0,Alice,5,
