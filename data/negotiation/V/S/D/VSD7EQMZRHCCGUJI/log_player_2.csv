You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay such a high price. This might lead Alice to propose a counteroffer closer to her product's value ($1,000,000) or your fallback option ($1,500,000 from John)."
