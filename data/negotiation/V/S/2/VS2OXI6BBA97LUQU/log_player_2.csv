"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to meet that price. Would you consider $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation! I'd rather try for a lower price from Alice before defaulting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. How about $925,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems like Alice is stuck at $925,000 and unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's better to cut our losses and buy from John for $1,000,000. We're already in Round 7, and further negotiation with Alice might not yield significant savings to justify the time and effort."
