Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing our fallback is $150 from John.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price needs to be appealing to Bob, meaning it should be ideally lower than his perceived value of $120.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still go down a bit and remain above our minimum."
