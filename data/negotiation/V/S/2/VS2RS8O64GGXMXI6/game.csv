"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you in the middle at $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit high.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  I'm ready to buy it at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,100 out of this deal. Can you meet me at $8,100?",8100.0,Alice,5,
