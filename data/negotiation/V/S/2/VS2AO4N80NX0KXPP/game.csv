"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000, making your offer unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth and potential of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 remains significantly below the product's true value. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a substantial concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $975,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford for the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the progress has been slower than I'd hoped.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's unique value proposition. If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to move forward with another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980,000. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.",980000.0,Bob,8,
