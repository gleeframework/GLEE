Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000, making your offer unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth and potential of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in early stages of negotiation.  While $950,000 is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, it's still substantially lower than both our desired price and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 remains significantly below the product's true value. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a substantial concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $975,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford for the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving in the right direction, but very slowly.  We are now over halfway through our negotiation rounds and he's still significantly below $1,000,000. It's time to apply more pressure and signal that we're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the progress has been slower than I'd hoped.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's unique value proposition. If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to move forward with another buyer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This message conveys several important points:
* **Urgency:** We're running out of rounds.
* **Finality:** This is not an invitation to counter at $990,000.
* **Alternative:**  We're reminding him we have another option if he doesn't value the product highly enough. 
 
This tactic aims to either close the deal quickly or provide clarity on whether Bob will realistically meet our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980,000. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's increases are minimal, showing strong resistance to reaching our desired price point. 
* **Bluff Called:**  His mention of buying from John for $800,000 is highly likely a bluff to pressure us.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing with Bob risks a lower final offer or even him walking away. Accepting John's offer guarantees us the full $1,200,000, which is a significant $220,000 more than Bob's current offer and far exceeds the risk of continued negotiation."
