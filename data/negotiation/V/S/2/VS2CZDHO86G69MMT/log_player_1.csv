``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value ($8,000), giving me some room for negotiation while still being fair.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, and we can work out a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $8,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in buying it for $7,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000?  That's my final offer, and it's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it avoids any further negotiation.  I'm happy to accept his offer and sell him the product."
