"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, Bob! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $88. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and $88 is within my budget and a good deal considering I was aiming for $85. While I could try for a lower price, I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
