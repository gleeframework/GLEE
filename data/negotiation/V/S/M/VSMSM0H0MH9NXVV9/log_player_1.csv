Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, as I know I can always sell to John for that amount.  This sets a clear baseline for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting,  $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for a counteroffer that gets us closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,100,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to his offer but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to both of us, and it allows for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more. There's always the option of selling to John if this negotiation continues to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's very close to his last offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement. If he rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has gone on long enough, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not the ideal scenario, but it's the best outcome considering Bob's unwillingness to meet my price."
