Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is too low for me. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so how about $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is the product's value to Bob, it is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $10,500? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, so how about $10,750?  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
