"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $13,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I still think $12,500 is a bit steep. How about we try $11,000? I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I need to be closer to my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $11,750? This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",11000.0,Bob,8,
