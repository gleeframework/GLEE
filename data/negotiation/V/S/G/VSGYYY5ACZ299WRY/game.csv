"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks like a great product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be completely transparent with you, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe you'd benefit greatly from this product, so I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
