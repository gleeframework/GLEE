Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for a product of this quality.  How about we meet halfway at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the minimum we need. John offers a guaranteed $15,000 which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
