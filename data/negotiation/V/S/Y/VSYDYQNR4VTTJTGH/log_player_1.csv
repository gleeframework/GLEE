Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I've assessed its worth to you and am confident that $1,200,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob given how much he values the product. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds for your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant return on your investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is still significantly more than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
