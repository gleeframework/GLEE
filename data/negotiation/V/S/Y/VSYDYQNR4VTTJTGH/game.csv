"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business.  I've assessed its worth to you and am confident that $1,200,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds for your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, which still gives you a significant return on your investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to my company.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
