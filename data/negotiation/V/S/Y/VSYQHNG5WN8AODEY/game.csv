"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,025,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to get it at a price I'm comfortable with.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Bob's persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1,020,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
