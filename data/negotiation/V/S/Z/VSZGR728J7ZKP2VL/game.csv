"Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product. I'm interested in it, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $75 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $68? ",68.0,Bob,4,
