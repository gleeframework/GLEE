"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her. There's a chance she'll come down closer to her product's value of $800,000 to avoid losing the sale."
