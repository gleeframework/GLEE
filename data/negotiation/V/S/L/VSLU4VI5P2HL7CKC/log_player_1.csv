Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to let it go for $135.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is a reasonable starting point:** It's a good compromise between your minimum value of $150 and Bob's perceived value of $120. 
* **The message is friendly and enticing:** It highlights potential benefits for Bob and avoids being too pushy.
* **There's a safety net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum price. 

This approach aims to maximize your chances of selling the product at a good price while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
