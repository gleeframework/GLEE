"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $1000000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is my best and final counteroffer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to split the difference with my previous offer and go with $1200000. This is truly my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
