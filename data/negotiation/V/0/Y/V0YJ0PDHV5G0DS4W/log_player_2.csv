# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I have to make a living, and $85 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50?

You have three options:

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $91, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we call it a day at $91.50?

It's time to accept the offer.  You've successfully negotiated the price down to $91.50, which is a good deal considering your maximum budget of $120.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price."
