"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To show I'm willing to be flexible too, let's settle at $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
