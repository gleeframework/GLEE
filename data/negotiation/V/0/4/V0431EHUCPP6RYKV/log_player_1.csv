Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 allows for room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob makes the price more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for a deal.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to $100.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll sell to John for $80 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price of $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, forcing me to sell to John for $80. 
* **Time Factor:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit.

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to compromise slightly to secure the deal.
* Accepting this offer ensures I earn more than selling to John."
