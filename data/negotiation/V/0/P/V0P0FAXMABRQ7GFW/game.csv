"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
