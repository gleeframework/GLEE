"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above your maximum budget and you know the product is worth less to her.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is my maximum budget.  This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my preferred budget. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still within my budget and puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she knows I can buy the product elsewhere for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to come down in price, her offer is still above my preferred budget. At this point, I'm close to my maximum, and there's a risk of going back and forth endlessly with Alice.  Since I can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, I'll choose the guaranteed deal and avoid further negotiation."
