Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it as justified by the ""unique value and potential."" This encourages Bob to focus on the product's benefits rather than just the price tag.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts my initial high offer, I win big.
2. **Gain Negotiating Power:** Even if he rejects it, I set a high anchor point, potentially leading to a more favorable final price. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** I haven't committed to Bob yet, keeping the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value of $800,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can push Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still below its true worth.  How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 2050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $250,000, which might signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **""Meeting Halfway"":**  Framing it as meeting halfway creates a sense of fairness, even though it's not technically a perfect split of the difference.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,800,000, I may need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,900,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will budge, and I risk losing him as a buyer entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
