"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save money, and Alice's initial offer is your maximum price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. 
*  There's no immediate advantage to buying from John since Alice's offer is already your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* I'm confident that Alice will likely reject this offer, allowing me to continue bargaining. 
* I want to establish a lower price point early on and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my desired price point. 
* I'm not yet at a point where I feel the need to settle for $110, especially with more rounds left. 
* There's still room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise. 
* At $105, I'm still saving money compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might be accepted by Alice, considering she lowered her price in the last round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and we're close to my target price.
* Accepting at $108 is a good deal considering I'm saving $12 compared to John's price and $2 compared to my last counteroffer.
* There's a risk of continuing to negotiate, but with limited rounds left, it's safer to accept this offer and avoid the possibility of not getting a deal at all."
