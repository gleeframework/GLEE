Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so $115 gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you have some room to negotiate down.
* **It's a clear offer:**  It states the price directly and includes a friendly message to open the conversation.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong, leaving room for counteroffers while still being above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Continue negotiating:** You can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to you.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:**  Bob might be willing to go higher if he sees you're serious about getting your desired price.

**Next Steps:**  

You should make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** $110 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to your desired price point.
* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of a good profit margin.
* **Encourage agreement:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for both parties.

By meeting Bob halfway while still staying above your minimum, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his initial offer of $105 despite your counteroffer. This indicates he's unlikely to budge further.  Given that John is willing to pay your minimum price of $120, selling to John is the most logical decision:

* **Maximizes profit:**  $120 is your highest possible profit.
* **Avoids further negotiations:**  It eliminates the need for further rounds of counteroffers, saving you time and effort.
* **Guarantees a sale:**  You are certain to sell the product and receive a guaranteed amount.

While you could continue to negotiate with Bob, the likelihood of him accepting a higher price is slim. It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed offer from John."
