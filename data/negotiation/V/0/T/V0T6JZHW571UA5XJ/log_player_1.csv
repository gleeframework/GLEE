Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see if Bob is interested at this price, and if not, how low he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price is appealing enough to Bob that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum price, and I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $16,500.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm glad to be done with the negotiation."
