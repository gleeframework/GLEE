``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives him room to negotiate, but still allows me to potentially make a profit.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's still a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  We'll see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can stretch to $9,500. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll be happy to sell to John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $9,300. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to move on and sell to someone else.  "", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

I'm offering $9,300, which is only $100 more than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. This is my final offer, so Bob needs to decide if he wants to accept it or not. If he rejects it, I'll go with John and sell for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,300 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $9,000. I've already gone as high as I can, and I really need to stay within my budget. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'll accept the offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $9,000, which is still below my minimum price of $12,000. While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement, it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay more.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's a better deal for me."
