"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a competitive price for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer can help gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a negotiation range. It's important to be polite but firm in your counter-offer.  While $6,000 is a significant difference from Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation while staying within a reasonable distance of your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but $13,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation.  You should continue to counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:**  This counter-offer directly states your ideal price, which aligns with John's offer and your budget.
* **Signals Limit:** Offering your maximum budget can signal to Alice that this is likely your final offer, encouraging her to accept if she's willing to go that low.
* **Opens Door for Compromise:** By suggesting ""somewhere in the middle,"" you maintain a collaborative tone and leave room for Alice to potentially counter with a price slightly above $8,000. 

This strategy aims to reach a deal quickly while staying within your budget."
