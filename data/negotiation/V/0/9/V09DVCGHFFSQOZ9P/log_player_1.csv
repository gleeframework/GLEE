"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the deal as a good opportunity for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for a potential counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting high, I set the bar for the negotiation.
* **Gain Information:** Bob's response will tell me if he's interested and what his range might be.
* **Keep Options Open:** If Bob rejects, I can still go to John for the guaranteed $15,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept, it's not in my best interest at this stage.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and might be able to secure a higher price in the following rounds.
* **John as a Backup:**  If the negotiation fails, I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, ensuring a profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not at a drastically lower price. 
* **Moderate Reduction:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality and value,  justifying my price. 
* **Positive Language:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable solution.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This strategy aims to find a middle ground between our current positions, moving the negotiation closer to a potential deal.
* **Maintaining Control:** By making a counteroffer, I'm not simply accepting Bob's terms,  keeping the negotiation dynamic. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll go with $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to accept it yet, as there is still potential for a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Limited Risk:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain the negotiation process and can potentially secure a better deal in the next round.
* **Backup Option:**  If the negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing a profit.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price that is mutually agreeable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference: I'll go down to $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our last offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Urgency:** The message implies a sense of finality, encouraging Bob to consider accepting the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price gets me to my minimum acceptable profit, while still leaving some room for negotiation in the following rounds.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  If Bob rejects, I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000.
* **Moving Forward:** This offer provides a clear path to a potential deal,  moving us closer to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'll go down to $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower profit, and there's no guarantee that he'll accept any further counteroffers.

By selling to John, I ensure a secure and profitable outcome."
