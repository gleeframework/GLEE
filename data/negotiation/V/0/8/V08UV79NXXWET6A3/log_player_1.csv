Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than $95 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, leading you to sell it to John for $80."
