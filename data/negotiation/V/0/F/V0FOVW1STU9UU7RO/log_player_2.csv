"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $7,000 is a bold move, but it's a starting point for further negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a price closer to his ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $8500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is a good compromise.  Bob has a clear limit of $15,000 with John, and Alice's offer is significantly lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a fair price and avoids the potential of further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
