Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I'm attempting to shift Bob's focus from the price to the potential benefits, potentially increasing his willingness to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John. This allows me to negotiate confidently and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of $8,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $12,000 would mean losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Aiming Higher:** By countering, I can try to close the gap and secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product provides is substantial. I could come down to $19,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a noticeable price drop to show flexibility and encourage Bob, but I remain well above my minimum of $15,000 and John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""final offer"" I'm aiming to accelerate the negotiation and potentially push Bob to make a decision or a more serious counteroffer. 
* **Balancing Act:** I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good price from Bob and not pushing him away, risking losing him to no deal at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is now higher than John's standing offer of $15,000.
* **Profitable:** This price still gives me a good profit margin and is a favorable outcome compared to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids a potential stalemate."
