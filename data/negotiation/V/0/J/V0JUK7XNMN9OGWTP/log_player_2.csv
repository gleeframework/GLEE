# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You're only saving $500 by buying from Alice right now, and you can potentially save more by counteroffering."

Alice is still holding out for a higher price than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a compromise."

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to my target, and it's only $300 more than what I initially offered. It's a good compromise and a decent deal for me."
