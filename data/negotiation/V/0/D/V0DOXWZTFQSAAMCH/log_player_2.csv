{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is far above my maximum budget of $100.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me think about it... I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $180, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $100. I've made my position clear, and she's not willing to budge.  At this point, it's more advantageous to simply purchase the product from John for $100. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
