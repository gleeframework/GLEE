"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make it a more attractive offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
