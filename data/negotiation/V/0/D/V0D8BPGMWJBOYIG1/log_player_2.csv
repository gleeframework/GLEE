# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $900,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $875,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best we can do. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we try $885,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's managed to get the price down to $885,000, which is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing as the rounds go by."
