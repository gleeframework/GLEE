Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $120, which is above my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:** This price is still significantly less than the $150 value Bob places on the product, making it likely he'll accept or counter-offer.
* **Flexibility:** This strategy allows me to adjust my price if Bob counters, giving me room to negotiate and hopefully land a deal closer to $150. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $100 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, but I can potentially do better.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  While $100 is acceptable, I don't want to settle for the minimum right away. Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at the minimum price. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his $100 offer, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $100 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and I let you have it for $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer presents a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the value Bob is getting by emphasizing it's still a great deal.
* **Negotiation Position:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at the minimum price, encouraging Bob to potentially come up slightly. 
* **Maintaining Control:**  By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I demonstrated that I'm not afraid to walk away if the price isn't right, which can strengthen my negotiating position."
