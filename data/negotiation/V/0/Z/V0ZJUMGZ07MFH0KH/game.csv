"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the $1,000,000 offer is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. Would you be open to that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,625,000?  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I could meet you at $1,400,000.  That's the best I can offer.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, but I have a responsibility to maximize my return.  Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $1,500,000? This represents my absolute lowest price.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
