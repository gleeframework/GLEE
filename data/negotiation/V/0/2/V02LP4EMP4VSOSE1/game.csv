"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  I think that's a fair price considering its current market value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $13,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here.  While I want to find a price that works, I'm not willing to go below $10,000 for this product.  It's a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",10000.0,Alice,5,
