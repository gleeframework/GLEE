"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's standing offer.  While there's a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's risky.  Accepting John's offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
