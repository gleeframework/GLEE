"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle on $1,025,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
