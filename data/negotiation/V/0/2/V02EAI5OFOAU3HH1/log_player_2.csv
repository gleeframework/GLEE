"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 elsewhere."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?

While $1,075,000 is closer to your goal, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?

Alice is offering the product for $1,075,000, which is higher than what you can get from John ($1,000,000). While the added extras are tempting, it's not worth overpaying for the product. It's better to stick with your initial goal of getting the product for the best possible price, and that's by buying from John."
