"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is an exceptional value considering its quality and the benefits it provides. Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your experience with our top-tier solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay, there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Starting with a counteroffer allows you to explore getting a better deal before resorting to buying from John at full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (but not offensively low) gives room for negotiation. It tests Alice's willingness to lower the price and gives you a starting point to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your needs while still valuing our product appropriately, how about we meet in the middle at $105? We believe this price reflects both the value of the product and your financial considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her counteroffer shows flexibility. While $105 is better than the original $120,  there's still room to negotiate a slightly lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. $105 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we make it $98?"",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while inching closer to a price that works for you. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but need her to come down a bit more. The goal is to find a balance between potential savings and the risk of Alice losing interest in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to work within a certain budget, Bob. Considering the value and quality of our product, I think we can find a fair compromise at $102. Let me know if this works for you, and we'll proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is likely nearing her bottom line, and $102 represents a significant discount from her original price. Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars more risks her accepting a better offer elsewhere or becoming less willing to bargain. Accepting at this price secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
