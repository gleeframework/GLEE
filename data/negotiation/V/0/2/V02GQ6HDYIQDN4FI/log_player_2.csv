# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $875,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
