"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $155, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $130, which is more than John's price and closer to what I feel is fair.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to pay more than John's offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $130. I'll sell the product to you for $142.50.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'll meet you halfway between $142.50 and $135. I'll sell the product to you for $138.75.",138.75,Alice,7,
