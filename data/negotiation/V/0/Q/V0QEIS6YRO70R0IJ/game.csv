"Alice, your product is a bit too pricey for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $850,000 for this.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference and go with $812,500. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! While $812,500 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to offer $790,000 to try and close this deal. What do you say?",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $790,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both agree on.",800000.0,Alice,7,
