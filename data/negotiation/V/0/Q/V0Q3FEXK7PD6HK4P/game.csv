"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,5,
