"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $11,200 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000,  I'm going to sell to John. This negotiation is taking longer than expected, and I'm concerned that Bob may continue to lowball me.  It's safer to sell to John for my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
