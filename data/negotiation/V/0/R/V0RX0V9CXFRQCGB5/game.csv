"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a great value for you. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Could we perhaps aim for $1400000? This would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
