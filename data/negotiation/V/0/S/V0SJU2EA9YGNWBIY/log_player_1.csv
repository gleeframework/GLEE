Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for a quality item! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I don't want to be too aggressive and risk Bob immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and his message shows he values the product.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price.

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $100, but that's the lowest I can go.  It's still a great deal for the quality you're getting. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my offer to $100, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  My message is friendly and leaves the door open for further negotiation."
