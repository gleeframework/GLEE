Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that is still significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still a good deal for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving a safety net (John's offer) if Bob decides to reject the initial offer."
