"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, but I understand its true worth lies in the hands of someone who can appreciate it fully. Given its importance and rarity, I believe its fair market value is $1,500,000. However, I am willing to consider a negotiation to find a price that works for both of us.

To make this offer more compelling, I would like to propose a deal where you could purchase the product for $1,250,000. This price not only reflects its intrinsic value but also allows for a reasonable profit margin for me while providing you with a substantial saving compared to its market value.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your interests and budget. I am open to discussing further details or considering alternative arrangements that might suit both parties better.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice

While you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a price you can afford and saves you money compared to your alternative."
