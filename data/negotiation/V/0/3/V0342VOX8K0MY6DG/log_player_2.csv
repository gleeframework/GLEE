"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000.
*  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the offer, leading to a stalemate. It's likely that Alice is near her bottom price, and further negotiation may not be worth the time and effort.
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without the risk of losing out on the deal."
