"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. My initial offer is $1250000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1175000? This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.
