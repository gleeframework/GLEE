Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount,  and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its value. I'm proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $14,000, the message hints at its value, prompting Bob to consider its potential benefits.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and desired profit margin, you could start with a different offer."
