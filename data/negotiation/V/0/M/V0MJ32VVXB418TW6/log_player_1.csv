Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum.  I still have 8 rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product might not justify such a high price. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have time to try and get a better deal. I want to see if I can push him a little closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000. Let's split the difference and try $1,325,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally finalize this sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think $1,325,000 is a bit steep given the current market conditions. I would like to propose an offer of $1,275,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  Although we're getting closer,  $1,275,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more time to see if we can meet in the middle. I still have 4 rounds left."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,275,000 is still not working for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time at $1,300,000.

I'm going to sell to John.  We're very close to a deal with Bob, but I don't want to risk going another round and ending up with a price below my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 now than risk ending up with less."
