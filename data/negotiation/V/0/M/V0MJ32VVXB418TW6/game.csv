"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  My initial price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to negotiating a fair price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product might not justify such a high price. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000. Let's split the difference and try $1,325,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally finalize this sale. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think $1,325,000 is a bit steep given the current market conditions. I would like to propose an offer of $1,275,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair price for both parties.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,275,000 is still not working for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time at $1,300,000. This price represents a significant value for you, and it's the lowest I can go at this point. I'm confident we can both be happy with this agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutual agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,285,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair price while still respecting the value you place on the product.",1285000.0,Bob,8,
