"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,4,
