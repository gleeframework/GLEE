{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  While I initially aimed for a higher price, the negotiation process has shown that Bob is a serious buyer who is willing to compromise.  It's better to secure a sale at a good price than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
