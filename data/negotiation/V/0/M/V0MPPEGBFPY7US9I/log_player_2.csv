"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's desired price. By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident that $13,500 would be a fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise and ensures a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still think $13500 is a bit below the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at Bob's initial counteroffer price:**  Alice has come back to $14,000, which is what Bob originally offered. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  John is selling the product for $15,000, which is more than Alice's current offer. 
* **Negotiating further might not be fruitful:** Bob has already rejected a similar price, and further negotiations could be unproductive or lead to a higher price if Alice changes her mind.

It makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer at this point as it's the best price he can get without risking a higher price from Alice or being forced to buy from John at a higher cost."
