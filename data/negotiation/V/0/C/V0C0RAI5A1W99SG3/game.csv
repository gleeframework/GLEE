"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I'm confident we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,250 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",8250.0,Bob,6,
