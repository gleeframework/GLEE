Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I'm confident we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,250 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already made a few concessions, and I'm concerned we might be getting stuck in a stalemate. I don't want to risk losing more time and ultimately ending up with a lower price. It's better to sell to John now for a guaranteed $10,000."
