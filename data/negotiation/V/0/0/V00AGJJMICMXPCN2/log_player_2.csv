"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll see the benefits and make a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob. Even though it's slightly more than Alice's value ($800,000), it's $100,000 less than what Bob would pay John. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob money."
