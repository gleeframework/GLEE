"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,150,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit while being within your budget.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the price I was originally willing to pay for the product from John. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
