"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you directly, which is below the market value, as I value our relationship and want to make a deal happen. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting this saves you money."
