"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get a better deal.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to come down in price.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if she rejects it, I'll have more data to work with in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is encouraging. However,  $750,000 is still more than I'd like to pay. I'll reject her offer and counter again, hoping to close the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $725,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get the best price.  This should be a good compromise and hopefully get us closer to a deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, I might consider going to John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but she's moving in the right direction. I'm still not happy with her price, but it's getting closer to my ideal range. I'll reject her offer again, hoping to push for a better deal. I'm willing to risk going to John if the price doesn't drop significantly in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 740000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $740,000. This is a small increase, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm still trying to get a good price, and I believe this offer might be enticing enough for Alice to accept. If she rejects it, I might consider going to John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but she's still too high.  We're getting to a point where I need to be careful. I don't want to go to John, but if Alice doesn't budge much in the next few rounds, I might have to. I'll reject her offer and continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 765000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $765,000. This is a small increase, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Alice to accept. If she rejects it, I will likely go to John in the next round.  This is our last chance to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire. Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm running out of time.  I've made my best effort to negotiate with Alice, but I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially end up with no deal.  John's offer is higher, but it guarantees I get the product. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
