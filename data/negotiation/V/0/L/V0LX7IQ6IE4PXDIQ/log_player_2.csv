"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  This is a great deal, as I'm selling it to someone else for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Your goal is to save money, and buying from John guarantees the best price."
