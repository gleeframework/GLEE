"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is cheaper than John's price, you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $110 to $105. This is a good deal for you, as it is lower than John's price and still leaves some room for profit for Alice. It's likely that if you reject this offer, Alice might not lower her price further, so accepting this offer is the best option in this scenario."
