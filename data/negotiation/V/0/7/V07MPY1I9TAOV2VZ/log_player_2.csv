"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discounted rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discounted price,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a more favorable deal than my initial offer, while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I hope this revised proposal aligns better with your budget and we can move forward with the transaction.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000,  it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting and counter-offering again could potentially get the price closer to Bob's ideal target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After considering your latest offer, I am pleased to extend a counteroffer of $890,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and aims to provide a satisfactory deal for both parties. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you, and we can finalize the transaction soon.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to secure the product.  $890,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
