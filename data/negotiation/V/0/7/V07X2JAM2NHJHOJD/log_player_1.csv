"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offering, hoping to find a middle ground."

You have three options:

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
