"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value and could be a real asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a substantial gain for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is considerably higher than what you've proposed. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your desired profit and my budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me partway with your offer. It seems like we both recognize the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price, especially considering the potential this product holds for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a significant profit for you, and it would allow me to comfortably acquire the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
