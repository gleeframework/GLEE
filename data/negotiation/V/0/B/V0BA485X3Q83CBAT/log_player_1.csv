{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and go with $117?  It's still a great price for this product, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 117}
