Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's important to price it higher than your guaranteed $80 from John to ensure you're aiming for the best possible outcome. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob will reject $90, but it's the best approach to potentially earn the highest profit."
