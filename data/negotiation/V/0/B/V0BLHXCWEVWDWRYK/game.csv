"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $90?  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below what you'd be willing to pay.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my last offer. How about $85? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
