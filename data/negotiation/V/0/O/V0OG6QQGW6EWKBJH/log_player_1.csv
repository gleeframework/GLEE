Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows us to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $400,000 discount from the product's perceived value to him.
    * We make a $100,000 profit compared to John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing the offer as time-sensitive, we create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
