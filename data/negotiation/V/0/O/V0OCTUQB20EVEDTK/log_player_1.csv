Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is expected in a negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message can help encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $80.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price. 

It's better to secure a deal close to my minimum rather than risk a longer negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
