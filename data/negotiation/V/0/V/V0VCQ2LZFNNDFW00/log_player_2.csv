"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have the option of buying from John for $100, it's best to reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You're within your budget with John's offer of $100, giving you room to push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there though. How about $110? I'm very interested in the product, but that's the highest I'm willing to go at the moment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered the price to $112, which is still within your budget but not a great deal. You've already established that you're willing to pay $110, and there's a chance you could continue negotiating and get closer to your goal.

However, you've only got five rounds left. If you keep rejecting and making counteroffers, you risk running out of time and having to pay John's price of $100, which is already a safe option for you. 

Therefore, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal with John now and avoid the risk of losing a better deal with Alice."
