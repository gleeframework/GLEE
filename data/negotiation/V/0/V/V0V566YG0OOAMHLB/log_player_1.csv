Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him room to negotiate, but still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counter-offers, I have the flexibility to either accept a price closer to my minimum or make a counter-offer myself.
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge of John's offer at $12,000 gives me a solid fallback position.  This means I can be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob without risking a sale for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have the leverage of knowing John's offer of $12,000. This allows me to continue the negotiation with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $10,000 or even higher.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I might be able to secure a better price without risking selling the product for a price significantly lower than what I could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This approach shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is ready to pay $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm on a price that's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a bit higher than what I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $9,250 is getting closer to my desired outcome, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean missing out on a potentially higher price from John. 
* **Further Negotiation:** I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, knowing that I have John as a backup. There's still a chance to secure a price closer to my target by making a counteroffer or potentially getting Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up with a new offer.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $9,400. It's a great price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Progress:**  By offering $9,400, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. It shows that I'm actively trying to reach an agreement. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a middle ground between Bob's latest offer of $9,250 and my previous offer of $9,500.  It increases the odds of Bob accepting.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000, I'm not pressured to accept any offer that's significantly lower than my desired outcome.  This gives me the flexibility to negotiate without rushing into a deal."
