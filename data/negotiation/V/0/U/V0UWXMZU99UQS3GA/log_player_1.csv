Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you shouldn't sell for less than this amount.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the offer as valuable. 
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob.

By starting at your minimum acceptable price, you leave room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but wants to discuss the price."
