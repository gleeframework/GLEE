{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't feel the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close to my minimum value, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal from him.  It's better to secure this sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer of $1,000,000."
