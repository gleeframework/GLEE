"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
