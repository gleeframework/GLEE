While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, there is still a gap of $50,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and bridge this gap. There's a chance he could get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,225,000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only $40,000 more than what Bob can get from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product and minimizes the cost compared to buying from John."
