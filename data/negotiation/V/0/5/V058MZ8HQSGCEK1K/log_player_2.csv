"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in, and I'm confident it would serve you well. While I value this product at $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
