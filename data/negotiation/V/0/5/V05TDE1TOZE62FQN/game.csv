"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident you'd get a lot of use out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a great return on my investment. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
