"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $136, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",136.0,Bob,10,
