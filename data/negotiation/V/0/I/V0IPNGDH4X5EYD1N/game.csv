"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only justify spending up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to go above $10,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $11,250 for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
