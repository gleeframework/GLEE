# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to you, there's room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a better deal.  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's still room for both of you to make a profit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your suggestion, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I can do $10,250, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd ideally pay less,  $10,250 is still a good deal for you. It's within your budget of $12,000 and you've already saved a considerable amount compared to John's price."
