"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. This is a firm price, but I'm open to discussing the details further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $1350000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference at $1425000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects that.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1425000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1350000, so I'll offer $1387500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",1387500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your firm stance.  However, $1387500 is still a bit too low for me. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1406250. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's make this happen.",1406250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1406250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for this product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
