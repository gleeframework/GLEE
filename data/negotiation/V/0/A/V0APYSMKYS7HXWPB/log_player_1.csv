Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll receive.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low for me.  I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer.  I still have plenty of rounds left and haven't exhausted all options."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $1,280,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with further negotiations. It's getting very close, and I only have four rounds left. However, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached my limit with Bob. He's clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is not ideal, it's the best option to guarantee a sale and meet my minimum target."
