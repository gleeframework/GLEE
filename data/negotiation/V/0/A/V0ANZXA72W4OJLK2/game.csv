"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives me a decent margin while hopefully being within your budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $95. That would be a good compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
