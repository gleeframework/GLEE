"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $10,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $11,250?  It's closer to your offer, and it would let me get closer to what I need.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
