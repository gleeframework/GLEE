"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000? That's a good price for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $10,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet at $11,250?  It's closer to your offer, and it would let me get closer to what I need.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
