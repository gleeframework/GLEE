Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your response. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $825,000. I hope this price better aligns with your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for us. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

We're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation. Accepting $825,000 would be over budget. We'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can get closer to John's price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. My counteroffer is $785,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing for a profitable transaction for us. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and at $785,000, the price is attractive enough. While we could be stubborn and try to push for an even lower price, there's a risk Alice could walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose it and have to buy from John at a higher price."
