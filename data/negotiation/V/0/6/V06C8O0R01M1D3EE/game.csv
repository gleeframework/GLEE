"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",550000.0,Alice,3,
