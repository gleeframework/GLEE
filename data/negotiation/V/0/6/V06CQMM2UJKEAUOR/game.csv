"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000 for the product. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
