# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000 for the product. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still significantly higher than your budget.  You've already made a significant counteroffer, and it seems Alice is unwilling to come down further. To avoid wasting more time and potentially exceeding your budget, it's best to purchase the product from John for $8,000.  You'll save money and avoid further negotiations."
