Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. We have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference between our last offers - I'm willing to accept $887,500. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $875,000 again. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, I'm running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get Bob to go higher than $875,000.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a price that's above my minimum acceptable price and secures the sale.  There's also a chance that Bob might come up with a better offer in the next round, but it's risky to wait."
