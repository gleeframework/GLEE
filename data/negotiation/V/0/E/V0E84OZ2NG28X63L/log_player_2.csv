``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Even though it's lower than what John is asking, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **Rejection leads to better price:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate with John or find another seller potentially willing to drop the price closer to Bob's desired range."
