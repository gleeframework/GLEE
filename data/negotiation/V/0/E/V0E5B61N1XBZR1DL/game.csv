,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but  I could only consider a price closer to $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $145 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $80? I believe that's a fair offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $80 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $115 for a quick sale.  This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
