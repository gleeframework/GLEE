Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a backup buyer, John, willing to pay $100, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed. 

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of a profitable sale."
