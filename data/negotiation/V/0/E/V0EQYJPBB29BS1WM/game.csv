"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800000. This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000, which is a significant reduction from my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
