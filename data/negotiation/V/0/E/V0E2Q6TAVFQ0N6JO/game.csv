"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's closer to your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,
