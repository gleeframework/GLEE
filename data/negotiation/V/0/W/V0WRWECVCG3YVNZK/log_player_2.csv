"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. While the product is worth more than $10,000 to me, I know I have a backup option with John. It's best to negotiate and see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? This is a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product at a price that's still beneficial to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above my maximum price. I'll try to negotiate a little further, but I'm ready to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
 ""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

Alice is not budging enough. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a much better deal. It's time to walk away from this negotiation."
