"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9200. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions.",9200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay up to $9800, but I'd like to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $10250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not willing to go as high as $10250, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $10000, which is still a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I'll make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9900. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $9900 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",9500.0,Bob,8,
