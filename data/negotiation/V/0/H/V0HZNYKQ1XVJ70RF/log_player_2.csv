"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
