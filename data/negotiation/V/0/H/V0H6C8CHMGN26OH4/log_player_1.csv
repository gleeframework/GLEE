"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to make a fair initial offer to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $90 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below what I'd prefer to get.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can get closer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $90 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  To avoid risking a deal with John, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $90."
