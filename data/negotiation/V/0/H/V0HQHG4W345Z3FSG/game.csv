"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it, given its worth to me.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm confident the product is worth more in the long run, I'm willing to meet you partway.  How about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me while also allowing for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
