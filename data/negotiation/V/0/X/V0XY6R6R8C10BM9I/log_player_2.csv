"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob has 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  However, $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a better offer than $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. With 7 rounds left, Bob still has leverage to negotiate a lower price.  He should continue to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers. While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has 5 rounds to try and get a lower price. It's important to remember that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, meaning she still has room to negotiate. Bob should continue to push for a price closer to his target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting close to an agreement.  I'm still very interested in this product, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,025,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still a significant distance from Bob's target price of $800,000.  With 3 rounds remaining, there's still opportunity for negotiation. Bob should continue to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident this product will be valuable.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,012,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a price closer to his target.  Alice has consistently been unwilling to go below $1 million, and there's a high risk that she'll reject Bob's final counteroffer.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000, which is within Bob's budget and guarantees a successful purchase."
