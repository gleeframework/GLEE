"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $145?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $135.  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
