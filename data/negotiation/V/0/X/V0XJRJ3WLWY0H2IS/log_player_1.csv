{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer sets the initial price at your minimum acceptable value, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $145?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $135.  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is still below my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  Bob seems serious about buying the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and avoids further negotiation."
