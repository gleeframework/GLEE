Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $9,500 is lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($10,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate and incentivizes him to make a deal.

By starting with a high offer, I can potentially maximize my profit. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives us both a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer to my desired profit margin.  Furthermore, if I reject his offer and continue to negotiate, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 offer from John.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
