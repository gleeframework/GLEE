"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $1,050,000, he's making a bold move, showing Alice he's serious about a deal but also demonstrating his willingness to walk away if the price isn't right. This initial counteroffer allows for potential negotiation while keeping a healthy buffer between his offer and the backup option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, making her offer very close to Bob's ideal price point.  While a counteroffer might potentially get a slightly better deal, the risk of further negotiation might result in Alice rejecting the offer and the deal falling apart. Buying from John is still an option, but Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while minimizing financial risk."
