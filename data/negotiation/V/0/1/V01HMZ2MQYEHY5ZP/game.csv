"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price would still allow you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go right now.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 represents a fair price considering its true value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
