"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, there's room for compromise. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having the option to buy from John provides a fallback if negotiations with Alice fail."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This price would still allow you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 represents a fair price considering its true value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within budget:**  $1,350,000 is within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Compromise reached:** Alice has already moved from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer risks prolonging the negotiation and potentially ending up with John's higher price. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at $1,350,000 secures a good deal within his budget and avoids the potential for a less favorable outcome."
