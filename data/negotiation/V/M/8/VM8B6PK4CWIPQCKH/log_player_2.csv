"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is worth exploring:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** Knowing you can buy from John for $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep. Would you consider $85? I'm willing to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and within the range of what the product is worth to her.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** Mentioning being ""willing to close the deal"" demonstrates your interest in the product while still maintaining your negotiating stance. 
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** While you're aiming for a lower price, $85 is still a good deal for you compared to John's $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now reasonable:**  $87.50 is a good compromise and is very close to your desired price of $85.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While you could try for a lower price, it's possible Alice will refuse, and you might end up paying more with John.
* **Time is a factor:** You have 10 rounds, and pushing further could waste time and potentially lead to a worse outcome.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $87.50 is the most sensible choice at this point, balancing price and potential risk."
