"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000, as I mentioned earlier. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to consider buying from John for $800000 if we can't come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
