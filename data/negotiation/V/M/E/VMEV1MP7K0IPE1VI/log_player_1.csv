Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. I'm still unable to go above $1,000,000.  I'm willing to close the deal right now at this price, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge from his $1,000,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids further time wasted."
