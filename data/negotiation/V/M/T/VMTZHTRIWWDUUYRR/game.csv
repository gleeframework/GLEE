"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,500, as it's below my minimum price of $8,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,500. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business.",8500.0,Alice,3,,
