"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and it's worth trying to negotiate further.  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a higher price, and it's worth trying to negotiate further before settling for $950,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued interest in the product. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum threshold.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $990000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.
