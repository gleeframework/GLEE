Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while ensuring a profit.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000) creates a strong negotiating position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed to invite discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value. The offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If there's time pressure, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing to secure the deal quickly."
