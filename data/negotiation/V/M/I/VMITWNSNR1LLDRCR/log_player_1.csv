"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiating by asking for his thoughts.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. There's still room to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Strategic advantage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price in the next round. 

**Next steps:** I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a compromise that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $18,000 to $16,000, demonstrating a desire for a deal. 
* **Still above minimum:** $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving some room for potential further negotiation.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the need for a fair compromise to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Can we consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the most advantageous option. 
* **Controlling the negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially get a better price in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget.  How about we split the difference at $14,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's in between our last two offers. 
* **Almost at my minimum:** $14,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to incentivize him to accept.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed. I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short. How about we try $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is only $1,500 below my minimum acceptable price, I've been through several rounds and haven't been able to secure a deal at a price closer to my value.
* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations and getting a lower offer outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable sale. 

**Conclusion:** 

Selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision at this point. The risk of continuing with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer or no offer at all is too high, and I can guarantee a good profit by selling to John."
