"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer significantly above Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high price without being aggressive.
* **Open to Discussion:** We signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob's input and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to understand his negotiation style and potential price ceiling.
3. **Maximize Profit:**  Strive for a final price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in exploring a deal, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $600,000. This offer takes into account my budget and perceived value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

While his offer is far from ideal, it confirms his interest in the product. We have room to negotiate upwards, especially since we know he values it at a higher price. 

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, but we can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob. We'll use our next counteroffer to bridge the gap and steer the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's unique worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession from our initial price ($1,300,000 to $1,100,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer remains well above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Justification:** We're still emphasizing the product's unique worth to justify the higher price point.
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By making a considerable move, we're prompting Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to a mutually agreeable range. 

We'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While that price is better, it's still a bit high for me. How about we try to meet in the middle? I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I hope this demonstrates my seriousness about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards his perceived value, which indicates he's interested. However, $700,000 is still significantly below our $1,000,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. 

While we could take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, we're making progress with Bob. There's a good chance we can negotiate a price closer to our target. We'll continue with another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm also serious about getting this deal done. How about we meet halfway between our last offers? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This demonstrates a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By proposing $950,000 (exactly between $700,000 and $1,100,000), we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a fair solution. This tactic often resonates well in negotiations.
* **Above Minimum, Below Perceived Value:** This price point keeps us comfortably above our $1,000,000 minimum while remaining below Bob's $800,000 perceived value. There's potential for him to accept or make a counteroffer within this range.
* **Reinforcing Value:** We continue to highlight the product's value to justify the price, even though we're making concessions. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, we need to guide the negotiation towards a close.  This offer keeps a sense of urgency while still allowing for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving your price. I'm willing to go up a bit more to $750,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $750,000 is still too low. While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, we need to hold firm to push him closer to our minimum. Accepting now would mean a $250,000 loss compared to selling to John. 

We have four rounds remaining, and Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation. We'll continue with a counteroffer, but we'll also start highlighting the value of the product more strongly to justify a higher price and potentially speed up the process."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your willingness to move on the price.  To be transparent, this product offers significant untapped potential that I believe you haven't fully factored into your valuation.  It's truly unique in the market. To reflect its true worth and to meet you halfway, I'm proposing $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the long-term value this product represents."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlighting Value:**  We're shifting the focus more strongly to the product's unique value and untapped potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify a higher price point.
* **Smaller Concession:**  Our price reduction is smaller this round ($950,000 to $900,000), signaling that we're approaching our limit.
* **Urgency and Fairness:**  We reiterate our desire for a deal while emphasizing the fairness of the offer. This combination of urgency and value justification aims to encourage Bob to move closer to our desired outcome.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  With time running out, we're positioning ourselves strategically. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two, we may need to consider accepting his best offer or moving on to John to secure the $1,000,000."
