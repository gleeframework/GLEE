"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in exploring a deal, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $600,000. This offer takes into account my budget and perceived value of the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's unique worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While that price is better, it's still a bit high for me. How about we try to meet in the middle? I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I hope this demonstrates my seriousness about making a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm also serious about getting this deal done. How about we meet halfway between our last offers? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This demonstrates a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your willingness to move on the price.  To be transparent, this product offers significant untapped potential that I believe you haven't fully factored into your valuation.  It's truly unique in the market. To reflect its true worth and to meet you halfway, I'm proposing $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the long-term value this product represents.",900000.0,Alice,7,
