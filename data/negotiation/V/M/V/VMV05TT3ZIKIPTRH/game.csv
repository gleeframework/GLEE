"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $17,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be realistic about my minimum acceptable price. $9,500 is simply not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering both our needs. Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about what I can accept. $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  I'm ready to close this deal, but if it doesn't work out, I have another buyer lined up.",11500.0,Alice,7,
