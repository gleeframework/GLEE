"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could find elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I'd like to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further.",13000.0,Alice,5,
