{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm starting the negotiations with a price of $1,800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to explore my options further before settling."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,500,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, reflecting the unique value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our conversation and the value of the product. My revised counteroffer is $1600000. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,600,000 is a good price and it seems like Bob is serious about buying.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in the next few rounds, and it's not worth risking it."
