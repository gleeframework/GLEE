This offer gives Bob a good deal while still ensuring you get a significant profit. It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to get as close to $1,400,000 as possible. This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer and it's still a significant profit for me.  Accepting this offer is the best choice, as trying to squeeze out another $30,000 might risk losing the deal altogether."
