Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's something you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target High, but be Realistic:**  Starting at a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) is ideal, but going too high might scare him off. $12,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer acknowledges Bob's potential interest and leaves the door open for counter-offers. This flexibility increases the chance of closing a deal above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Alice has the security of John's offer ($8,000). This knowledge allows her to aim higher with Bob without the fear of being left empty-handed."
