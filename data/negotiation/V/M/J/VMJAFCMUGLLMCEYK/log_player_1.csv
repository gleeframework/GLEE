"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's room for both of us to compromise and find a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible within the 10 rounds. I'll be adjusting my offers based on Bob's responses. If he rejects, I'll lower the price slightly. If he accepts, I'll be happy with the deal. If the negotiation goes on for too long or if he keeps making counteroffers that are too low, I'll switch to John, who's guaranteed to pay my minimum price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are still 8 rounds left. I believe I can still get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer. I'll try to find a middle ground. 
* **Monitoring the rounds:** I'll keep track of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the negotiation drags on for too long or if Bob keeps making unreasonably low counteroffers, I'll switch to John to secure the guaranteed $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's counteroffer ($95). 
* **Positive and encouraging language:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the benefits for both of us. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for some give and take. I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding the middle ground:** By making a counter-offer in the middle, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining control:** I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward while staying firm on my desired price range. 
* **Monitoring the situation:** I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly.  If we don't reach an agreement within a few more rounds, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired price:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $100 is still lower than what I am aiming for. 
* **Room for improvement:** I believe we can reach a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer with a slight adjustment:** I will offer a slightly higher price than Bob's counteroffer in the next round, potentially around $103-$105, to see if we can come to an agreement.
* **Remaining rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I'll be more cautious about making too many concessions. If the negotiation drags on or if Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum acceptable price, I will sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. How about $103? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 103}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly higher counter-offer:** I'm offering a price that's just a little higher than Bob's last offer, signaling my willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that this offer is a good compromise for both of us.
* **Encouraging finalization:** I'm suggesting that we can finalize the deal if he accepts this offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to accept a price closer to my desired range.
* **Remaining rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to move closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Prepared for a switch:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my options and potentially start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I would like to propose $102 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close enough:**  Bob's offer of $102 is only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $103. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic and consider that I may not be able to get a better price.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale for a decent price. While I could try to counteroffer, the risk is that I might lose the deal altogether, and I'm not guaranteed a better offer from John.

**Strategy:**

* **Calculated risk:** I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting this offer. However, I've weighed the potential downsides and determined that accepting is the best option at this point.
* **Learning for future negotiations:**  I'll use this experience to learn how to better anticipate buyer behavior and adjust my negotiation tactics in future situations."
