"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, and allows us to work towards a mutually acceptable price.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and John is willing to pay my full asking price. This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my full asking price, so I'm not under pressure to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to this deal, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference.  I'll come down to $11,500. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds dwindle, I'm still not willing to accept $10,500. It's too far from my desired price, and John is still a viable option.  I have four rounds left to try and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but I can't go any lower than $11,000. This is a fair price for the product, and it's the best I can do. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
I'm sticking to my previous offer, but emphasizing that it's my final offer. This adds a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm willing to risk it as we're now down to just 3 rounds left."
