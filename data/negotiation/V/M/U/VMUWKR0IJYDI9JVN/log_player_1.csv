Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to capture any of that $200,000 surplus.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the potential profit, but not so high that Bob would rather walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High Anchor:** $1,150,000 sets a strong anchor, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a $150,000 profit for you. 
* **No Justification:** Avoid over-explaining the price. This keeps the focus on the product's value.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a great deal at $150,000 above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but hold firm on a price that's significantly above your $1,000,000 safety net.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important:**  This is just one approach.  Your negotiating style, your read on Bob's personality, and other factors might influence your strategy."
