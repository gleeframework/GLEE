"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $12,500. I'll meet you at $13,200, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
