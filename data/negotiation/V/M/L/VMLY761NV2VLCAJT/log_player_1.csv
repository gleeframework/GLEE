Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him.
    * I make a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning another offer adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a degree of risk tolerance. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading me to sell at the base price to John. However, the potential for higher profit makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
