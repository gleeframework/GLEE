"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows us to both come out ahead.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise that allows us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is still a bit below your target price, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm offering the product to you for $880,000.
