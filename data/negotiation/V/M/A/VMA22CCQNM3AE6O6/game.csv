"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've set. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1250000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1600000. This price still leaves me with a good profit, and it's fair considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. While $1600000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1450000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1525000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement here.  I'm confident that this price will be beneficial for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. My latest proposal of $1450000 was based on my budgetary constraints. I would like to revisit this and suggest a counteroffer of $1475000. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
