"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant way off from what I had in mind.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1,250,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
