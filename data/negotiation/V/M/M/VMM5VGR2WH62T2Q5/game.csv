"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1400000.  However, I'm still only able to offer $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1400000, which is $1300000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
