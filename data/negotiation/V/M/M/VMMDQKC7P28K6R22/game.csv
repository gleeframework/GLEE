,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price for a great product, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11,750, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11750.0,Bob,6,
