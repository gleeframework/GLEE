"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm confident it's something you'll find valuable as well. I'm starting the offer at $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate its value, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. How about we start at $5000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $5000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. How about $12500? This is still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $7500 would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $7500 is still not close to what this product is worth to me. How about we split the difference and go with $10000? It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
