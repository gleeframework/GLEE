"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is above my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a higher price, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 102.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $97.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $97.5 is close to my minimum, and we're already at round 4. I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
