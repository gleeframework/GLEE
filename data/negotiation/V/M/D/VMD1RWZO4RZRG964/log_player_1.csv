Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering your asking price and my financial constraints.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and it's getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. John's offer guarantees I get my minimum."
