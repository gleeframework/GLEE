"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
