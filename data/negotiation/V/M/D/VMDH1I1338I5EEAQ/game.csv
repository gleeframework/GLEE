"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1250000 is still not enough for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a little further to $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1600000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. $1400000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers and shows my willingness to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1550000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of your product and my commitment to acquiring it.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
