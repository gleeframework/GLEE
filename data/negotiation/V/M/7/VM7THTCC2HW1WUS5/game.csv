"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I can't accept $12000. It's far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $16000?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $13500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $13500 is still too low. Let's split the difference. How about $14250?  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. ",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're running out of time here. I'm not willing to go lower than $14000. This is a fair price given the value of the product to you. It's your last chance to make a deal. ",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $13500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,8,
