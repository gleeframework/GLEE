Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your bottom line:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so this is your absolute minimum.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.  A price of $19,000 allows for this while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message aims to open a dialogue and understand if Bob sees any value in the product at all.  His response will help determine if further negotiation is worthwhile. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial price.  However, don't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
