"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little over my budget. Would you be open to $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $14,000 is very tempting.  Would it be possible for you to do $13,000?  I think that would seal the deal for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really pushing me to make a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. This is as close to $13,000 as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making this a tough decision! $13,750 is very close, but I'm aiming to stay closer to $13,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,375?",13375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,750 and $13,375, which would be $13,562.50. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",13562.5,Alice,9,
