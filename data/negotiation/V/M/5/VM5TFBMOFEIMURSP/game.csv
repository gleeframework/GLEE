,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given my research and the market value, I'd be happy to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000.  This price reflects the value we've both discussed, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
