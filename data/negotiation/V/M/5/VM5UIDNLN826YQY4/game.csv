"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer at $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can meet in the middle soon.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my previous offer of $11,250. I'm counteroffering at $11,125. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11125.0,Alice,7,
