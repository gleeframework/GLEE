Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I think it would be a great fit for you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested, getting you closer to your ideal price.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like a good deal for Bob while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob with the security of knowing John will purchase it at a price that meets your minimum."
