# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a great price considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high above her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice or you can buy it from John for $15,000."
