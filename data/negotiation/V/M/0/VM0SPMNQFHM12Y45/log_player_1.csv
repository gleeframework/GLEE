Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a good middle ground that respects both our needs.  What do you say?
