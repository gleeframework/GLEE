"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested buyers.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too much for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. I believe it's a fair offer considering John is also selling a similar product. Let me know if you're open to it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
