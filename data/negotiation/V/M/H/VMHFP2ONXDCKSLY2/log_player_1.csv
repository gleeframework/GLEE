Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested buyers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too much for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. I believe it's a fair offer considering John is also selling a similar product. Let me know if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation:

While Bob is now offering his maximum value, it's still significantly less than what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a low chance of reaching a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible price for Alice right now."
