Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  His offers are decreasing in smaller increments, suggesting he's reaching his upper limit. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
