"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to make a serious offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price,  demonstrating his desire to get a good deal.  $8,500 is still within his budget and is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $9,500 for now. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he is willing to compromise, but is still trying to get the best deal.  A counteroffer of $9,000 shows a willingness to meet halfway, but it still gives him some room to negotiate in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $9,250. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is a fair price for Bob, considering his target price is $12,000.  It's better than his counteroffer of $9,000 and leaves him with enough room to potentially profit if he resells the product later. It's also a good price compared to buying from John at $12,000.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
