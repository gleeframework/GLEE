"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,100,000, reflecting its unique value and potential. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'd counter with $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and still leaves room for you to benefit from this incredible opportunity. Let's keep talking to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $912,500.  This would allow us both to achieve a fair outcome and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I respect your position.  However, I need to stick to my budget. My final offer is $890,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider my other options.",890000.0,Bob,6,
