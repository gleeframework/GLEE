Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that your offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $120 offer, ensuring you prioritize the more profitable sale."
