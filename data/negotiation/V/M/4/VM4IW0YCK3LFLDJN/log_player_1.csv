Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring the deal is still very appealing to you.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your $800,000 minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price seem justified.
* **Urgency:** Adding a touch of urgency (""limited-time offer"") encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
