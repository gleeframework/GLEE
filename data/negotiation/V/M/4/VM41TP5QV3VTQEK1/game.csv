"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about we split the difference at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a little too low. Let's meet in the middle at $91.25. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at $91.25.  How about we settle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",89.0,Bob,6,
