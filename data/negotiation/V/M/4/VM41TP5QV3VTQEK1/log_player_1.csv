Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about we split the difference at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a little too low. Let's meet in the middle at $91.25. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at $91.25.  How about we settle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $89 is still a little below my minimum desired price.  I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiations and haven't been able to secure a price that's both fair and profitable for me. To avoid wasting any more time, I'm going to accept John's offer of $120.  It's a better outcome than selling to Bob at a lower price."
