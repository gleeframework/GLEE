``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $80, and Alice is asking for $100.

* **Start with your maximum:**  You've already stated your top price, and this establishes your boundaries. 
* **Be polite:**  Even though you're pushing for a lower price, maintaining a friendly tone can help keep the negotiation going.
* **Leave room for compromise:** While $80 is your ideal price, it's possible you might need to budge a bit."

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I can go. How about we split the difference at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 87.50}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a little too low. Let's meet in the middle at $91.25. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at $91.25.  How about we settle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to your limit:**  You're getting closer to your maximum price of $80, but there's still some room to negotiate.
