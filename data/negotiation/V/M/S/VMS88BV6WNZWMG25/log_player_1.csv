Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000**, as selling to John guarantees this amount. 
* **I'm aiming for a higher profit**, so I'm offering the product to Bob at $1,500,000. 
* This gives Bob a potential incentive to buy, as he may value the product higher than $1,500,000.

**It's a gamble:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I earn a significant profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I still get my minimum acceptable price by selling to John. 

This approach balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a higher profit."
