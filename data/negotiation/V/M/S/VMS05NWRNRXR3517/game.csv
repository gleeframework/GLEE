"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I can offer $850000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1050000, which is a 10% discount from my original asking price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I'm willing to give up.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that high. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm willing to offer $900000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a challenging price for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $980000, which is a 3.5% discount from my original asking price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I'm willing to give up. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $980000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925000. This reflects a considerable effort on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925000 is a tough pill to swallow, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $970000, which is a 5% discount from my original asking price. This is my final and best offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Alice,9,
