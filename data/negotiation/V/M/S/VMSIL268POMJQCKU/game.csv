"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your value for the product and my budget, I'd like to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our previous offers and aims to be fair to both parties.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This seems like a fair price given our previous offers and the product's value to both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to offer the product at $8,900. I hope this price aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",8900.0,Alice,5,
