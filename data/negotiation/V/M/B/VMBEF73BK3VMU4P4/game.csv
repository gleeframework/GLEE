,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  $85 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
