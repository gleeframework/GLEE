"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this work for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. Would you consider an offer of $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250 as a final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll agree.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is the price I was originally considering. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
