# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I propose a fair offer of $13,000 for this item. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring that you receive a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay (his limit is $15,000).
* Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is his maximum price.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to minimize cost."
