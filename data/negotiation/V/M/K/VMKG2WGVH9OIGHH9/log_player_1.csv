Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $10,000 is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and my openness to negotiation.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence to walk away if Bob's offers aren't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $8500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  I won't sell below $8,000, so Bob's offer of $8,500 is still within my acceptable range.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob. He's already shown interest and expressed willingness to pay a higher price than John. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could sell to John now, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob, making the potential for a higher price worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $9,500 for this product. It really is something special, and I think it's worth that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is closer to Bob's initial offer while still being above my minimum selling point.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the price. 
* **Openness to Further Discussion:** My message maintains a friendly and open tone, suggesting further negotiation is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I can only offer $9000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out an extra $500, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $8,000.  
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation could be time-consuming. Accepting Bob's offer is a quick and reasonable solution."
