"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and my maximum price.  It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This price still allows for a substantial gain for you, while also being fair for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $1,025,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $850,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is a bit further than I'm comfortable going right now. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a significant price, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately at that amount."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe $950,000 is a fair price that reflects its value. It's a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will yield excellent returns. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
