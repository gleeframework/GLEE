Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I believe I can't justify the price of $12000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $11500 is slightly out of my budget. Could we possibly meet at $11000? This would allow me to purchase the product without straining my finances too much.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe that $11250 might be a bit high for me. I am willing to pay up to $11000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",11000.0,Bob,6,
