"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $13750. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $13750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with $13250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",13250.0,Alice,7,
