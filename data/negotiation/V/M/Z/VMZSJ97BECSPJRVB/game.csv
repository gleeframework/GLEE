"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is higher than I'm currently able to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This represents a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to getting a good price for the product.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a substantial difference from what I had in mind. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,5,
