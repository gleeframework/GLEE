Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product at this price, but I'm also open to a counteroffer if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $105 is still a little low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 is a bit closer, but I'm aiming for something below $110.  Would you do $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is offering $108, which is only $2 away from my minimum price of $100. While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away completely. It's better to secure the sale at this price than risk losing him and being forced to sell to John for $100."
