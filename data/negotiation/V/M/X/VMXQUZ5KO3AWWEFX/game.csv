"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, but I'm still trying to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $8,750?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
