"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice or from John, so there's no reason to accept this offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, but I'm still trying to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge further before committing to the $12,000 purchase from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should buy from John. At this point, Alice is unwilling to come down below $9,500, which is more than Bob is willing to pay. He's already stated his willingness to pay $8,750 and she rejected that offer.  John is offering the product for $12,000, but it's still cheaper than Alice's offer. It's time for Bob to move on and save money."
