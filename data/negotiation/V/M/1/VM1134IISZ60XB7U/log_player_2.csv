"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to minimize his cost, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. There's potential to get the price even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking $1,320,000 is a fair price. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good spot for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,325,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might be risky. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John. Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase for a price that's significantly lower than John's, and it's only slightly more than Bob's last counteroffer."
