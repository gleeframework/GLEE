"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $105 as my offer for the product. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",107.5,Alice,5,
