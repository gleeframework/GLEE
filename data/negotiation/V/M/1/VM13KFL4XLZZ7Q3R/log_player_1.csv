Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. I'm willing to sell to John for $100, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $105 is closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get closer to my desired $110. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
