"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to consider your counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
