Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my minimum price to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $825,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $800,000?

This is the best option for several reasons:

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has explicitly stated that $800,000 is her absolute minimum.  Trying to push further is unlikely to be successful and might make her walk away.
* **Significant Savings:** You are securing a $200,000 discount from your maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is a risk. There's no guarantee of a better deal, and you might miss out on using the product sooner."
