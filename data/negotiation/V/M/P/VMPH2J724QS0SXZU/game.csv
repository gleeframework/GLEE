"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider something around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my minimum price to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $825,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $825,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $800,000? It's my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
