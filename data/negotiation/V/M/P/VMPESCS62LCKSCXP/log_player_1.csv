Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good value. "", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher.  How about $102? It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me."", ""product_price"": 102}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've looked into the product further and I believe $100 is a fair price. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $100 is getting very close and I've already rejected him a few times. It's getting risky to keep rejecting, as I'm nearing my limit of rounds and I could end up selling to John for $120, which is less than what I'd get from Bob. Accepting now will secure a profit and ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
