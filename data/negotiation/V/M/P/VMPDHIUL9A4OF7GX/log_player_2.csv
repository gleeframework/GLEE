# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring if Alice will go lower before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit low considering the value it holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice.  $11,500 is still too high, but Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. It's worth exploring if Bob can get closer to his target price before considering John's offer."
