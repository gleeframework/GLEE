"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product *is*.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language used aims to be collaborative (""mutually beneficial agreement""), signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 

This strategy helps me understand Bob's position better in the initial rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim to meet closer to the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000, moving closer to Bob's offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Justification:** The message frames this as finding a ""middle ground"" and still emphasizes the product's ""true potential.""
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and if a deal within my desired range is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is now above my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially push for more in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Become less willing to negotiate.
* Walk away from the deal entirely. 

Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
