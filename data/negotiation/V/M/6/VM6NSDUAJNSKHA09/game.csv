"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950000. Would you be open to discussing that?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
