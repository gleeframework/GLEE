I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to understand Bob's potential value for the product and adjust accordingly."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm offering $9,750.  This is a compromise,  showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.  I believe this price is fair and increases the chances of a deal."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's a little lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal and above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm willing to take the $9,600 and move on."
