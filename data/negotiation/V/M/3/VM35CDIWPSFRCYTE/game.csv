"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Given the product's value to me and your desired sale, I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still beyond my current budget.  I'm willing to go to $825,000. This is a fair price considering we're both making concessions, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I see we're both committed to making this deal work. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value to us both. Let's close this deal now.",850000.0,Bob,8,
