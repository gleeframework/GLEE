"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $18000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $13000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible!  I'm still a bit above my budget at $16000.  Would you be willing to come down to $14000? That's a good middle ground for us both, and I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer the product to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
