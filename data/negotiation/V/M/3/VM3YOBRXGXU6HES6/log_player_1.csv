"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is fair considering its value. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $150 is really pushing it. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $100. It's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Reason:  Bob is firmly rooted at $100.  There is no indication he'll move, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Taking John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
