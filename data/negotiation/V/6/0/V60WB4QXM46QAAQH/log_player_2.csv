"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John. This means you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer starts the negotiation process and allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (25%) shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating. This gives you room to maneuver in subsequent rounds if she counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. You have multiple rounds left, and  a counteroffer could potentially get you closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable step towards a potential agreement, and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
