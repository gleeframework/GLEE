Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. This strategy is based on the hope that Bob values the product highly and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While selling to John for $12,000 is a viable option, I'm going to try and negotiate with Bob further. There's still a chance he might be willing to pay closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still higher than my minimum but shows some flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay while still securing a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price of $12,000.  This is a good deal for me, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer more. Accepting his offer ensures I sell the product for my minimum acceptable price."
