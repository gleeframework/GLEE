"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a cheaper price from Alice, so rejecting her offer makes sense.  He can then try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price than $9,000. While Alice has come down a bit, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is at her lowest point.  At $9,200, Bob is still getting a significant discount compared to John's price of $12,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
