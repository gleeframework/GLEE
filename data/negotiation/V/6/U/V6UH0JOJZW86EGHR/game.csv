"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
