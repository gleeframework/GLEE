"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds tremendous value for you.  I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, you have a better alternative: buying from John for $800,000. This saves you $100,000."
