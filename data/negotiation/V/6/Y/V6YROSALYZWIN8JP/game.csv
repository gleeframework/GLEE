"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
