"Alice,  $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand the value you place on this product, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer you $15,000. It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
