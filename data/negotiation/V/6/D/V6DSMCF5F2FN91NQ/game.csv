,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm proposing $1,125,000. This compromise allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,112,500. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,112,500 is closer, but it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,118,750. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1118750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still discussing the terms. However, $1,118,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,106,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to move forward with this offer.",1106250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,106,250 simply doesn't reflect the value I've placed on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer it for $1,112,500. It's a fair compromise that allows us to finalize this deal without further negotiation.

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $1,105,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1105000.0,Bob,8,
