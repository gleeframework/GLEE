"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer Alice.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so he shouldn't pay more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to pay more. He should try to counteroffer Alice again to see if he can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,235,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has come down to $1,235,000, but that's still more than what Bob can get from John. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point."
