"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11500? It's a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I was thinking we could even go a bit lower to make it a great deal for both of us. How about $11200? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to make the sale happen.",11200.0,Alice,5,
