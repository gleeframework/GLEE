Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I think you'd be very interested in. It's in excellent condition and I'm asking for [Product Price]. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've tried to keep the message concise and friendly, highlighting the product's value while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Product Price:** I've chosen a price of $15,000. This is a higher price point, but it allows for potential negotiation while ensuring that I make a profit above my minimum threshold.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By offering a higher price, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to buy. If he rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer of $12,000, guaranteeing a profit."
