Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation if Bob is willing to counter-offer.  If Bob rejects my offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $1,000 less than my initial offer, and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It's not my ideal price, but I'm willing to accept it as it's a good deal overall.  I'd rather secure a sale and earn $9,000 than risk losing Bob and having to settle for $8,000 from John."
