Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that might interest you for $120. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** You know the product is worth $100 to you, and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John). 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Profit Potential:**  There's a chance Bob might pay a bit more than his perceived value, especially if you present it well. 
* **Starting High:** By starting at $120, you leave room for negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you could potentially meet in the middle. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure a sale, you could offer a lower price initially."
