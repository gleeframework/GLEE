"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice claims the product is worth $10,000 to you, you've stated your maximum value is $10,000.  Her offer of $9,000 is within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a good deal for both parties.** Alice is getting $9,000 for something worth $8,000 to her, and you're getting a good deal at $9,000."
