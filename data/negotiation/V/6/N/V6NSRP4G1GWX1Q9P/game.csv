"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this works for you!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about $750,000? That's a significant move on my part.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're making a significant move with your offer of $750,000. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you!",825000.0,Alice,5,
