"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's starting offer is too high. I know I can get it for $800,000 from John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this works for you!

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my fallback price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm ready to buy from John if needed."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're making a significant move with your offer of $750,000. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'll take John's offer of $800,000."
