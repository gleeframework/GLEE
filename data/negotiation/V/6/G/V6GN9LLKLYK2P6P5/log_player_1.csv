Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A price of $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significant profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above your $1,000,000 baseline."
