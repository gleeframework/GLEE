"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price that I believe is a fair compromise. Would you be interested in buying it for $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as you might get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $15,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price point of $10,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better deal. You might be able to get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,500 is a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,000.  I'm really serious about getting this product and believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above your budget of $10,000. While it's getting closer, it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more agreeable price.  You might be able to convince Alice to come down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to $12,000. How about we settle on $12,250? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $12,250 and $13,500, which would be $12,875. However, I'm also keeping an eye on the market and may need to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tedious. Alice's offer is still above your budget, and even though she's getting closer, it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to reach a price you're comfortable with. Given that you have a guaranteed alternative with John, it's more strategic to purchase from him at $10,000 and avoid the further risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer. You'll save time and ensure you get the product at your maximum price point."
