"I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $15,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,500 is a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,000.  I'm really serious about getting this product and believe this price would be fair for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to $12,000. How about we settle on $12,250? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $12,250 and $13,500, which would be $12,875. However, I'm also keeping an eye on the market and may need to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement soon.",12875.0,Alice,7,
