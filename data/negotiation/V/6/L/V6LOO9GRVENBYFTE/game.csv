"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  This is a really great product, and I think it's worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $85? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
