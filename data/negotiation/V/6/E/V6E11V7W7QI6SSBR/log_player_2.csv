"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. He knows Alice's minimum is $10,000, so he starts with a counteroffer of $10,500.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  While this is a slightly better offer than the initial $12,000, it's still not within Bob's budget.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to Alice's minimum price. He increases his counteroffer by $500 to $11,000.  This shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  There's still room for negotiation and a chance to get a price closer to his desired range.  Bob should reject the offer and continue trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer while still keeping it under his maximum value of $15,000. By offering $11,500, Bob shows Alice that he's willing to meet her halfway and potentially close the deal.  This also leaves room for a slight counteroffer from Alice if she's willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired range, it's still above his maximum value of $15,000. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.  Bob needs to make a decisive move.

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for $15,000, which is within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome. It's a safer option in this situation, as it ensures Bob gets the product within his desired price range."
