"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering it's worth $100 to him and $80 to me. It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is a good price, considering I can always sell to John for $80. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
