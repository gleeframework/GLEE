"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $20000. I'm confident it's worth every penny, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to accept $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to move forward.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11000 is a good offer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would allow us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $10500. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finally close the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10500.  That's a good offer, but I'm still trying to manage my budget.  Would you consider $9750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the sale with only one round left.",9750.0,Bob,8,
