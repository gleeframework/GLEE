Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you're in a strong position. The goal is to see if you can get Bob to pay more than his perceived value, but less than or equal to yours.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You project value and scarcity.
* **Strong Price:**  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down a bit.
* **Time Limit:** Creates urgency for Bob to decide.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might start a bit lower, but still above his $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to counter-offer if Bob tries to negotiate down. You hold a strong position with your backup offer.
