"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its exceptional quality and features, I believe it's worth more than its actual cost. Let's start with an offer of $20000 for the product.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to this price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Based on the value I place on the product and considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $10000. It's the most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not comfortable going any higher.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I respect your budgetary constraints. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $12000 for the product. This is the highest price I can lower it to while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my offer of $10000. It's the absolute limit of my budget, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After reviewing the situation again, I am willing to lower the price to $11000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for myself. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the product for my maximum limit of $10000. I'm confident that we can find a way to make this work for both of us. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
