"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget.  It's wise to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $15,000 is still too high for Bob.  He should reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's a good chance he can get a lower price closer to his limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.

I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not comfortable going any higher."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, Bob is still determined to try and get the product for $10,000. He's only a few rounds away from being able to buy it from John for that price, so he's not willing to give in yet."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my offer of $10,000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is still very close to his goal of getting the product for $10,000. He's only got one round left before he can buy it from John, and he doesn't want to pay an extra $500 if he can avoid it. It's worth risking one more round to try and get a better deal from Alice."
