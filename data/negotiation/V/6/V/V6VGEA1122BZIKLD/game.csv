"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is worth every penny. That being said, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000 yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,020,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy today if the price is right.  To be frank, $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $985,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us, and we can wrap this up today.",985000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $985,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1,015,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're running out of time and I need to be decisive.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to pursue other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
