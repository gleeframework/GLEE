"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $119. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $120 to you, Alice's offer of $119 is still within your budget and saves you $1 compared to buying from John.  It's a better deal than the alternative."
