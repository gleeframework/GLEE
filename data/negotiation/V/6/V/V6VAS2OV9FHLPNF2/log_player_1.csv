Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while also allowing me to potentially make a profit.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and then decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I believe this price is a good middle ground, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting close to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the next round.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale than to risk getting nothing at all."
