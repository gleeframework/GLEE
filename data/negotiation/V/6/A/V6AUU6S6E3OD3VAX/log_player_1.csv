Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to the offer. 
* **No Pressure:** I'm not pressuring Bob to make a decision immediately, giving him space to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm also aware that Bob might have a lower idea of the product's value.  By being open to negotiation and leaving room for counteroffers, I can still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  The option to sell to John for $80 acts as a safety net, ensuring I don't lose out entirely if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is a good compromise, considering my initial offer of $100.  Accepting his offer means a quick sale and a good profit, especially considering that selling to John would only yield $80.

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale at a price I'm happy with, ensuring I don't waste time and effort with potentially fruitless negotiations."
