"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way, we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $88? This would be a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $88 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $90.  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
