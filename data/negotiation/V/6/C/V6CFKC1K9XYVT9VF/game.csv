"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,325,000. This is a fair price that shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,
