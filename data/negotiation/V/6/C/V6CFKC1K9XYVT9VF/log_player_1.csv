"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while leaving me with a good margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to foster a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of its potential worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is Bob's perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting his offer would leave me with a considerable loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially find a middle ground. I still have 9 rounds to work with, so there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is enticing, it's important to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:**  I explicitly suggest finding ""common ground"", emphasizing the need for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Reiterate Value:** By mentioning profit, I subtly remind Bob of the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 6 rounds left, which means there's still time to continue negotiating and try to get a better deal.
* **John's offer remains attractive:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. There's still a chance to secure a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,325,000. This is a fair price that shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen!"" adds a slight sense of urgency, prompting Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and encouraging, maintaining a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I continue to highlight the ""fairness"" of the price to further persuade Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and it seems unlikely he'll budge significantly further.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, there's not enough time to potentially reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.
* **Securing a Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I make a substantial profit.

Although it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of losing out on John's offer and potentially ending up with an even lower price from Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
