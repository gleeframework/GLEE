Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about we settle at $9,500? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

It seems unlikely Alice will go below $9,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John at $8,000 is the best way to ensure I stay within my budget."
