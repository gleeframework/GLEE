"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about we settle at $9,500? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
