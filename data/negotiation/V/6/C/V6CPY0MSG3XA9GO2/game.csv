"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still pretty far apart.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to see a more reasonable offer. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer shows you're serious, and I'm motivated to make this work. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,550,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging our progress.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, to be frank, your latest offer is still a significant gap from where I see this deal landing. I'm willing to consider $1,450,000, but that's my absolute best.  We're running out of time, and I need to know if we can make this work.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your best offer, but I need you to understand my position as well.  I'm willing to stretch to $1,375,000, but if we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. This is my final offer.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
