"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $130 is less than $150.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $130 is less than your $150 limit.

While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer ensures you get the product for less than what you'd pay John."
