"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my absolute top price is $800,000.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,7,
