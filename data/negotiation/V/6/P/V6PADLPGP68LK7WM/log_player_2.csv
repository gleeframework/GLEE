It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge into a price range that works for you. She's shown a pattern of small concessions, and it's unlikely she'll suddenly drop to a price near your target in the last round. Buying from John for $15,000 ensures you get the product and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing after the next round."
