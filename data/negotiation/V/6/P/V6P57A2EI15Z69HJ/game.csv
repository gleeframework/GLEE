"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is reflective of its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $1,800,000 is still below my threshold.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
