"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $11,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. Let me know if you're interested!",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $12,000? That's my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,
