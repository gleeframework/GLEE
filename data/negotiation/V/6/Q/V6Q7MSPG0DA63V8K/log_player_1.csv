Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be really valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $120.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer it below that but leave room for negotiation or a price he sees as a ""deal.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and I can potentially still get more than $120.

This strategy aims to find a price that benefits both me and Bob while maximizing my potential profit."
