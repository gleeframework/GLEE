Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, your goal is to maximize profit.  Therefore, you should try to get a price higher than $1,000,000 from Bob if possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle on a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:**  The message focuses on the potential benefits for Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no time pressure. If you need to sell the product quickly, you might offer it to Bob closer to $1,000,000 to secure a fast sale.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown.  A more aggressive approach might involve a higher initial offer."
