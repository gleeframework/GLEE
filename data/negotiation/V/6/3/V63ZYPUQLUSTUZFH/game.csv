"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but only to $825,000.  This offer is still a great value for you, and allows us to finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, which is right in the middle of my previous offer and your last one. Can we meet at this price?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price is still a good value for you and allows us to reach a final agreement.",800000.0,Alice,7,
