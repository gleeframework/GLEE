"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept the first offer.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a strong starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  It's important to note that this is just a starting point. Bob will adjust his counteroffers based on Alice's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $14,500 is still higher than his desired price point.  He'll continue to counteroffer to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price below Alice's last offer. This strategy demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product while maintaining a firm stance on his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While Bob can continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially increasing her price again exists.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to ensure a purchase and save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
