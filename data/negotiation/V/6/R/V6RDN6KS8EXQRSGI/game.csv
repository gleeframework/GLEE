"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While $1,600,000 represents the upper end of the product's value, I understand your perspective.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
