"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is a fair price considering it's closer to your valuation of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
