Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $850,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has gone as low as she likely will.  She's at her value point and further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings.  This is a good deal compared to John's offer."
