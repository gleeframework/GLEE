,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $875,000, which would be $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.
