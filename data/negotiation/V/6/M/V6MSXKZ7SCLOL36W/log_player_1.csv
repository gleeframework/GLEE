Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, I'll start by offering it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say... $85.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $75. Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to the true value of the product.

Let's say... I'll offer Bob $78.
