"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's a valuable asset that holds significant worth to me, and I believe it would be equally beneficial to you. Considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I am extending an offer to sell it to you at a special price of $14,000. This is a fantastic deal, as it's well above the minimum value you perceive at $12,000 and below my asking price. I trust this proposal will meet your expectations and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
