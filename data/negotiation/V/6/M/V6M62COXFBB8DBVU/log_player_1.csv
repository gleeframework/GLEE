I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, but I want to try and push for more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price slightly from my initial offer, but still try to stay above Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer, and we're already four rounds in.  I think it's time to secure the deal and take the profit."
