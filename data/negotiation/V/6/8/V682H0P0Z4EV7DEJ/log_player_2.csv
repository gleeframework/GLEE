It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $100 is too high, and there are still 9 rounds to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm really hoping to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me. I'm determined to get the price lower. There are still 7 rounds left, and I can still get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still determined to get a better price.  While $92 is getting closer to my target,  I think I can get it down even further. I'm willing to take a few more rounds to get a deal that works for both of us."
