Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. Would you be interested in paying $11,000 for it?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  There's a $4,000 difference between your minimum price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John will pay $12,000 gives you a safety net. You don't need to sell to Bob if the price is too low.
* **The Offer:**  Offering $11,000 is a compromise. It's a decent discount for Bob and still allows you to earn more than your minimum.

**Important:** This is a strategic move, but there are no guarantees. Bob might still reject the offer.  You need to be prepared to accept his rejection and sell to John."
