"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, there's potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is in the middle of Alice's asking price and his own maximum budget. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also willing to negotiate. It is likely that Alice will be more willing to negotiate from this starting point rather than a much lower counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject future offers or the negotiation process will drag on. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further complications."
