"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $100, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
