Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob. 
* **High Anchor Price:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, making the price more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The slightly lower price than $1,000,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your desired profit.

By aiming high initially, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than her fallback option with John."
