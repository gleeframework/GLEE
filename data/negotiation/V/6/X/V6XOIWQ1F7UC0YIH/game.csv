"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, considering the value of the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll accept it.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it at that price.",11750.0,Alice,5,
