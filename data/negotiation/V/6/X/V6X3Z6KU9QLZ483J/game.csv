"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact for you. I'm confident it can generate far more value for your business.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground.  While $1,175,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,240,000? I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1240000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I understand it's a valuable product. To be honest, my budget limit is $1,200,000. If you can do that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  If not, I wish you all the best.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
