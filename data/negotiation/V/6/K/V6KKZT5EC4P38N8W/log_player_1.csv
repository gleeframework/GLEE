"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $14,000 is a fair starting point, as it's still below Bob's value for the product but leaves me with a profit above my minimum.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer. $13,500 is a good compromise, and I believe it's still within a reasonable range for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $12,000 and higher than what John is offering. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
