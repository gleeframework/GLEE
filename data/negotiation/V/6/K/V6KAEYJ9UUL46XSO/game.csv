"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find attractive. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
