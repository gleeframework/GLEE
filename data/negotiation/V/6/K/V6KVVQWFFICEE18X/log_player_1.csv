{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for me to go lower if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm letting Bob know I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. This subtle reminder adds pressure and could encourage Bob to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not a profitable deal for me. 
* **Potential for a Better Counter-Offer:** I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $875,000?  I'm confident this is still a fair deal, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain Profitability:** While $875,000 is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** I'm using John's offer as a benchmark to guide my negotiation. I'm not willing to drop below $875,000, as I'd rather accept John's offer at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget and am willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. This price aligns closely with the value I believe the product offers and remains within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob has moved closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a slightly higher offer, hoping to reach a deal closer to my target price.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  I'm not desperate for a deal. I have John's offer of $1,000,000, which is a more attractive option if I can't secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $860,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $870,000.

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $870,000 is again a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $875,000 and Bob's offer of $860,000. This shows continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $870,000 is still closer to my minimum of $1,000,000 than Bob's offer. This ensures I'm getting a more favorable deal. 
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** I'm using John's offer as a benchmark to guide my negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm likely to take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $865,000 for the product. This price is close to your last offer and remains within my financial limits.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $865,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a deal that meets my minimum. Bob is clearly committed to his budget, and I'm not willing to accept a loss.
* **John's Offer is the Best Option:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is the most profitable and secure option. It guarantees I reach my minimum desired price, and there's no risk of further negotiation."
