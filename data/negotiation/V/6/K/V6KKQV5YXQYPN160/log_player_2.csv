It's a good deal, but we can always try to get a better price.  Let's see if we can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

I'm going to try a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  $5,500 is still a fair price, but it leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now closer to my maximum price, and  I don't want to risk losing the product by pushing for a lower price. $6,000 is a good deal for both of us."
