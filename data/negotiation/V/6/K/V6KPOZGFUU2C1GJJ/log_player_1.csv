Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I want to get as close to that as possible.
* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:** I know I have a backup offer of $1,000,000 from John. This gives me confidence in setting a higher price with Bob.

By offering $1,400,000, I am aiming for a win-win situation:

* **Bob:** Saves $100,000 compared to his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Me:** Earn $400,000 more than my minimum desired price and get closer to the maximum value Bob is willing to pay. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the best possible price while still securing a sale if Bob declines."
