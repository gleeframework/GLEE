"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm aiming for the upper end of the value range since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $950,000 offer provides space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my target price and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm leaving so much value untapped. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to move closer to my range. I'm confident that we can reach a more agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm on my valuation while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to take it seriously.  
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to reinforce why my asking price is justified.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a favorable price:** Ideally, Bob will accept the $900,000. 
2. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** If he rejects this counteroffer, it indicates how much further he's willing to go.  

Based on Bob's response, I can decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. However, $875,000 is still below my psychological threshold, especially knowing I have the $800,000 backup from John. 

I'll make one more strategic counter-offer to test his resolve. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this simple: $890,000, and we have a deal. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.  I believe this price represents a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair:** I'm holding firm near my previous price point, signaling this is my bottom line.
* **Simplified Offer:** By removing the back-and-forth, I'm creating a sense of urgency and a clear path to closure.
* **Win-Win Framing:** Emphasizing the mutual benefits keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to agree.

**Outcome Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! I achieve a price significantly above my fallback option.
* **If Bob counters below $885,000:** I'll walk away and sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I don't leave too much money on the table by chasing a slightly higher offer from Bob.
* **If Bob counters close to $885,000:** This will require careful consideration, weighing potential profit against the remaining rounds and risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $880,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and has steadily increased his offer. While $880,000 is slightly below my ideal price, it's a strong offer considering:

* **Profit Margin:** It's still a $80,000 profit over my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation further increases the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Relationship:** Accepting this offer demonstrates goodwill and could lead to future opportunities with Bob.

Overall, accepting $880,000 represents a solid outcome at this stage of the negotiation."
