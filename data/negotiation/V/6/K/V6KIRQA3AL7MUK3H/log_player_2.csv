"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'd like to start with an offer of $9,200. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you since you value it at $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'll propose $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate and Alice has come down a bit.  There's still room for a better price.  Bob can counteroffer again and see if they can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This is a fair compromise and allows you to make a profit while still saving me some money."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $9,250. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. While he'd prefer to pay less, Alice has demonstrated she's unlikely to go lower. Accepting this offer will save Bob $750 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for both parties."
