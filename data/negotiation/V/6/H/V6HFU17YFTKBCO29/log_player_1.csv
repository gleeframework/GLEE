I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000 as it's below my minimum price. I'll see if I can reach a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I could do $1,200,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's final offer is my minimum price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm not sure if we can reach a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a secure outcome."
