"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I understand it holds great value for you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to let it go for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, however. How about $1,350,000?  This price still provides a good deal for you and allows me to receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a serious offer, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling a bit more flexible now, though. How about $1,300,000? This price is a fair compromise that takes into account your needs and my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,250,000. I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $1,200,000 might be a better option for me. Can you meet me at $1,250,000 or is this the best you can do?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
