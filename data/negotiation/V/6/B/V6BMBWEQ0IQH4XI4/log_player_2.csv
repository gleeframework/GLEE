"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $140.
* You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go below $145. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $145, which is still within your budget of $150. 
* Although you would ideally like to pay less, negotiating further might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
