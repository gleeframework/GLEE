"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $150, which is more than Alice's offer of $140. But since I can get it for the same price from John, I can save $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying it from John.
