"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, slightly above Bob's perceived value, to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and potentially encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going all the way to my minimum price ($120) yet, leaving room to potentially find a compromise."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'd like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I need to try and get closer to that.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  I've lowered my price, demonstrating a desire to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:** I remind Bob that $110 is still a good deal for him.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $105 is closer, it's still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $105. This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight fairness:** I emphasize that the price is fair for both of us, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
