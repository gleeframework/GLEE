{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $18,000. I believe it has great potential for you, but I'm also willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also emphasizing the potential value for Bob to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum value, I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I want to explore if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This still leaves room for me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $15000. I can do $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned about the risk of losing the deal altogether.  If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll have to consider selling to John."
