"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price considering its age and current market value."",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is substantially lower than Alice's initial offer. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning  ""age and current market value,"" you're subtly implying you've done some research and are not easily swayed by the initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves significant space to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both parties, but still well below your $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $5,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly, the offer is still above your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm still very interested, but $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** You are moving closer to Alice's price, signaling that you're willing to compromise. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** The $7,000 offer keeps you below your $8,000 maximum and leaves room for a final small concession if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""How about we meet in the middle,"" you imply that you're getting closer to a decision point â€“ either a deal is reached soon, or you might have to explore other options."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
