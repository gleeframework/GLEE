"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, considering your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
