"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $15,000 is above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get close to his maximum budget.  He's also stating his reasons for the lower price, hoping to make Alice more receptive to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, considering your interest in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $13,500, which is closer to Bob's budget but still slightly above his ideal price. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer to try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground, offering $13,000 which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  This shows he is willing to compromise and demonstrates a commitment to reaching a deal."
