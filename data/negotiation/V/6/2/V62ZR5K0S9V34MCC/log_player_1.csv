{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is still below my minimum value but above Bob's perceived value. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a deal closer to the middle ground. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore all options with Bob first. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I can adjust my strategy. If he counteroffers too low, I may need to be more assertive. If he's close to my price, I might be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000. This is my best offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is a solid backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a significant move towards Bob's price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** $950,000 is still closer to my desired value than Bob's offer. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's response:**  I will carefully analyze Bob's next move to determine if I should make further concessions or stick to my position.
* **John's offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950000, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price. Let's split the difference and meet at $900000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired value:**  $900,000 is significantly closer to my desired value of $1,200,000 than Bob's previous offer of $850,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, especially if Bob is unwilling to budge further. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could potentially get closer to $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or losing the deal altogether. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** While John's offer is higher, it comes with a guaranteed sale, whereas Bob still has the possibility of rejecting my counteroffer.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

The potential benefits of accepting Bob's offer outweigh the risks of further negotiation.  $900,000 is a reasonable price, and I believe it's the best outcome in this scenario."
