Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum ($1,200,000) increases the chances he'll accept.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The language is positive and emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, making it more appealing while still netting you a significant profit. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
