"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite low.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $145 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $75? That would be a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Let's try $130. It's my final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't go that high.  I can do $80, which is a good deal considering John is selling it for the same price.  Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,6,
