"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite low.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $145?"", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $145 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $75? That would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Let's try $130. It's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't go that high.  I can do $80, which is a good deal considering John is selling it for the same price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $80 and is unlikely to go higher. He's even trying to use John's offer as leverage, even though it's clear John's offer is better for you.  Cut your losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
