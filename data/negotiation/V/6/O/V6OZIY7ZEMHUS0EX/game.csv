"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,250 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
