"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
