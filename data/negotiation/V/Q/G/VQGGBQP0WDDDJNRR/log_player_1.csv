"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $1,200,000 is still far below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1800000 to $1600000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $1,400,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1550000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but no higher. Can you meet me at $1400000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to come close enough to my minimum price, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity to make a good profit."
