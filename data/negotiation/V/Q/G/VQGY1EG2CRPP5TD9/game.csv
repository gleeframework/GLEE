"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000. This reflects the maximum I can pay while still making this a worthwhile purchase for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,
