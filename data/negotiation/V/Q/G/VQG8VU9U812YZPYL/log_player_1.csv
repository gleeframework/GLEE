{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly less than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for potential compromise while ensuring a profit for me. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
