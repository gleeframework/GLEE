"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, her bluff is weak because she stands to lose money if she sells to the other buyer at $1,200,000.
* You have a better alternative with John, who will sell the product for $1,500,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with John's offer if necessary."
