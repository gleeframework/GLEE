Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting with a price that's not too high, I aim to keep Bob interested and allow for potential counteroffers. This strategy increases the chances of a successful negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price to match my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept his initial offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, but that's the lowest I can go.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aims to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints but also emphasizes the value of the product, making it clear that $90 is a fair price. 

By offering a compromise and continuing the negotiation, I aim to reach a mutually agreeable price that is closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still need to stay within my budget of $80. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I am willing to negotiate further but I will not accept his offer. I will counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $85 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference and settle on $90.  I'm confident you'll agree that this is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90:**  I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $90. It's a fair compromise considering the negotiation history.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's persistence while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of the $90 price. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually agreeable price without sacrificing my minimum acceptable price, while still demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
