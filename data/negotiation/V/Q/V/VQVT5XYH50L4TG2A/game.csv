"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider lowering the price to match my budget?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, but that's the lowest I can go.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I still need to stay within my budget of $80. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $85 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference and settle on $90.  I'm confident you'll agree that this is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
