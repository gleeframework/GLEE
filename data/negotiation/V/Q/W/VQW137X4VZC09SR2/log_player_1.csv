"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point, as it's  above my minimum price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $85 is too low for me at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $87. While I would have liked to get more, I'm happy to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
