"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a decent deal.
