# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. This saves you money compared to the other options."
