I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can still make a good profit even if I have to come down a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to sell it for that if there's a chance I can get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a good profit, but is significantly lower than my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will find this price more appealing and we can finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I'd rather sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than taking a further loss with Bob."
