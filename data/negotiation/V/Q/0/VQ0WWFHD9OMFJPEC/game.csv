"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. Given the value of the product and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is significant. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the true potential of this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
