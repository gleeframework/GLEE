Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If he rejects it, I can always lower the price, or I can sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a midpoint between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  It shows flexibility while still being above my minimum price."
