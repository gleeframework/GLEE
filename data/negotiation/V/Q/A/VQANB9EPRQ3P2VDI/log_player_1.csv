You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or losing the sale altogether."
