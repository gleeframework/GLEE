"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $825,000. This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
