Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12,750? I think we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate towards a middle ground. While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer of $12,750 is a safe bet. It provides a significant profit compared to John's offer.
