# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth to your business.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $1,050,000 and John offers the product for $1,000,000.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
