"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could be beneficial to my business, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Could we work with a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's benefits to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
