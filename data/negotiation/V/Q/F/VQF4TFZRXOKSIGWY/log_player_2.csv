"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal that I think you won't want to pass up! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can do $108, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within Bob's budget and only $8 more than Alice's value.  It's a good deal for both parties, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity to get the product at a decent price.  There's no guarantee that he'll get a better deal in future rounds, and John is still offering the product for $120."
