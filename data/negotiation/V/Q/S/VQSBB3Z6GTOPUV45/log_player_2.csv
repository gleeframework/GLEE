"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a lower counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value. This starts the negotiation process and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a price even lower by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying persistent, aiming for a price that's a fair middle ground between their last offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a good deal."
