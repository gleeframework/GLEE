"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it, and it's a significant saving for you as well. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a significant discount from the original price, I'm still not willing to part with the product for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's desired price point of $1,000,000. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate to try and secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the discount you're looking for. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant discount from her initial price of $1,200,000 and is close to Bob's desired price of $1,050,000.  At this point,  accepting the offer is the best course of action.  Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but it's risky given that Bob has limited rounds and could end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John if he doesn't close the deal with Alice."
