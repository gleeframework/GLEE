"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more enticing. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.

**Note:**  I'm starting with a bold offer knowing that Bob is likely to counter.  However, I'm prepared to potentially walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation, especially since I have multiple rounds to work with.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal, I want to explore the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest. While $900,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000? "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving my price down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  Even at $1,050,000, I'm still earning more than my minimum desired amount. 

**Strategy:** I'm trying to build momentum towards a deal by showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still too low to accept at this stage.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still secure a better price, especially since I have multiple rounds left.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a tempting option, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** This offer aligns with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I subtly remind Bob about the potential for me to sell to John.

**Strategy:**  I'm strategically using a combination of firmness and appeal to push for my minimum acceptable price. The limited rounds remaining and the possibility of selling to John are strong motivators for Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **Limited Upside:** While there's still potential to negotiate, the chance of getting a significantly better price from Bob is slim. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a safe and guaranteed outcome.

**Conclusion:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob outweighs the potential benefits of continued negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees a satisfactory profit and minimizes the risk of a failed deal."
