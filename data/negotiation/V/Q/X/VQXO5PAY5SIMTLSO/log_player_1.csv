Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, I believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Bob is moving closer to my price, but I'm still above my minimum.  I need to counter in a way that keeps him engaged but also shows I'm firm on value."

Bob is getting very close to my absolute minimum.  I need to hold firm for one more round and see if he's willing to budge.  If not, John might be my best option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've given this offer a lot of thought.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,375,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go and still feel good about the value we're both getting.

It's time to cut bait.  Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum, and I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risking further negotiation with Bob."
