"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference at $16,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $18,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
