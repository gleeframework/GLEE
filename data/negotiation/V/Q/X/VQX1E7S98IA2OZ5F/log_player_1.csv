"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even higher than our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" we provide a reason for the high initial price without revealing its true worth to us. 
* **Setting the Tone:** This first offer establishes us as confident in the product's value, potentially encouraging Bob to counter with a serious offer.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while remaining aware that we have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $1,500,000. We know John provides a guaranteed sale at that minimum. 

By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more. We'll use the next round to try and negotiate closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We lowered our price significantly from the initial offer but remain above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining our position. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high and then making a substantial decrease, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to our desired range.
* **Positive Language:** We continue to use positive language, highlighting the ""value"" of the product and our ""willingness to negotiate,"" fostering a collaborative atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product is overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000).  While we could push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Lower his offer:**  He might perceive our unwillingness to accept $1,600,000 as a sign that we're being unreasonable.
* **Walk away:**  There's always a chance Bob will end negotiations if he feels we're not meeting him close enough to his perceived value.

Accepting $1,600,000 secures a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and eliminates the risk of losing this deal entirely."
