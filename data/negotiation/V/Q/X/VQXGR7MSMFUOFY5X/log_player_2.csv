"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000, so it's a good deal. Accepting the offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
