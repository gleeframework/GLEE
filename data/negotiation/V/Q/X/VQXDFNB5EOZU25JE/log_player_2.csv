"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
