Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, considering I can sell to John for $800,000.  It's a win-win for both of us."
