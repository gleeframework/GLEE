"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a unique piece with a lot of value, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  It's a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
