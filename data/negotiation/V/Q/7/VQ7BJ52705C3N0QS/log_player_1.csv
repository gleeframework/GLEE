Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it would be a valuable addition to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, reflecting its potential value and my ability to purchase it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $800,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, reflecting the true value of this unique product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still beyond my price point. I'm confident that $950000 is a fair price for this product, reflecting its value and my ability to purchase it. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This price would be fair to both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is unfortunately still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to go as high as $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my ability to purchase it.  Let's reach a deal before we lose valuable time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, but with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't have the time to risk another counter-offer from Bob.  I'll take John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity."
