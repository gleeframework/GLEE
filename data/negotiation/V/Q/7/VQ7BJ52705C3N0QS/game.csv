"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, reflecting its potential value and my ability to purchase it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting the true value of this unique product. Let's meet in the middle!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still beyond my price point. I'm confident that $950000 is a fair price for this product, reflecting its value and my ability to purchase it. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000?  This price would be fair to both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is unfortunately still out of my budget.  I'm prepared to go as high as $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my ability to purchase it.  Let's reach a deal before we lose valuable time.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
