Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is offering more than my fallback option ($8,000). However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
