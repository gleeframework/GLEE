"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still allows you a profit, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping to get. Let's meet in the middle!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $7,000?  It's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,500.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's really the best I can do.  It's a great price for this product, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're happy with it.",7200.0,Bob,6,
