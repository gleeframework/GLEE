"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to give ourselves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it shows we're serious about a lower price point.
* **Polite and Respectful:** We maintain a friendly and professional tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Justification:**  We provide a brief reason for our counteroffer, referencing our budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still allows you a profit, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping to get. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down a bit, $8,500 is still higher than our fallback option of buying from John for $8,000.  We have room to negotiate further, and Alice seems willing to work towards a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $7,000?  It's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer to $7,000, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** By saying ""let's settle,"" we subtly imply we're eager to make a deal soon, which could encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,500.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our target price. Splitting the difference sounds good, but it's in our best interest to see if we can push a little further. We're still better off going with John if we can't get below $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's really the best I can do.  It's a great price for this product, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're happy with it."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Increment:** We're increasing our offer by a smaller amount ($200) this time, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're stating our position clearly (""best I can do"") while remaining appreciative of Alice's efforts. 
* **Urgency and Incentive:**  We're emphasizing our readiness to close the deal *today* if she accepts, which might encourage her to take the offer."
