"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm proposing $1200000 as a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your potential for success. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I still think $800000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
