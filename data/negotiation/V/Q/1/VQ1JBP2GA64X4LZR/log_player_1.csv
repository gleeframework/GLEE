Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $120 is far too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $145.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle?

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been stubborn and is unwilling to budge on his price. I've already offered him a fair deal, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John.  He's a reliable buyer and willing to pay my minimum."
