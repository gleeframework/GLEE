{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $65 was a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below where I want to be. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $80?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
