"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

We start with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's bottom line and leave room for negotiation.  We don't want to go too low and offend her, but this offer sets a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down a bit, calling it her ""final offer"" so early is likely a tactic. We're still significantly below our alternative option with John, so we'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000 even?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

We'll come up significantly this round, meeting exactly at Alice's perceived value. This shows we're serious about the purchase but also unwilling to overpay.  It's a strong offer and puts the ball firmly in Alice's court."
