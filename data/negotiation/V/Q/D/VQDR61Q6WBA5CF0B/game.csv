"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. It's a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a great price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500. How about we try $12750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13200? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make sure to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $13200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13200. How about we try $12600?",12600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12600 is getting close to my minimum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13000? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
