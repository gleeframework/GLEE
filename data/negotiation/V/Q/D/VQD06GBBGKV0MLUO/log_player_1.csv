Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""deal"" and the product's value, to encourage Bob's interest.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You earn a profit of $4,000 more than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have the flexibility to lower the price, potentially still selling above $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
