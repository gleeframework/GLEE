"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  I'm confident we can close this deal.",9875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go much lower than $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
