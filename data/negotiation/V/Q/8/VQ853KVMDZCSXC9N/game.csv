"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $875,000.  It's a strong offer for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
