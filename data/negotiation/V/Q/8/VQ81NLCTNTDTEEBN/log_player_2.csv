"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. You want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105 to make this deal work.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You can potentially get a better deal from Alice or even consider buying from John if you don't see a good opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $95 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
