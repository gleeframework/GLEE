"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this product at a discounted price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
