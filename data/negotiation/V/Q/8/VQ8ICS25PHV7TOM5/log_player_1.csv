Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $95 might be a tad high, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $85. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly anchored around the $85-90 range. Accepting his offer of $87.50 ensures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
