"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $100 as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I want to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also being realistic. I've lowered my price from $110 to $95, showing flexibility.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds, $85 is below my minimum acceptable price. I still have some room to negotiate and I'm hoping to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a lower price, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $90, which is still a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping to finalize the deal before running out of rounds and having to settle for John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're at round 6, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer."
