"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to maneuver before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. This establishes a clear boundary and signals my serious interest in buying the product. While Alice might not accept it immediately, it sets the stage for a focused negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to come down further. I want to see if she's willing to compromise more before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but still want a price that's fair for both of us. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and her latest offer.  We're getting closer, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is positive. However, $1,400,000 is still higher than my target price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push her down closer to my desired $1,250,000 or even lower. I believe there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.  It's a compromise that could be appealing to Alice, as she's been consistently lowering her price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement before the rounds run out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is close enough to my target price that it's worth accepting.  We're running out of rounds, and there's a risk of either Alice rejecting my next counteroffer or me having to buy from John at a higher price.  While I would prefer to pay even less, this offer represents a good deal, and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better price."
