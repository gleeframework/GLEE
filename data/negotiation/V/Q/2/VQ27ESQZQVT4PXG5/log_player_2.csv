"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than John's price, you can likely get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $120.  A counteroffer of $95 is a significant discount, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for your counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, you can still do better.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to counter and potentially close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're at your maximum price point with John's offer. This counteroffer is a final attempt to get Alice to meet your price.  If she rejects it, you can move on to John and secure the product at your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is only slightly better than John's offer of $100.  Since you have limited rounds, and this deal is unlikely to get any better, it's best to accept the guaranteed lower price from John.  You've already negotiated as much as you can with Alice and risk running out of rounds if you continue."
