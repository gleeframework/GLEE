{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) and leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay more, especially since he expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a good profit and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we try $1,320,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer.  It's close enough to my desired price and I'm confident this deal will go through.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to sell the product to Bob at this price."
