"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a good profit and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we try $1,320,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
