"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. $7500 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $8500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
