"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential for growth, and I think you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about $700,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $700,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
