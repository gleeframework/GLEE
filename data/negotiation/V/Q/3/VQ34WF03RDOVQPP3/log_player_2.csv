Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential for growth, and I think you'll see the value in it. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000 at this point, and you have a guaranteed offer from John.  There's no point in risking those savings for a minimal potential gain."
