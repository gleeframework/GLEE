"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product for $950000.  This is a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you, given its potential value of $1000000.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000.  Alice is offering the product for $950,000.  While this is a good deal, it's still above your desired price point. Rejecting her offer means you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your limit."
