Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Direct approach:** The message is clear and concise, indicating you're firm on the price. 
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it""**: This phrasing emphasizes that you're not necessarily open to haggling, putting the decision pressure on Bob.

**Outcome Considerations:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $18,000, netting you a $6,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer. You still sell to John for $12,000, meeting your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while minimizing risk."
