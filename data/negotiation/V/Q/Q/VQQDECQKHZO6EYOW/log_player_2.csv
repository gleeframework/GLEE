"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even cheaper. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.
* **Realistic expectation:** $90 is still a decent profit for Alice (given her value is $80), making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates Bob's willingness to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer."
