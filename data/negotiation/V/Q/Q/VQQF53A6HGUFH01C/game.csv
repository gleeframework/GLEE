"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $15000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $12500 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference one last time - how about $13750?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,5,
