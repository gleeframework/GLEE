"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for it, which still represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
