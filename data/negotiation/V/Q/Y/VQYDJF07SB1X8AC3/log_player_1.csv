"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still leaving a good profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value, and I have room to negotiate upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer, but still leaving a comfortable profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, especially with limited rounds remaining."
