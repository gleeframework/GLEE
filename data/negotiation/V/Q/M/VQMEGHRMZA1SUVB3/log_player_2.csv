"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it's priced fairly. If you're interested, let me know, and we can proceed. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is also willing to pay the full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since Alice is offering the product at her minimum price, there's no room for negotiation, and you can get the product from John at the same price."
