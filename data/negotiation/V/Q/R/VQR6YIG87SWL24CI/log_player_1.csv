"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering. While $850,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This offer reflects my maximum value for it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $900,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
