"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer if you're not willing to accept it.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $140. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
