"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10800, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making one last concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10800 and $11200, which would be $10000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $10000. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised by your sudden willingness to meet me at $10000, Bob. However, I've already considered selling the product to John at this price, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11500. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you at $10800, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $10000. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're going around in circles, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm still not getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11200, and this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",11200.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me at your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to go above $10800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $10000.
