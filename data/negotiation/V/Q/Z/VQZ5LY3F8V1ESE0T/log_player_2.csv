"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, but you want to save as much as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $110 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an offer of $107. This allows some room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $107 is within your acceptable range of $120 and is a significant improvement from her initial offer. 
* It's getting close to your target price of $105, and continuing to negotiate might risk her rejecting your counteroffer or having to pay the full $120 to John. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and saves you time and effort compared to further negotiations."
