"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  If you're serious about making this deal, I think this is a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11250.0,Alice,5,
