Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his desired price. He can try to negotiate further to bring the price down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $11,250 is still more than his ideal price, it's closer to his desired range and lower than what John is selling it for. It's a good compromise and likely the best deal he'll get."
