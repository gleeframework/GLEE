"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its true value is closer to $15,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
