Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while still giving Bob some room to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and selling to John only nets me $1,500,000. It's more profitable to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
