"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your perspective and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go. To be honest, my absolute maximum budget for this is $800,000. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
