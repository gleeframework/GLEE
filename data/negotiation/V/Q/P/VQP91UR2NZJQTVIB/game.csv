"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1550000? I'm open to negotiations, but I need to stay above $1475000 to make it worth my while.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1525000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and move us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1525000 is a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we discuss a price of $1537500? This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",1537500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $1530000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1500000. How about we discuss a price of $1520000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping it will be acceptable to you.",1520000.0,Alice,7,
