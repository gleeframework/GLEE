"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $170 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $120. 
* **Counteroffers are possible:** You have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting her initial offer makes sense.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed way to get the product within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. If you're interested in selling it at that price, let me know. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

* **Still above your budget:** $145 is still more than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Negotiation continues:** You're still willing to negotiate with Alice and have several rounds remaining.
* **John's offer is still a backup:**  You can always buy from John if this negotiation fails."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $132.50. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $132.50. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $140. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above budget:**  $140 is still more than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** Alice is showing a willingness to come down in price, and you have more rounds to try and get a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you $138. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to budget, but not there:** $138 is still outside your budget of $120, even though Alice is coming down in price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You have only 3 rounds left, and you may not be able to get a better price within that timeframe. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Since John is selling the product for $120, you are guaranteed to get the product within your budget by buying from him.

**It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now rather than risk running out of time and potentially ending up paying more.**"
