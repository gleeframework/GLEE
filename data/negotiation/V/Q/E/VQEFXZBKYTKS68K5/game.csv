"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly under its true value.  I could consider a price closer to $1,800,000.  This is a more realistic reflection of what it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,300,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $1,300,000 is a little too low for me to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,450,000. That's my final offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
