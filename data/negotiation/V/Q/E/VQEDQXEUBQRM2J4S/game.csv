,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $550,000 is far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value this product holds for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's try $850,000. That's a fair price considering the value this product offers. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could do $700,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within a reasonable budget.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the lowest I can go. This price reflects the product's true value and the potential benefits it offers. It's a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,7,
