Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $100 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $80. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:** $110 still provides me with a profit above my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $105 is very close to my initial target of $110.
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation might take more time, potentially jeopardizing the deal with Bob. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
