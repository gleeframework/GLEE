{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's $10,000 valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $12,000 is lower than your minimum of $15,000, so you're open to negotiating further.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It signals that you're serious about selling, but you're also not giving away the product for a low price. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while maintaining your negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in my best interest to sell the product for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below the $15,000 I can get from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
