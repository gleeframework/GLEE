"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you.  I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a discounted price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price. She knows the product is worth $12,000 to her, so there's a chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to that amount. 

You always have the safety net of buying from John at $15,000, so there's little risk in seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice."
