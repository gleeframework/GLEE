``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $100. You can save money by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.5

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $100.  While it's closer than her initial offer, I can still try to negotiate lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $94.50

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $94.50 is still above my target price of $100.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's getting close to the point where it might be more time-consuming and frustrating than just buying from John for $100.  I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price for the sake of convenience."
