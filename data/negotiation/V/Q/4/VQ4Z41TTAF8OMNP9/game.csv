,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $109? This way, we both get a good deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
