Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for the value of this product.

You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go down to $90. It's a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $90.  While she might come down slightly in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and forcing you to either overpay or restart with John. You can buy the product for your target price right now from John."
