"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $120. It's a great deal for a fantastic product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I've lowered the offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still well below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. Hopefully, this compromise will be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $100 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $80.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum, I want to try to push for a higher price. I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired value in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $90. It's a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm making a slight concession by lowering my offer to $90, but I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum. I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
