"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, I start significantly higher to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer allows me to gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds, making concessions while gauging Bob's reactions and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, I know I have more negotiating room. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle between his offer and my initial price.  I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000, especially since I have the backup option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  I start by recognizing Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm engaging in the negotiation process. 
* **Holding Firm:** I reiterate that his price is too low but use softer language (""significantly below"") to avoid sounding dismissive.
* **Compromise:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm splitting the difference between his offer and my previous price. This signals a willingness to be flexible while still aiming high. 
* **Clear Target:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and provides Bob with a clear target that's more realistic than my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating he's interested. However, we're still below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is an option, securing a deal slightly above that guarantees a profit. I'll use the remaining rounds to nudge Bob closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,050,000? This recognizes the true value of what's being offered while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I start by complimenting Bob's commitment to the negotiation, fostering goodwill.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I reiterate the need for a mutually beneficial solution, emphasizing collaboration.
* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing the price to $1,050,000, I'm showing flexibility while still staying above John's offer. 
* **Finality:**  The tone of this message suggests a sense of urgency and a desire to close the deal soon. This encourages Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently sticking to smaller increments and is unlikely to reach my desired price point within the remaining rounds.  While $975,000 is a good offer, John's guaranteed $1,000,000 eliminates risk and potential further haggling. It's time to secure the profit and move forward."
