Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $950000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $1050000 as a reasonable price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,050,000 is a good deal considering the time constraint and the risk of losing the sale altogether. It's also a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer."
