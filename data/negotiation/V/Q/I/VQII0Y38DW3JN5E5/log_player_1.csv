Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm aiming for the highest possible profit while still maintaining the possibility of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us and might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to take the risk of further negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
