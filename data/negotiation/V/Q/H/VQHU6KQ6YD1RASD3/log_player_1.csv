Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale. I think it's really valuable, so I'm starting the price at $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and might result in a better outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $150, Alice signals that she's willing to negotiate.  
* **Justification:** The phrase ""I think it's really valuable"" is a soft justification for the high starting price without revealing the minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still being realistic about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. This suggests he has room to negotiate upwards. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a fairer price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price of $120, Alice shows a willingness to compromise but still maintains a significant margin above her minimum price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties and encourage agreement. 
* **No Justification:** At this stage, providing additional justification for the price might not be necessary and could weaken Alice's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could do $85, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still significantly below your $100 minimum and his perceived value.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a better result. You are close enough to your minimum and John's offer that it's worth pushing Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to John's Offer:** By proposing $100, Alice subtly brings Bob's attention to the fact that she has another buyer at that price. This creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to counter with much lower offers.
* **Firm but Fair:** This offer shows Alice is willing to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary. It's unlikely Bob will find a better deal elsewhere, knowing Alice has a guaranteed buyer.
* **Simplified Decision:** Offering a clean $100 makes it an easy decision for Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance."
