"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about $1,100,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, but I still think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
