"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $200 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $155?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $165? It's still a good deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
