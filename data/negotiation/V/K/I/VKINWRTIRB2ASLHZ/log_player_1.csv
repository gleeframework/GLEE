Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate if he wants to. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** The message indicates openness to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to engage.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is both profitable for you and attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer of $110 is still above your minimum of $80, and it's closer to your initial offer of $120.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit for you."
