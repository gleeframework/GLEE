"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high initially to give ourselves room to negotiate downwards. This starting point is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000).
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting price"" implies we're open to discussion and potential adjustments. 

We want to secure a price as close to Bob's perceived value as possible, while always keeping in mind our guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, we're still in early rounds.  Rejecting now allows us to:

* **Gauge his flexibility:** We need to see how much he's willing to move. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** Accepting too early might signal we're willing to go much lower.

We'll counter with a price closer to his, but still above our minimum, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?  I believe that's a competitive offer that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We're acknowledging his offer and aiming for a collaborative feel.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Our drop from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000 is significant, showing we're willing to negotiate but not drastically.
* **Reinforcing Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's worth, subtly anchoring the price at a higher point.

We're aiming for a price that's beneficial for both of us, but we won't hesitate to walk away if it goes below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we try $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our range, but we're not there yet.  We need to:

* **Hold Firm:** Accepting $1,050,000 leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Test His Resolve:**  By rejecting, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and see if he's willing to budge further.

We'll offer a smaller concession this round to maintain upward pressure on the price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,125,000?  That's me coming down significantly to meet you halfway."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding and Compromise:** We're acknowledging his desire for a fair price and positioning this as a win-win.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic can feel like a natural compromise, even though it's still above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Our Concession:**  By emphasizing our significant drop, we're putting subtle pressure on him to reciprocate. 

We're now getting closer to a critical point in the negotiation. We'll need to decide soon how much lower we're willing to go and potentially consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we try $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a significant profit margin above our $800,000 minimum and a good deal overall.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might lead to a stalemate or an unfavorable compromise. It's better to secure a good deal now.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further rounds take time. Accepting now allows us to potentially pursue other business opportunities. 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's $800,000 offer is too great at this point."
