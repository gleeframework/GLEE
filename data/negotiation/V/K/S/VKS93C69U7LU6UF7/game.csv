"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it quite valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is unfortunately not enough. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll agree. ",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10000 is a lot closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a little more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite comfortable with $10500. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,8,
