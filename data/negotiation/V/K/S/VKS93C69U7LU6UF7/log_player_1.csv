"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is way too low. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is unfortunately not enough. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$9,500 is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll agree. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still a bit lower than what I want. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $10,000 is a lot closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a little more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite comfortable with $10500. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close, and with only two rounds left, the risk of losing out to John is starting to feel real.  It's better to get $10,250 than to risk getting only $12,000."
