"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable offer. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you more leverage.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Reason to buy:**  Even though Bob knows the product's value, reminding him of its value can help him feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first round. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* I'll be mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is a good price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable offer of $100. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price, which strengthens my negotiating position.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to $100, but still potentially lower than my initial offer of $110.  I'll analyze how strongly Bob wants the product and try to strike a deal that benefits both of us. 
* I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $105. I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** I'm starting to bridge the gap between my initial price and Bob's offer.  Offering $105 shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Fair deal for both:** I frame the offer as a win-win situation, which can make Bob more receptive.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I haven't completely given in to Bob's offer yet, showing that I still have some room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully consider Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer again, I might need to lower my price further or consider selling to John.
* I'll continue to assess Bob's interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $97.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable offer of $100, it's still not enough.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me another chance to try and secure a better price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, perhaps $102.50, to show a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he continues to reject offers, I'll need to weigh the risks and rewards of selling to John versus continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $102.50.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap further:**  I'm continuing to close the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. Offering $102.50 shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the price in relation to the product's value.
* **Keeping negotiations open:** By making a counteroffer, I'm indicating my desire to reach an agreement with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate the situation.  If he's close to my minimum, I might continue to negotiate.  However, if his counteroffers are consistently too low, I may consider selling to John to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $95 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable offer of $100. 
* **Limited rounds:**  We've already gone through 6 rounds, and I'm not confident that Bob will come closer to my price in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, which is more important than trying to squeeze a few extra dollars out of Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm choosing to maximize my profits by selling to John. This decision is based on the time limit, the risk of Bob not raising his offer, and the guaranteed profit with John."
