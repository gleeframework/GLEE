Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $150 offer represents a 50% markup, which isn't unreasonably high and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate his perceived value of the product. If he rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have a safety net with John."
