Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're very close, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount for this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $1,200,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at that price.

It's clear Alice won't budge below $1,200,000.  While John's price is higher, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice, who might not budge at all.  Buying from John guarantees the product at a price within my budget."
