"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,625? I think that's a fair compromise, and it's a good price for a product of this quality.",7625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that. I'd be willing to do $7,400.  That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",7400.0,Bob,6,
