"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product goes beyond that.  Would you consider $1,700,000?  This price reflects the inherent worth and potential I see in its application for your specific needs.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is justified. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
