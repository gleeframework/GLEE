Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial offer and $5 more than my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather not risk losing a sale and getting only $120 from John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
