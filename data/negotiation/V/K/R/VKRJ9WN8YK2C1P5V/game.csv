"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $180 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is cutting a bit too close to my bottom line. I could do $130, and that's my final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still slightly out of my budget. How about we settle on $125? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can close the deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
