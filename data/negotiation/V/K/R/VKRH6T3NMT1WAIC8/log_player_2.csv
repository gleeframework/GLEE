"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $7000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice's offer is lower.  There's potential to get an even better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm ready to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6800 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice's offer of $6,800 is better than what Bob could get from John ($8,000) and is a good compromise. While Bob could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice would accept and he could risk ending up paying more from John."
