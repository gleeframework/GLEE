"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $7000 for the product.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm ready to pay $6500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6800 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",6800.0,Alice,3,
