Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it at $14,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a price he's even more comfortable with, getting you closer to $15,000.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
