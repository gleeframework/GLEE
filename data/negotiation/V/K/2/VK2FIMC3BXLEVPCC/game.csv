"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
