Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have John as a backup who will buy the product for $80, ensuring I don't lose money. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, I increase the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit."
