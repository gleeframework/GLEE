"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,250,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my ability to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While John's offer is becoming more tempting, there's room for Bob to increase his offer substantially. We will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to our agreement.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments now. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly exceeds John's offer within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures we receive our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
