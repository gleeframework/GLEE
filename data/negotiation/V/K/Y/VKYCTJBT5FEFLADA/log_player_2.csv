"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay. Since I have 10 rounds and the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a price that is likely attractive to Alice, given her $800,000 valuation, and it gives me a substantial savings compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is actually higher than her initial offer, indicating that she is trying to push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  I believe this price is appealing to Alice as it's closer to her valuation, while still offering me a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting increasingly unreasonable. She's pushing for a price that's getting closer to what I'd pay from John.  However, I still have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can bring her down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant increase, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit, while still representing a significant savings for me compared to buying from John.  I believe this offer is fair and reasonable, and I'm hopeful that Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, with her latest offer at $1,050,000.  This is a significant increase from her previous offers and is approaching what I would pay to John.  With only 3 rounds remaining, there is a high probability that Alice will continue to raise her prices. 

It's better to cut my losses and buy from John at $1,200,000 to avoid risking further price increases from Alice in the remaining rounds. While I'm not getting the best deal, at least I'm guaranteed to acquire the product within my budget."
