"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is more than Alice values the product for, it's significantly less than your maximum price of $15,000 and the guaranteed $15,000 you'd spend buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
