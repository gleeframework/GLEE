Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. It also allows for me to potentially increase the price if he accepts my offer.
* **Attractive Offer:** A $130 price is still a decent deal for Bob, considering his estimated value. It's worth considering if he can afford it.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message is open to counteroffers, allowing for further negotiation if needed.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I still have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I'm not taking an unreasonable risk by offering a lower price to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate, $110 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob, as his counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial estimate.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which provides me with a safety net and allows me to hold out for a better deal with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, giving me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $120?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm using my counteroffer to bridge the gap between Bob's offer ($110) and my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Fair Compromise:** $120 represents a compromise, offering a significant discount from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Positive Messaging:** My message is positive and collaborative, emphasizing the mutual benefit of a deal at this price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed, acknowledging that Bob might still have reservations. 

This strategy aims to find a mutually acceptable price while keeping in mind the potential sale to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It's likely that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a price that's still lower than my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer of $150 provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

Given these factors, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John, ensuring a higher profit and minimizing the risk of a lower price."
