{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to decide promptly."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you need to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while ensuring you stay above your minimum.

The offer of $925,000 creates a potential profit of $125,000 for you. This price leaves Bob with a potential gain (consumer surplus) of $75,000, making it a favorable deal for him compared to not getting the product at all."
