"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we discuss the possibility of meeting at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and propose a price of $1050000. This reflects the product's true value and still provides you with a significant opportunity.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
