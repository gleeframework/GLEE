"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the [product name], but I'd only be able to pay $150 for it right now. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Would you be willing to meet me at $175? That's still a good deal, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $160, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",160.0,Bob,4,
