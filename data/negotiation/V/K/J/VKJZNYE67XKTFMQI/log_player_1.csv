{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Start high:**  $950,000 is significantly closer to Bob's perceived value than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately making me seem unreasonable.
* **Be positive and inviting:** A friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  Emphasizing that the deal is good for both of us can be persuasive. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $800,000, my minimum acceptable price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By offering a price higher than Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on a middle ground:**  The $800,000 price is exactly halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Be firm:**  Stating that $800,000 is my minimum emphasizes that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm remaining friendly while being clear about my expectations.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be forced to accept John's offer of $800,000. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and accepts my offer."
