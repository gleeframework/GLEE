"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is starting high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to move on price. We're aiming for a price closer to her value ($800,000) while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $800,000, my minimum acceptable price.  Let's make this deal happen.

Alice has countered with her own value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well below John's offer.  Accepting is the best decision here."
