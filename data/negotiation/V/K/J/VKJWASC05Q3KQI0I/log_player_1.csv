Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a high starting point, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or go with John's offer for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, $1,700,000 is still above my minimum price and significantly better than selling to John for $1,500,000.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but at this point, I think it's time to close the deal."
