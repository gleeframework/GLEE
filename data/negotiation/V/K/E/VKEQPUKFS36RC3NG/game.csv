"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $900,000? That's a significant price for me, and it gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
