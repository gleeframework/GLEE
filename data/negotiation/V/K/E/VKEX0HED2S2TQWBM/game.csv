"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This still provides you with a substantial saving compared to your initial assessment and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further than that. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
