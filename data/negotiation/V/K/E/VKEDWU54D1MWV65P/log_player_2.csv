"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice presents the $15,000 as a ""special price,"" it's the maximum you're willing to pay and the same price John offers. There's no benefit to accepting immediately. By rejecting the offer, you give Alice a chance to potentially lower the price to entice you.  If she doesn't, you can still buy from John at the same price."
