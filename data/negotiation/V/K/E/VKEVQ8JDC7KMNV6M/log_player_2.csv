{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $6,000 is a great price, but it's always worth seeing if you can do even better.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test the waters and see how flexible Alice is willing to be."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down slightly, but $5,500 is still too high.  I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am still looking for a better deal. It's a compromise, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my target while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $5,200 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit lower, but if Alice doesn't budge, I might consider buying from John.  I've only used 5 rounds, so I still have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $4,800.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to move but still trying to get a good deal. We're getting closer, and with only 4 rounds left, I want to see if Alice will meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly to $5,000, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's only $200 more than my last counteroffer.  It's a good deal overall."
