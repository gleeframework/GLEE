"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering the value it holds for me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product to you for $950000.  This price reflects the significant value you've acknowledged it has, while also being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850000, which reflects the value I place on the product and is closer to what I can afford.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value you've acknowledged the product holds for your business, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $900000. This price reflects a significant discount from my original offer and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll seriously consider it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This reflects the value I see in your product and is the most I can reasonably offer. I sincerely hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To be completely transparent, I'm willing to accept $890000 for the product. This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it holds for both of us. If we don't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",890000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my target, I still need to stay within my budget. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $850000. This is the absolute most I can offer at this time.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,
