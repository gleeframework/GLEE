**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting it for less than your maximum budget."
