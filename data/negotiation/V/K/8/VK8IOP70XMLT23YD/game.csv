"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? It's a fair offer considering it's more than a third off your initial asking price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I think it's a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $7,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
