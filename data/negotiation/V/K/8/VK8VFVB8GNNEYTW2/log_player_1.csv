Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $9,000 I feel is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob. I'll make one last counteroffer in the next round before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet at $8,900.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get as close as possible to my target price. How about we meet at $8,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's unlikely he'll budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
