Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** $100 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows you some flexibility in case Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $100 price feels like a fair starting point for a negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above Bob's valuation, it's below my minimum and significantly lower than what I could get from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to be closer to $95 to make this work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not desperate to sell it for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle at $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my minimum price, $90 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow me to close the deal with Bob.  It's still higher than what Bob was initially willing to pay, and it's more than I would get if I sold to John."
