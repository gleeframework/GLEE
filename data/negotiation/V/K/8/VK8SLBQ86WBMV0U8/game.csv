"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $22,000 represents a significant discount from the true value this product offers. To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",20000.0,Alice,3,
