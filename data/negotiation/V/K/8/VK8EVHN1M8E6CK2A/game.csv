"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $650,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $675,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",675000.0,Alice,3,
