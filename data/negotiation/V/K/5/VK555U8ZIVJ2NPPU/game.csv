"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product.  However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This price is a good compromise and reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
