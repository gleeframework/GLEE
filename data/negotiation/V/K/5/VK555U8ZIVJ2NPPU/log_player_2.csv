"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  You have a lot of room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice is happy to sell for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a counteroffer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your target price. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get it closer to your desired price of $750,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try again to bring the price down."
