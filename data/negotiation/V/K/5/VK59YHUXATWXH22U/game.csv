I would like to make a counterproposal to accommodate your offer while still ensuring fair compensation for our product. In light of your willingness to pay up to $150, I am proposing a final price of $165 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on the item while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you find this offer acceptable.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit higher than my limit. As I mentioned before, I'm comfortable paying up to $150.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
