"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? That's the highest I can go, but I really want to make a deal with you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
