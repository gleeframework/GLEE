{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    *  It's a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
    * It allows Bob to gain a potential profit of $150,000 ($950,000 - $800,000). 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
