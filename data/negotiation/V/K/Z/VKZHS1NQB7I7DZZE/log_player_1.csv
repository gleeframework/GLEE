Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  By highlighting the product's value, you might influence Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $20,000 offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while staying well above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your $15,000 minimum and your initial offer of $20,000. Accepting now would be leaving a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still space to negotiate between his offer and your minimum.  
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer, so you can be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position above your minimum price. It aims for a compromise closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** By re-emphasizing the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob why a higher price is justified. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer keeps the negotiation active and gives you room to potentially go lower if needed, while still staying above your safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $17,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we settle around $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** While Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to your $15,000 minimum, it's still a significant difference.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** By rejecting this offer, you can gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. He might be holding back some of his budget.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have John's offer as a fallback. This gives you the power to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. Let's make this happen – I can go down to $14,500. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 14500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer shows you're willing to compromise but sets a clear boundary. By stating it's your final offer, you add weight to the negotiation. 
* **Introducing Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (even if it's just implied) creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $14,500 price is a strong position – a good profit above your minimum while still potentially appealing to Bob if he's genuinely interested."
