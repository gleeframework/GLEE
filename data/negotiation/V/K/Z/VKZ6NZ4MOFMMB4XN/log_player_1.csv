"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  $50 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150,  I am still hoping for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $160.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
