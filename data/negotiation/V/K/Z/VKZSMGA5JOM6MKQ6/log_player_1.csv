Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $80, offering it slightly above that might not work. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John at $120, so there's room to negotiate with Bob.

By starting at $110, Alice leaves room for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value."
