"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you today.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something we can work with?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000. Is that something we can work with?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that the product will be worth it for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. Is that something we can work with?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1030000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concessions, but $1030000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $990000 for the product. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $990000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",1020000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go above $990000. I'm making a final counteroffer of $990000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to buy from another seller.",990000.0,Bob,10,
