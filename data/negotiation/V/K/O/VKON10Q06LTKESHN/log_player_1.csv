Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a good starting point:** It's a reasonable price that leaves room for negotiation without being too aggressive. 
* **The message is friendly and informative:** It highlights the value to Bob and emphasizes the willingness to negotiate.
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * Get the ball rolling with a fair offer.
    * Assess Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
    *  Maintain the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:**  $90 is only $10 below your desired price and still a good profit.
* **There's a risk in rejecting:** If you reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving you with only John's $80 offer.
* **Accepting secures a decent profit:** By accepting, you guarantee a sale and a profit of $10 over your minimum."
