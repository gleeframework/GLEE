Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** I'm aiming for more than $10,000, my minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for potential counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually beneficial price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my target of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  $13,000 is a good compromise that hopefully will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still a good deal. It's significantly more than what John would pay and closer to my desired outcome than my previous counteroffer.  It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
