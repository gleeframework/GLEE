Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Listen to his perspective and be willing to adjust your price slightly if it makes sense. However, don't go below your $8,000 minimum."
