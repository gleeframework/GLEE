"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You still get a good deal:**  Even at $900,000, you are getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000."
