"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is below the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you working with me, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price. He'll counteroffer and aim to get closer to his target price of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit.  $9,250 is still above his budget, and he's already gone back and forth several times with Alice.  It's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower, so Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000.  While he doesn't get the absolute best price, he avoids further negotiation and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
