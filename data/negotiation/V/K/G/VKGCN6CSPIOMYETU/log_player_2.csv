Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $900000. This allows for a good profit for both of us and allows me to stay closer to my initial value.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
