"Alice, your offer is tempting but a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $900000. This allows for a good profit for both of us and allows me to stay closer to my initial value.  Let's try to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This price is fair considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,
