{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $8,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still a reasonable amount for me to pay, given my maximum budget of $10,000.  This allows for room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Alice. I might be able to get a better deal if I keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500.  This is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice before I have to go with John's offer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still too high.  While I could continue to counter offer, I'm not sure I can get her down to my desired price.  It's better to go with John's offer and save money.  I can always look for other options in the future if I need a similar product."
