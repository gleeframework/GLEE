Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer aims for a significant profit while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Starting High:** By setting the price at $1,500,000, you create a strong initial point for negotiation. 
* **Profit Margin:**  This price would provide you with a 50% profit over John's offer, which is a very desirable outcome.
* **Testing the Market:**  Bob's response will reveal his perceived value of the product. If he rejects, you can still comfortably fall back on John's offer."
