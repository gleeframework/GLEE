"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it would be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to maximize my potential earnings. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for negotiation by asking Bob to let me know what he thinks. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll assess Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer to determine his perceived value and adjust my strategy accordingly.
*  I'll keep the option of selling to John for $10,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a better deal. I am willing to pay $14000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:**  $14,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $10,000, but I still have room to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance I can get closer to my initial asking price ($15,000) by counter-offering. 
* **Rounds remaining:** I have 9 rounds left, giving me time to explore further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $14,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value it offers. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a better price.
* **Positive framing:**  Again, I'm using positive language and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's make this happen!"" subtly creates a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer, as it's a fair compromise.
* If he rejects it, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and continue to adjust my offers based on his perceived value of the product.
* I'll still keep the option of selling to John as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
