"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $7800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $6200. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price.
