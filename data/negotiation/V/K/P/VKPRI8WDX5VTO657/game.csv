"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?  I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being closer to your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. To be completely transparent, I can secure the product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible.  Would you consider $925,000?  That's my best offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,

I'll meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
