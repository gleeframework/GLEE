Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, hoping to get a good deal.  I believe this price is still fair to Bob considering the value he places on the product. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm lowering my price by $100,000 from my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation and risking losing him as a buyer.  It's time to close the deal and secure the $1,500,000."
