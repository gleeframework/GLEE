I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also shows that I value the product.  I'm confident that Bob will either accept, counteroffer, or I can walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is sticking to his $12,000 offer. While I'd prefer more, it's still a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
