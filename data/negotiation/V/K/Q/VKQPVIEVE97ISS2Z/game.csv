"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a fair deal for both of us, as you'll still be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12750.0,Bob,4,
