Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 walk-away point.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed sale rather than risk Bob not meeting your expectations in the remaining rounds."
