Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually reduce the price, aiming to secure the highest possible amount above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have any insight into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your initial offer accordingly.
* **Market Information:** If possible, research if similar products have sold for more than $800,000 to strengthen your position.

**Remember:**  The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for Bob to accept."
