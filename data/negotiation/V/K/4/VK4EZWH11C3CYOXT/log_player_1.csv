"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value for the product ($10,000). I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to risk it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $10500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9800. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm worried that further negotiation will just lead to more concessions from my side.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him by continuing with Bob."
