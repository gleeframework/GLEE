"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $120, but still above her minimum value of $80. This leaves room for further negotiation while still demonstrating your serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $150. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up paying more for the product from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a fair price."
