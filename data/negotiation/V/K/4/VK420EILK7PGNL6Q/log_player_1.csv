Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John right now, and it allows me to avoid further negotiation rounds."
