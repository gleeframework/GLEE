"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that's a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
