Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $15000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $16500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $17500 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $16500. This is my absolute final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",16500.0,Bob,6,
