"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the product's value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John now would mean leaving money on the table if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show I'm open to negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefit of the product and the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $15000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable value.
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up with a lower price or have to sell to John.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the deal."
