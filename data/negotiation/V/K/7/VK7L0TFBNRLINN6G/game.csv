"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8800. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000.
