It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, you have room to bargain with Alice."

You can still get a better deal. You are willing to pay $700,000, and you know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. Keep negotiating!"

I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you a deal for $787,500.

Alice has come down to $787,500, which is only a bit above your last offer.  You can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so accepting this offer is the best option. It saves you money compared to buying from John, and you're only a bit above your last counteroffer."
