Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or walk away to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,500 is still too low for me. I'd rather counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
