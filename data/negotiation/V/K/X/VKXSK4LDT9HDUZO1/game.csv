"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $9,000 as a more reasonable price. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500.  This product offers significant value, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's the most I can afford. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
