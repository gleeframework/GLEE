Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $14,500 is still a bit steep for my budget. I could do $13,500, and I think that's a very fair offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise to close this deal.  Let's make it $14,000 even, and we can both walk away happy. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $14,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the $6,000."
