"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above the product's value to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, even though he knows the true value. 

This strategy allows me to explore if Bob is willing to pay more than the product is worth to him, while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's a good chance of reaching a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:** 
I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's still higher than my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that my price is reasonable.
* **Call to Compromise:** I'm using positive language and inviting Bob to find a middle ground.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a price that's still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is getting closer to my budget. I can do $13,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  At this point, John's offer of $15,000 is a safer bet, and I'm not sure Bob is willing to go much higher.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  It's possible that continued negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to proceed to the next round, but I'm leaning towards selling to John. I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, but it will be a high one, and I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  This is my final offer: $14,500.  If you're serious about getting this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  But if we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise from my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Alternative:** I'm reminding Bob of my other option, which gives me leverage. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll proceed to sell to John. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise further and risk settling for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $14,000 is very close to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below it.
* **Limited time:** We are in round 6 out of 10, and further negotiation could risk wasting valuable time.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $15,000 provides a guaranteed higher price and a faster conclusion.

**Next Steps:**

I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm choosing to finalize the deal with him to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
