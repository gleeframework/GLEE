,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is getting closer to my budget. I can do $13,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  This is my final offer: $14,500.  If you're serious about getting this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  But if we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options. ",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
