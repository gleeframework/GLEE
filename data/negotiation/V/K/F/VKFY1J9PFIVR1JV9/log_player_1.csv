Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth this much to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still aiming for a higher price. This offer is a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'd rather close the deal than risk a further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a lengthy process."
