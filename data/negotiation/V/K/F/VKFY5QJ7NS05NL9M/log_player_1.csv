Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 to be made from Bob.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to maximize her profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, knowing its value is significant to you. I propose a price of $1,350,000. This presents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit while recognizing its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why This Works**

* **High but Acceptable:** $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Alice's minimum, maximizing her potential earnings.  It leaves Bob with a $150,000 gain â€“ a strong incentive to accept.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes fairness and the inherent value, making the price more palatable to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While a higher price like $1,400,000 might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  A slightly lower, well-justified price increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
