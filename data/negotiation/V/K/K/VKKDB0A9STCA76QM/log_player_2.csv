Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750, but that's my final offer.  This is a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product at a price that's still significantly lower than what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her $11,750 offer. While she might be willing to negotiate a little more, the potential savings are minimal.  It makes more financial sense to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
