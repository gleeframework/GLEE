"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her starting price is already above your ideal limit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **You can always buy from John.** Having John as an alternative keeps you in a strong negotiating position."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  the value of this product to you is quite high, and I believe my initial offer reflects that more accurately.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.
