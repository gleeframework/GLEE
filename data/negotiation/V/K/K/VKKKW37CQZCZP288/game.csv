"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  the value of this product to you is quite high, and I believe my initial offer reflects that more accurately.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget while still offering you a good profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This product holds significant value, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. How about we settle at $1,090,000? This is my final offer.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
