"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my limits.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value of the product, but also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue to work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
