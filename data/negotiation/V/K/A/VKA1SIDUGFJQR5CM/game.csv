"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you have a minimum price in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? ",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not comfortable going below $82. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle this right now at $78? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",78.0,Bob,6,
