"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good one for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about $10,400?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's close this deal!",10400.0,Alice,5,
