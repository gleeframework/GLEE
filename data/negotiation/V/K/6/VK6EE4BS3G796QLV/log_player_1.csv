``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is still a decent amount, but I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $2,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $1,750,000, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price. It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping the price to $1,850,000, which is a significant concession. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is too low. I've already made significant concessions and I don't think I can get a better price from Bob.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale and it's enough to meet my minimum requirement."
