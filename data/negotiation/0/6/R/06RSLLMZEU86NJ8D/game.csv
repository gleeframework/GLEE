"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure it will be a game-changer for your business.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the significant value this product holds for you.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000. This offer is closer to what I can afford and still leaves you a good profit.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
