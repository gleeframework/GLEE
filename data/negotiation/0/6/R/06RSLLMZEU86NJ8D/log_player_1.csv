Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
