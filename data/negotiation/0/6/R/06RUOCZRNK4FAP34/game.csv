"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1400000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, your initial price is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $1275000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000. This is a reasonable compromise that should work for both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm going to stand firm at $1250000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get to a mutually beneficial deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to think about my next steps carefully. I'm willing to meet you at $1270000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1270000.0,Alice,7,
