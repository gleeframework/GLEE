"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $92.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product.  It's my final offer, I'm ready to walk away if this doesn't work.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $88, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $88, which would be $90.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. What do you think?",90.5,Alice,7,
