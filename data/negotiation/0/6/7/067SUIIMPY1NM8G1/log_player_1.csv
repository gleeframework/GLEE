Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I believe a price of $950,000 would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let's split the difference - $1,000,000 feels like a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  This would give you a solid profit while still providing me with a good deal compared to John's offer.  What do you say?
