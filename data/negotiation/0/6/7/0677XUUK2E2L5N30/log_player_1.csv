"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows that I'm confident in the product's worth.  It's a starting point that hopefully will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but your asking price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay firm in my value for the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. It shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe in the product's worth. I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating but won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I need to continue pushing for a price closer to my target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not enough for me. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $850,000 is a fair price that reflects its potential benefit for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's perceived value, but still protects my minimum acceptable price. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but also signals my firm stance on the product's worth. I hope this offer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
