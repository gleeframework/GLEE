"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I can't go lower than $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant savings over what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
