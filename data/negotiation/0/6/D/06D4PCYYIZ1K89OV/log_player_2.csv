{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's also worth exploring if you can get a better deal from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it aligns with my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price, or potentially go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $1,100,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since we're already halfway through the rounds, I don't have time to continue negotiating and risk getting stuck with a higher price.  It's better to buy from John and guarantee the product at my desired price."
