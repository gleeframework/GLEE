Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. He should try to get closer to his desired $1,000,000 mark."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1075000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping to get closer to $1,000,000,  $1,075,000 is a good deal considering he can always buy from John for $1,500,000.  There's a good chance Alice will not budge further and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal."
