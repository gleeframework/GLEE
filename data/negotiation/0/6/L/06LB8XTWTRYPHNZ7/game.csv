"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
