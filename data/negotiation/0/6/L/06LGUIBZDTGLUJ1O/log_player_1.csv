"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, but I'm hoping to get him to budge a little. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'm confident John is my backup if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting, I'm not willing to drop that much. I'll counter with a higher price, but if it doesn't work out, I'm confident I can get my desired price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but not significantly. This is a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  It's time to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm hoping Bob sees this as a good deal for him. I'm also hoping to get the deal done before I need to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will come up to my desired price. I've already dropped significantly and I'm running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so I'm going to take that option."
