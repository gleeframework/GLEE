Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Offering a price slightly higher than Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also ensures I get a good price. 
* **Highlighting the product's value:**  This encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially increase his own value assessment.

I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
