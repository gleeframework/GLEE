"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's intent to negotiate seriously.  $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice wants to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially achieving a price closer to Bob's goal.  It's worth trying to get closer to the $950,000 mark before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $950,000, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but it's a step towards a potential agreement. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and avoids a potential stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is still better than John's price, it's getting closer to Bob's upper limit.  However, there's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. He still has some room to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get closer to $1,100,000 before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's serious about buying the product. $1,150,000 is a significant compromise from his previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate while also keeping the price within his acceptable range."
