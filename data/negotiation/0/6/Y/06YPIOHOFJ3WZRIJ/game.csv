"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. My next counteroffer is $1,320,000. I'm confident this price is more in line with what you're willing to pay, while still allowing me to get a good deal.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
