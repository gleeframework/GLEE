"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,450,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's above your valuation, and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and significantly less than the $1,500,000 he would pay John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might walk away, and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
