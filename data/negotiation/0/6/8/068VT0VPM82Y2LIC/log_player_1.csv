Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  the value this product brings is substantial. I can come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is the best decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away or my demands becoming unrealistic. Accepting now guarantees a good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal quickly lets me re-invest the earnings sooner, potentially leading to further gains. 

While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, the certainty of securing $1,400,000 now outweighs a potential $100,000 gain with further negotiation."
