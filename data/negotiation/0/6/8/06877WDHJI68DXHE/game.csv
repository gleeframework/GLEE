"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and it would truly be a valuable asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth quite that much.  How about we bring the price down significantly to something more reasonable?  I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be frank, I'm considering other options that fit my budget more closely. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  That would make a big difference for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and respect your budget constraints.  However, I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering.  Let's make this work â€“ how about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
