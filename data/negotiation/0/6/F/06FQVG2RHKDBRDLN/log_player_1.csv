{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if needed.  $10,000 is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum price, but still potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $6,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200

While $7,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if it doesn't work out, I'll go with John's offer."

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me, and I'm worried that we're going to go back and forth forever. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which is above my minimum. I'm happy with that deal."
