"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is too low and doesn't leave any room for negotiation. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,000?  That gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we meet a little closer to my initial offer? I'm willing to pay $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still too low, especially considering Bob's initial offer and the fact that you have rounds remaining.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $8,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's fair to both of us, and allows for some room for a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting stuck at the same point.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $9,000 is still too high for me. How about $8,600? That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,600 is closer to your minimum and Bob has stated this is a firm offer, it's still worth continuing to negotiate. You have several rounds left, and you can potentially get a higher price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's still room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firmness, but $8,600 just doesn't work for me. Let's try to close the deal. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
