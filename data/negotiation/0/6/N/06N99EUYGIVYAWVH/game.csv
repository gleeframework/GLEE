"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'm happy to pay $900000 for the product, which still allows for a healthy profit for you. This reflects the value I see in the product and would enable a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however, and I'm ready to offer the product for $1000000. This price still provides a fair profit for you and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
