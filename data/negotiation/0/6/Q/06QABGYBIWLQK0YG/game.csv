"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
