Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your fallback price with John:** This ensures you make a profit greater than $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal and encourages him to accept.

**Why not go higher?**

While you could potentially ask for more, there's a risk Bob will reject the offer.  This offer is a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting."
