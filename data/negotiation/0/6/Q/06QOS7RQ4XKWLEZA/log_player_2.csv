"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is too expensive. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80, while staying aware of the $100 alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a lower price point.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it leaves room for further negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to her perceived value, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway between her current offer and my last one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down Alice, I appreciate it.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"", 
""product_price"": 77
}
```

This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and closer to her actual perceived value."
