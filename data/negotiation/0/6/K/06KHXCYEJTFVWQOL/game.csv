"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1250000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows for a fair transaction.  Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $1150000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, my absolute minimum, to close this deal. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us. I believe this is our best chance for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
