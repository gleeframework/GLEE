Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1250000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows for a fair transaction.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $1150000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, my absolute minimum, to close this deal. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us. I believe this is our best chance for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is now exactly your maximum budget. You could potentially continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  Given that John is also selling the product for $1,200,000, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
