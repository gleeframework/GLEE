Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
