"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. 
* **Justification:** I'm acknowledging the product's value but clearly stating my financial limitations. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for further negotiation without immediately cutting off the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I can get a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still outside my acceptable range.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to jump at a price that's so far from my target.  There's still room for Alice to drop her price, and I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but respectful:**  I'm reiterating my previous offer, demonstrating my seriousness without being overly aggressive. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Alice of the product's worth and that my offer is fair.
* **Emphasizing budget:** I'm making it clear that I have a set budget and won't go beyond it.

This approach aims to maintain a firm but fair position,  encouraging Alice to consider my offer seriously."
