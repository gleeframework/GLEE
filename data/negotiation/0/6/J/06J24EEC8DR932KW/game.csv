"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I can get a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
