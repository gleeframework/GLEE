"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to us and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start, let me propose a price of $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $8,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To move forward, I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both the value of the product to us and your budget constraints.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $8,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land. I'm willing to go to $7,750.  This shows my serious interest, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. In order to reach an agreement, I am willing to lower the price to $7,900 for the product. This is the best offer I can make while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us.",7900.0,Alice,5,
