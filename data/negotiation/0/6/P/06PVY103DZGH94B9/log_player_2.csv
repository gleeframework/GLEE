"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000, a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still above your desired price point.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try to get a better price. 
* **John is an option.**  While John's offer is your maximum, you want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe $1,400,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant investment for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a substantial return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has come down, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you can likely get a lower price.
* **John is a backup.**  You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you're not rushing into a decision."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and get this product into my hands."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,280,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your price.**  Her offer of $1,280,000 is only $30,000 above your last counteroffer.
* **This is her final offer.**  If you reject it, you risk her sticking to her price or even going back up.
* **John's price is still higher.** While you could buy from John, Alice's offer is a better deal at this point. 

You're getting a good price while still leaving a bit of room for Alice to feel she got a decent deal as well."
