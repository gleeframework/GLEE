"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be open to $475,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and allows me to stay within my budget.",475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $475,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",525000.0,Alice,5,
