"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't meet that price. How about $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap from this product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
