"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $75. I can do $85, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
