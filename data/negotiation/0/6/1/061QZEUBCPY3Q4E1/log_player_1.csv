"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm making a good profit, but still leaving room for potential compromise and leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $101.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  $101.25 is a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
