"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $850,000, which would be $975,000. This is the best I can do at this time.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $900,000? I think that's a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can do $925,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the lowest price I can accept to sell the product to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
