{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $120, but not excessively high, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and open to negotiation, aiming to start a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss.  I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $130? This would still allow me to make a decent profit while hopefully being a fair price for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $115 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still lower than my minimum of $120, but it's close enough. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him, and it's closer to my minimum than John's offer.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
