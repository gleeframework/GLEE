Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is too far below my desired value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This is a good deal for both of us.
