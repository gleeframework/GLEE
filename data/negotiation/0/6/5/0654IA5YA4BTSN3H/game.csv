"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is too far below my desired value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This is a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,275,000. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,275,000 is tempting, I'm still committed to getting a price closer to $1,350,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your commitment to getting a price closer to $1,350,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $1,312,500. Can you consider that?",1312500.0,Bob,6,
