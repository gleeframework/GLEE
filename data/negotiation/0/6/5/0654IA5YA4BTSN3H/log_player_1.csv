Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $1,275,000. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,275,000 is tempting, I'm still committed to getting a price closer to $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting very close to my target and we're in the middle of the negotiation.  There's a good chance I won't get a higher offer in the next few rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $1,312,500 is a good outcome considering John's offer."
