"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand $8000 is your current offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. Would you consider $8500?,8500.0,Bob,4,
