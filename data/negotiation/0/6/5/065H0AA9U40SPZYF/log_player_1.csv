"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand $8,000 is your current offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. Would you consider $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and I'm getting closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer seems like the best option in this round."
