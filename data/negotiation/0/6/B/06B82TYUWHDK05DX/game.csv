"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
