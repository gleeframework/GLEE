"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. How about we bring it down to $850,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and your own cost.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  To be totally transparent, I'm working with a tight budget on this project.  Would you be willing to settle at $900,000? That's a substantial sum and would allow me to move forward with this purchase.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
