"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $80, but not that much. How about we meet at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $82.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $82.50, which would be $83.75. What do you think?",83.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $82.50. I'm willing to meet you at that price, so I'm sticking with my previous offer. Can we finalize the deal at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $82.50 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $84. What do you think?",84.0,Alice,7,
