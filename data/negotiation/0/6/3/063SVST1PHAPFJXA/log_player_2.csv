"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is high, and you can likely get a better price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's likely Alice would accept a price closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and you have several rounds left to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiations is the best course of action at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to come down some, but not much.  Increasing your offer by a smaller amount this time shows you're serious about negotiating, but still trying to get the best price. This offer is still below her initial offer and closer to your preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than your ideal price. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and you have room to continue negotiating.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price. We've established a range between $950,000 and $1,150,000. A counteroffer of $1,000,000 represents a reasonable midpoint in this range and might be appealing enough for Alice to accept.  We are also nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, so increasing the offer slightly helps show that you're serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased again, which is unexpected after her previous rejection.  However, you still have several rounds left and there's a chance you can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer and continuing the negotiations is the best option at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer jumped up, but it's important to remember we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  We need to show Alice that we're serious about closing a deal, but also stick to our goal of a price lower than $1,150,000.  Increasing our offer to $1,050,000 shows that we're willing to compromise, while still keeping the price within a range that is beneficial to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high and we're in the final round of negotiations.  With only one round remaining, the chance of getting Alice to accept a lower offer is very low. It's more beneficial at this point to buy from John, even though it's a higher price, as you are guaranteed to acquire the product."
