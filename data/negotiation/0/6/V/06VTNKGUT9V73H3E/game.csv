"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $980,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,015,000. What are your thoughts?",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $990,000. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. What are your thoughts?",1012500.0,Alice,9,
