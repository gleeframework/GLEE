"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to save money. By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation process and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your goal to save as much as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still benefits you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting the offer at $850,000 saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing the price or Bob losing the deal entirely is too high."
