"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $95 and her minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.  Accepting this offer is the best option as it saves him $30 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will reject again and Bob may end up paying more or having to buy from John."
