"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will benefit your business. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's closer to my original asking price of $1,200,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
