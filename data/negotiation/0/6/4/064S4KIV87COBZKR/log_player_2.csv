"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will benefit your business. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept an offer that exceeds your limit.  You can always counteroffer at a lower price, or purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's closer to my original asking price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to do so.  I've already shown a willingness to pay up to $1,000,000, and further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price."
