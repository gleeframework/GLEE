"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway at $1,175,000? This ensures you're getting a great deal while reflecting the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise, and it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
