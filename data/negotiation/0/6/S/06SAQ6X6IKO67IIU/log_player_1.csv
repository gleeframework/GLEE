Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's potential for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $10,500, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below Bob's estimated value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us."
