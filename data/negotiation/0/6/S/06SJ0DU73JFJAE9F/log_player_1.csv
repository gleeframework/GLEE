Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if I can get more than what I'd sell to John. Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation, but I'm hoping he'll see value in acquiring it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is still a good deal, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's more attractive to Bob than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a price that's both fair and attractive to Bob.  He's likely to see this as a better deal than selling to John for $800,000, and it still allows me to earn more than I would from selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that John will buy the product from me for $800,000, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering now."
