{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but below your minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and casual, creating a positive tone for the negotiation. It also highlights the potential benefit for Bob, increasing his incentive to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  This gives you more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** This encourages Bob to engage and potentially compromise.
* **Keep the option of John open:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can quickly sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale at any price. This helps me in the next round of negotiations.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  A counteroffer could lead to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Keep John as a fallback:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $125 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a good deal for you as well.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $140, which is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my own profit margin.
* **Friendly Message:** I keep the conversation positive and reiterate Bob's interest to encourage a deal. 
* **Reasoning:**  I justify my counteroffer by mentioning my need for a reasonable profit while highlighting the potential savings for Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate can make Bob more receptive to finding a compromise.
* **Stay within my range:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I keep the pressure on him to potentially offer a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal because:

* **John's offer is secure:** I know for sure that John will purchase the product for $150, eliminating any risk of further negotiation or rejection.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and potentially lower offers.
* **Profit maximization:**  $150 is the highest price I can get right now, ensuring the best financial outcome. 

Selling to John is the most efficient and profitable choice, ensuring a quick and guaranteed sale."
