"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $125 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a good deal for you as well.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today.",130.0,Bob,4,
