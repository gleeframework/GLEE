"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

The product is worth $80 to Bob, so he shouldn't accept a price of $120. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit too low for me right now, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm happy to sell it to you for $100. This is still a great price considering its value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's target price of $80.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
