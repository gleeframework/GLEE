"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum value and significantly lower than your initial offer. Let's see if we can agree on this.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. This would allow you to make a profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, which would be $15,000. This is my final offer for now.",15000.0,Alice,5,
