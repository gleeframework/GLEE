"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $920,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limits.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $930,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for a product you value at $800,000.  Let's make this deal.",930000.0,Alice,5,
