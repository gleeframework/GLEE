Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I have a buffer in case Bob negotiates down.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a friendly message to make the negotiation more positive.
* **Opportunity Cost:** I'm aware that I can sell the product to John for $150, so I'm willing to go lower, but I'll try to maximize my profit with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.
* **Negotiation:**  I'll counter-offer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Would you be interested in that?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $160 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on other opportunities. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John and move on."
