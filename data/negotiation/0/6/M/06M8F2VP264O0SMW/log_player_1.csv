Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  It also acknowledges that Bob's value for the product is lower than mine.  

I will be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'll be ready to move on to John if the negotiations become too time-consuming or the offers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't come close to the value I place on the product.  I will reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I want to see if there's any room for negotiation before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a more substantial increase in his offer before I consider accepting.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I'm getting closer to that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth, and it also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts on this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
