"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'll gauge his reaction and adjust accordingly in future rounds.  If he rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go. But I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John if the price is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to compromise a bit, but still aiming for a decent profit.  This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will get him closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob seems determined to stick to his $1,200,000 price.  I'm not ready to give in yet.  I'll see if I can push him a little higher in the next round. If he still refuses, I might need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a little more, but I'm still holding out for a bit more than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal with him, but I'm not willing to sell for my absolute minimum. I'm keeping my eye on John just in case this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer slightly, and we're now only $50,000 apart.  I'm getting close to my minimum, and I'm concerned I might lose the deal if I keep rejecting.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, and it's worth taking the slightly lower price to ensure a deal."
