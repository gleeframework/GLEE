{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to do $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
