"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I want to be fair. How about we settle at $780,000? That's a significant step towards your price, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $780,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $815,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $800,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,8,
