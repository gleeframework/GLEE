"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed. 
*  The offer is significantly higher than John's offer, so I'm incentivized to continue negotiating with Bob. 
*  This first offer is a starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  
* **I have 10 rounds and a backup offer from John.** This gives me leverage to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to push the price higher.**  I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to ensure I don't lose Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm aiming for a compromise. My offer is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but significantly lower than my initial offer.
* This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
*  This is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving up on getting a better deal.
* I'm hoping Bob will recognize the compromise and accept this offer to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price and above my minimum acceptable price.** 
* I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation, showing flexibility. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* The risk of rejecting and making another counteroffer is that Bob might walk away, or we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* Selling to John would be a lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this round."
