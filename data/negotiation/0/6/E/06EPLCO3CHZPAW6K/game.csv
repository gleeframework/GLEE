"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product is $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
