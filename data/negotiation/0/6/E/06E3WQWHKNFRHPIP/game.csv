"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your budgetary considerations.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
