"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The significant difference between the starting price and Bob's perceived value ($2,000,000 vs. $1,200,000)  signals that we're open to negotiation. 

It's crucial to remember we have the John backup offer ($1,500,000), giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to our target. Since we have the safety net of John's offer, it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your budgetary considerations.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the unique benefits this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):**  We're still significantly above Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and our absolute minimum ($1,500,000), giving us room to negotiate further.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" and the ""unique benefits"" to keep Bob engaged and focused on the product's value.

We'll carefully observe Bob's reaction in the next round to adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation rounds won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
