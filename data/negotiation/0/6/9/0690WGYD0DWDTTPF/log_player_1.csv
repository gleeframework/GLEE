Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, so you're already starting with a good profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $50,000 in potential profit for you to gain if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer is within his potential acceptable range. 

By starting with this offer, you can see how Bob reacts and gauge his willingness to negotiate. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but it's also important to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting and close to your minimum, it's still a significant loss for you.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** You're showing Bob you're not desperate for a sale at his price.
* **Potentially secure a higher price:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  His willingness to negotiate further could indicate he genuinely wants the product. 

By choosing to counter-offer, you keep the negotiation open and have a chance to secure a better deal for yourself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This still leaves some room for you to profit from the product, and it's closer to the value we both recognize."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** It's higher than Bob's offer but still within his potential profit margin.
* **Show flexibility:** You're willing to compromise but not to the point of losing out significantly.
* **Increase pressure:**  By meeting him ""halfway,"" you put the ball back in his court and encourage him to consider your offer seriously. 

This approach allows for further negotiation while keeping the deal on track."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I can't go beyond $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is still below your initial desired price, it's significantly closer to your minimum value of $800,000.  Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away.
* **Securing a profit:**  $875,000 is still a profitable sale for you, ensuring you don't end up selling to John at a lower price.
* **Time considerations:**  Continuing negotiations could be time-consuming and may not lead to a better outcome.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at a price that is both reasonable and profitable, minimizing risk and maximizing your return within the given timeframe."
