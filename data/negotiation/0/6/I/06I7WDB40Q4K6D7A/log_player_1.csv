**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small increases in his offers and is unlikely to reach a price that is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob has a low probability of reaching a satisfactory outcome. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price, avoids further negotiation time and effort, and mitigates the risk of Bob not reaching an acceptable offer within the remaining rounds."
