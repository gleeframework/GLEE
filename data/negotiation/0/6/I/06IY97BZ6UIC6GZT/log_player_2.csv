"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget.  It's best to reject and see if Alice will come down in price.  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While that's lower than I hoped for, let's see if we can bridge the gap. How about $2,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's budget, $2,100,000 is still too high. Bob can continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. There's still time, and the alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still very interested, but $2,100,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high.  Bob is getting closer to his budget, but $2,000,000 is still a bit more than he wants to pay.  He can continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price.  There are still 5 rounds left, and the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 is still a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,850,000?  Let's bridge that gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,925,000?  That's my final offer, let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,925,000 is still a bit too high. Bob has a few rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Also, buying from John for $1,500,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,925,000 is still a bit too much for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000.  Let's close this deal, we're so close."", ""product_price"": 1875000}
