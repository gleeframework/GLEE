I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm also considering that selling to John would only net me $1,200,000, so I'm motivated to keep negotiating with Bob."

At this point, Bob's offer matches John's offer.  I've already exhausted all my options for getting a higher price from Bob. To avoid risking losing the deal altogether, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and secure a sale."
