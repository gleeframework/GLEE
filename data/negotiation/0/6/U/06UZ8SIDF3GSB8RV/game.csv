"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $15500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15250? That's closer to your offer and would still make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",15250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15250 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $15250, which would be $14625. Can we do that?",14625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm still hopeful for a price closer to $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $14937.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a great value for you.",14937.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14937.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to meet you at a price that's closer to $14000. How about $14500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
