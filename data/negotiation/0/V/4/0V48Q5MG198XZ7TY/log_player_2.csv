"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. It's priced at $1,200,000, which represents a significant savings compared to its true value. While I'm confident this is a fantastic deal, I understand you may have other considerations. If you decide it's not the right fit, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to acquire it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a much lower price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the possibility of her coming back with a lower counter-offer. Even if she doesn't, you're still securing a better deal with John."
