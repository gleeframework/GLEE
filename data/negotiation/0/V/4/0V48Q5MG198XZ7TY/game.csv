"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business. It's priced at $1,200,000, which represents a significant savings compared to its true value. While I'm confident this is a fantastic deal, I understand you may have other considerations. If you decide it's not the right fit, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to acquire it. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
