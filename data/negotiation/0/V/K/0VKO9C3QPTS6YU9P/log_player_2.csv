"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $950,000 is a significant discount from the product's value to Alice, but it's still a lot of money.
* **Exploring options is always wise.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get a better price. If he can't, he can always go with John's offer in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still gives her a substantial profit and shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially set the stage for a quick resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility.** Her counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for a better deal.** While $925,000 is a good price, Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal by continuing the negotiation.
* **Managing risk:**  Rejecting the offer doesn't mean Bob is committed to a lower price; he can always opt for John's offer if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but staying firm:**  $910,000 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer signals that Bob is determined to secure a deal but won't overpay. It puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing a good offer.
* **Approaching the middle ground:**  This offer moves the price closer to the middle point between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer, increasing the likelihood of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress towards a deal:**  Alice has raised her offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reaching a fair price:**  $930,000 is a good price for Bob, giving him a significant discount while still allowing Alice to make a profit.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, especially if Alice is unwilling to go lower.  Accepting this offer secures a deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
