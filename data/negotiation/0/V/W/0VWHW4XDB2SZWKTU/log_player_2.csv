Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  How about $1,250,000? This price reflects a compromise that could be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're getting close to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a mutually beneficial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice has met John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.  It's best to buy from John at this point."
