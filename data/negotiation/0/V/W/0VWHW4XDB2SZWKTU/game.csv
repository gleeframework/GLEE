"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  How about $1,250,000? This price reflects a compromise that could be beneficial for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a mutually beneficial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
