"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to explore other options before selling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  How about $1,250,000? This price reflects a compromise that could be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my preferred target. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The alternative of selling to John for $1,500,000 is still available if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a mutually beneficial offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
