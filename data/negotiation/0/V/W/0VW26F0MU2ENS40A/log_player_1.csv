""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $200.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is offering the absolute maximum he perceives the product to be worth.  There's no room for further negotiation with him. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
