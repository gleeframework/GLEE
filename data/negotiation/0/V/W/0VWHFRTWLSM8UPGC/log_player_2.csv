Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her lowest:** She explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is the lowest she's willing to go.
* **This is her value:**  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. It's unlikely she'll go below her own valuation. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While you have rounds left, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal. Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk her walking away. 

Accepting now secures you the product at a good price, saving you $300,000 compared to John's offer."
