"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $15000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $12500, which is my final offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $12500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
