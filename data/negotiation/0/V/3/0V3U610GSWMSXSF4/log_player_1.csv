Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $120 might be too aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection. $119 leaves a small window for potential haggling, should Bob attempt it. 
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:**  My fallback offer from John is $100.  Selling to Bob at $119 guarantees a significantly better profit."
