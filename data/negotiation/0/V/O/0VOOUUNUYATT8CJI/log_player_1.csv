Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm offering $165. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $155 is a good compromise. It's a fair price, and I'm happy to finalize the deal."
