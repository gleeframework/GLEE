Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (her minimum acceptable price). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below $12,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Starting too low (e.g., $10,000) might offend Bob and make him less likely to negotiate.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While John is a guaranteed sale, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit. 

This offer balances getting a good price from Bob with the security of knowing John will buy it for $12,000 if needed."
