{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a safety net with John's offer, so you can afford to be more aggressive in your counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to negotiate and potentially secure a good deal. It's also important to note that I'm still leaving room for negotiation, as I'm well below my maximum budget."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, even though it's a step down from her initial offer. I'm still determined to save as much as I can and see if I can negotiate a better deal. It's possible Alice is willing to come down further, and John's offer provides me with a solid backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer, but still remaining below my maximum budget.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to overpay. I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, and this counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate.  While I could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and I might end up buying from John at the same price. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
