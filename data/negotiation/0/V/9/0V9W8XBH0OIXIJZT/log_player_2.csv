"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $80, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

Starting with a lower counteroffer will test the waters and see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.  We'll see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is willing to negotiate, but she's still above our ideal price. Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're moving closer to our target price of $60. A counteroffer of $65 is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Alice bites!"

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $68 is a good price, it's still not our target. Let's see if we can get Alice to go lower with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 63} 
```

We're getting close! A counteroffer of $63 is a small jump from our target price of $60, and it might be enough to convince Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $66. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $66
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to our target price, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting the offer for $66 is a good deal, saving us a significant amount compared to buying from John."
