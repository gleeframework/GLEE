"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting our negotiation at $110. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving him ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer at $107. This is higher than my initial offer, aiming for a mutual agreement. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to adjust your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has lowered her offer to $107, Bob is still better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate. He has 7 rounds remaining and the potential to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $105. Let's try $106 as a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to agree on a price of $108. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is only $3 more than Bob's initial target of $105.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying the full $120 to John.  Accepting the offer at $108 secures a good deal within Bob's budget and allows him to save a significant amount compared to John's price."
