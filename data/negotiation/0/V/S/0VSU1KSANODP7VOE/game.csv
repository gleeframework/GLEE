"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",105.0,Bob,6,
