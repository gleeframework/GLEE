"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $2,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still allows me to get a decent return on this product. Let's find a middle ground!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still below what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
