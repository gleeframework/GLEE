Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows good faith by not immediately going for the full $12,000.  It's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his last offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed price."
