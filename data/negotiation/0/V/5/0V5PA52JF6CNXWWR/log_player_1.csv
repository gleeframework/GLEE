Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Value Perception:** Offering a higher price might make the product seem more desirable or valuable to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject a higher offer. However, the potential for increased profit outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
