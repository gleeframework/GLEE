{""message"": ""That's a great start, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above your target price, but you've reached a point where you're running out of rounds.  It's better to accept her offer than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at $10,000. You've saved $1,000 compared to John's offer, which is a good outcome."
