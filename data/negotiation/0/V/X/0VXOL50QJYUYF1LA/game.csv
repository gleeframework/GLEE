"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if the product is worth $175 to me.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,4,
