"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140, which is a better deal.
* **You're still getting a good price:** You're saving $10 compared to buying from John, and you're getting the product for less than your maximum value."
