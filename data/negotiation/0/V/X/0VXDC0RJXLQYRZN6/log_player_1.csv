Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit slightly. 
* **Backup Option:** We have John as a guaranteed backup at $100, so we don't want to offer a price lower than that to Bob.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your profit, as he is willing to pay more than your backup option (John)."
