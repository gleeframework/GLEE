"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the $120 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but is higher than her minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $95? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can still negotiate a lower price. Alice has shown willingness to budge, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a middle ground, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
