"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $95? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  This is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
