"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000? That's still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  This price allows you to acquire the product for a significant value, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
