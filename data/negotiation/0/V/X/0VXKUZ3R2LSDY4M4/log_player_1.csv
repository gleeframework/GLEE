"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000? That's still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  This offer considers the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a reasonable return.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  This price allows you to acquire the product for a significant value, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,187,500?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,187,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've had 6 rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we're still too far apart in our pricing.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer."
