Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a decent margin above my minimum, but it's also a price that might encourage Bob to negotiate. I want to see if he's truly interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. It's still a good deal for me, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm not confident that he will ever come close to my minimum, and I don't want to waste more time negotiating. It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
