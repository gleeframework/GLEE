Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer on price, which is good.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $985,000 for the product.  This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're making progress, but $985,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm ready to offer $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, but we are still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.  I believe there is still room to negotiate and secure a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a more significant move to reach an agreement. Let's aim for a win-win: I'm willing to accept $970,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 970000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. By stating this is my final offer, I'm applying pressure to Bob to make a serious decision.  I've come down in price, but not too drastically, aiming to keep the deal attractive for myself while encouraging Bob to accept."
