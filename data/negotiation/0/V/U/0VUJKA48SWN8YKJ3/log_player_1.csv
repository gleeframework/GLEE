Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000, so you're leaving some space for a compromise.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value while being open to negotiation. 

I'm choosing to start the negotiation with a slightly higher price to see if Bob will counter with a lower offer. This way, I can potentially get closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price. I want to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think it's a fair compromise, and it'll allow both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no higher. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. 

Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more beneficial for me to sell to him. This will ensure I get the best possible price for the product."
