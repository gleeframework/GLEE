"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and is still fair considering your interest. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's worth the same to me. This way we both come out ahead.",10000.0,Bob,4,
