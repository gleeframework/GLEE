Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $135 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $125. I'm willing to come down to $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $130 is still a little too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $128. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $130,  Bob's offer of $128 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my goal of earning more than $120."
