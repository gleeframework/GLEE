"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,250? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,
