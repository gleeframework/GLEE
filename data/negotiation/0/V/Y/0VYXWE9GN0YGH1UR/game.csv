"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still not enough for me.  I'm prepared to go a bit lower, but let's try $8,250.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing the value but I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $7,900? This is my final offer.",7900.0,Bob,6,
