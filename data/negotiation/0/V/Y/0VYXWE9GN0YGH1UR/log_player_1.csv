Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still not enough for me.  I'm prepared to go a bit lower, but let's try $8,250.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Bob's offer is still too low, and with only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. It's better to secure the $8,000 sale with John and move on."
