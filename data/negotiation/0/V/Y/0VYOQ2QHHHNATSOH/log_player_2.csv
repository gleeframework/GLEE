"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $12,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. There's no reason to accept this initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to get a good deal.  He's not afraid to walk away, so he's setting a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $10,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above his target price of $8,000. He can still get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his ideal price and Alice's offer.  He's showing that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to be reasonable, but he's still holding firm to his goal of staying under $8,000."
