"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer that's slightly higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,""  you subtly remind Bob of its worth to him, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than simply accepting or rejecting your initial offer. 

**Goal:** The aim is to secure a price as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while keeping in mind the $800,000 backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of the product. Bob's initial offer was likely a negotiation tactic, and there's room to negotiate further for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):**  By suggesting a price of $1,050,000, we're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This common negotiation tactic can be persuasive, as it suggests fairness and a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  We're still positioning the product as having a high value, hoping to nudge Bob closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we possibly agree on $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress! Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to pay more than his initial offer. However, we still have room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more while encouraging him to make another, hopefully closer to our target, counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm flexible, I can come down to $1,025,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the value this product will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our price by a smaller increment this time ($25,000 instead of $50,000), signaling that we're nearing our limit.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We continue to emphasize the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits it offers and justifying the higher price.
* **Striking a Balance:** Our goal is to find a middle ground where we secure a significant profit without pushing Bob away. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price above $1 million."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! While $975,000 is tempting, we're still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product. We've made steady progress in the negotiation, and with five rounds remaining, we have a decent chance of pushing for a slightly higher price.  We'll risk losing Bob on this one to aim for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. If you meet me halfway at $1,000,000, we have an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We're drawing a line in the sand at $1,000,000. This presents a strong stance while still offering a compromise. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Phrasing like ""Let's close this deal"" injects a sense of urgency and finality into the negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Clean Number:** A round number like $1,000,000 is psychologically appealing and might be more readily accepted. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** While not the absolute highest we could get, $1,000,000 represents a significant profit and a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $985,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. Bob has consistently increased his offer, and we've reached a point of diminishing returns. Here's why accepting $985,000 makes sense:

* **Excellent Profit:**  This price still represents a substantial profit margin ($185,000) over our minimum acceptable offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for more risks losing the deal entirely. We could end up with John's $800,000 offer or nothing if Bob walks away.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we receive the money sooner, allowing us to reinvest or utilize it elsewhere. 
 
While we could try for a bit more, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing a significant profit. Accepting $985,000 represents a strong and pragmatic outcome for us in this negotiation."
