"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,500,  considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move in Round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target than $11,500, it's still above his desired price point of $10,000.  Bob has 7 rounds remaining and it's beneficial to continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to offer $10,750.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, I can't go below $10,900.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $900 above Bob's desired price point of $10,000.  Considering Bob has only 5 rounds remaining and John's price of $12,000, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. It allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price, maximizing his savings compared to purchasing from John."
