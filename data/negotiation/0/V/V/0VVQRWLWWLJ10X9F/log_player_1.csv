Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm sure you'll still find this a great deal for the value you'll get out of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.
