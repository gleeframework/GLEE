"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  While $10,000 is still a little high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $7,000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows me to get a good return on my investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,
