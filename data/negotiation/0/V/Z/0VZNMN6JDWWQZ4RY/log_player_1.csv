{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground, leaving room for negotiation but also aiming for a decent profit.  Since I know Bob values the product at $80, I'm hoping he'll see $100 as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $85 is still below my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob is unwilling to come up to a price that's acceptable to me.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best option at this point."
