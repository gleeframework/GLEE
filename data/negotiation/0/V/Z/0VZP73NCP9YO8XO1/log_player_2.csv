"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and unique aspects of this product.  I could consider coming down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $975,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $762,500? "",
""product_price"": 762500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $762,500 is closer to a realistic price, I can't quite agree to that number just yet.  Let's try $890,000.  This feels like a significant move on my end and reflects the value this product will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above John's offer of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk that we won't reach an agreement, and we'll end up with no product.  Buying from John guarantees we get the product at a price we know is acceptable."
