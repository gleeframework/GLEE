"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. To move forward, I propose we set the product price at $107. This is slightly above your offer but still within your budget. I believe this will be a fair compromise.",107.0,Alice,3,
