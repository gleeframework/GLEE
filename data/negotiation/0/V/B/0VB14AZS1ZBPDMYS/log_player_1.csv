Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a higher price for me.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to buy for $120 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $130 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing the sale completely.  He might walk away, and while John is a backup option, he's not ideal.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed to lead to a better outcome. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my minimum and avoids potential delays and uncertainty."
