"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget.
