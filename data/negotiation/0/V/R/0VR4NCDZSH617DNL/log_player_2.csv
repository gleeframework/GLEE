"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and John is selling the product for that exact amount, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. There's no chance of getting a better price from Alice, and negotiating further only risks losing the opportunity to buy from John."
