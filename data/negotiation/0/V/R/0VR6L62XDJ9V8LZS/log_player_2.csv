"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a special price of $10,000. This is a great deal as it's significantly lower than what I would typically sell it for.  It's a valuable product, worth well over $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise to make this work for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
