"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $5,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",5500.0,Alice,3,
