Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $5,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $5,250, a saving of $2,750 from Alice's initial offer and $2,750 from John's price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $5,250.  The potential savings from further negotiation are probably not worth the risk of her walking away or the time invested."
