"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,200?",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,200 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $12,800. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,800. How about $12,400?",12400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $12,400 is still a little below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,600. I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, and it's the last compromise I'm willing to make.",12600.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,600. How about $12,300?",12300.0,Bob,8,
