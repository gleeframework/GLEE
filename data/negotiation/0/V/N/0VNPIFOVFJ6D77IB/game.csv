"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be fair to myself as well. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a reasonable profit, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975000. Can we talk about it?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 as a final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product can bring.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
