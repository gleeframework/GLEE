"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price of $14,000 a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $11,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This accounts for the product's true value while still offering you a significant benefit.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  To be frank, I'm aiming to keep my spending under $12,000. How about we settle at $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11750.0,Bob,4,
