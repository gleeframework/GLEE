"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's initial offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This accounts for the product's true value while still offering you a significant benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target, aiming to meet somewhere in between."
