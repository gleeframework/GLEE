I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."

While Bob is getting closer, I'm not sure if we can reach a deal that's good for both of us. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value."
