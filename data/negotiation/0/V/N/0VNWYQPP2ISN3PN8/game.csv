"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we discuss a price closer to $1,000,000? I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I'm hoping for a price that aligns better with my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you while giving me a fair return.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your offer, Alice, and while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,150,000 is still quite high for me. I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to me and your need for a return.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your reduction to $1,100,000, but I'm still not able to meet you at that price point. I'm hoping for something closer to $1,075,000. This would allow us to strike a balance between the product's value to me and my financial constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've carefully considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate your effort to meet my needs, I'm still not able to accept $1,087,500. I propose we aim for $1,080,000. This would represent a significant compromise and would be a fair price for both parties. I hope you can see the merit in this proposal.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
