"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product seems like a great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer the product for $1,050,000? This price still leaves a healthy profit margin for you and allows me to move forward with the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $950,000? That would be a great price for both of us, don't you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This offer still gives you a great value for the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $925,000? That would be a great price for both of us, don't you think?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go lower than $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's try to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're both getting close to a deal. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. This offer gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to reach a fair price. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll offer $925,000 one more time. If you can meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John.",925000.0,Bob,10,
