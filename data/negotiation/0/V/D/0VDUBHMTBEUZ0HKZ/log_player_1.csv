Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation. This initial offer aims to:

* **Test Bob's interest:** A high starting price can gauge how eager Bob is to buy.
* **Leave room to negotiate:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can gradually lower the price while still aiming for a profit.

It's important to project confidence in your product and the offered price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $90 is below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value ($100).  This indicates room for negotiation. You'll reject his offer to signal you're looking for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm on getting a price closer to your minimum.  
* **Middle Ground:** $110 is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Justification:** By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you present the offer as fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $105? This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $100. While you could try to push for a slightly higher amount, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's generally better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially small gain."
