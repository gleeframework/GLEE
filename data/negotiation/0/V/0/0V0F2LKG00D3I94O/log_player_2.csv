{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than John's price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you the chance to potentially push Alice further down towards your target price. It's worth trying to see if you can secure a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that you are willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a price closer to your target.  This could potentially lead to a final agreement that benefits both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to your limit, but it's still above your ideal price range. At this point, you've had several rounds of negotiation, and Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price, and you risk getting stuck in a stalemate. Buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees you the product while still staying within your budget."
