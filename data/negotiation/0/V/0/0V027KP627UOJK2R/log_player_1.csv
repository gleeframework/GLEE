Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be flexible and willing to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $108.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $2 away.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer, but it's not guaranteed.  Accepting his offer is the most logical choice, as it secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
