Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It emphasizes the value of the product without being aggressive. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm setting the stage for a negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer, while still ensuring I get at least $120 (by selling to John). This allows me to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially earning more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I'd like to make you an offer of $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away. This increases my bargaining power and could lead to a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  The product is worth more than $100 to me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to Bob's offer:** $110 is a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate but not willing to accept his original offer.
* **The message is still friendly and encouraging:**  Reiterating ""fair price"" for both of us keeps the negotiation positive. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It bridges the gap between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By demonstrating flexibility and remaining optimistic, I hope to close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range."
