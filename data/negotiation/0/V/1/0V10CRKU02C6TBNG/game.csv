"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value you'll get from this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $950,000 to make it work for me. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $975,000 to make it work for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
