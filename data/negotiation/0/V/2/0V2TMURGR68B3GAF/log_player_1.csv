"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $13,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll see the potential of the product and be willing to negotiate. I'll be prepared to lower my price if needed, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, even though it's better than nothing. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully he'll see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $12,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if I don't see a reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair, given the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've made significant concessions, and it's clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob."
