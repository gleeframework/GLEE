Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,000 is too low for me right now."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
