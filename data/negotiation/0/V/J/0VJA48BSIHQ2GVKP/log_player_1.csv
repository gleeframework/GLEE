Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and persuasive. I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value proposition. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my price down slightly, but still aim to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. However, I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not under immense pressure to sell to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get closer to my target price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my own valuation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my valuation. Let's compromise at $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my desire for a fair compromise. I'm also reiterating the value proposition for him.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiation, but I'm not desperate to sell at a drastically lower price. It's likely to lead to further negotiation, but I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $875,000 is still significantly below my valuation. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to take the risk of another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To show you my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves me with a reasonable profit.  I truly believe this is the best we can do. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $925,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my valuation and gives me a better return than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm expressing appreciation for Bob's willingness to negotiate and highlighting the fact that this is a fair compromise. I'm emphasizing the value to him and  framing this as a win-win situation.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer signals my flexibility, while still maintaining a firm position. It is a risk, but I believe that the potential reward of a slightly higher price outweighs the risk of Bob rejecting and me potentially selling to John."
