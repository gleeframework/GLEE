"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1000000. Considering the product's unique features and potential returns, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
