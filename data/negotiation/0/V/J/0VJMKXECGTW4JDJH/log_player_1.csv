Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's close to John's offer:**  If Bob rejects, you can easily switch to John without taking a significant loss.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than your minimum value of $10,000. It's also far below the price you offered, so Bob is likely trying to push for a low price. You have leverage because John is willing to pay your minimum, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategically sound:

* **Middle ground:** It's a compromise, moving you halfway between your initial offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,000).
* **Still above Bob's value:** This gives him an incentive to consider your offer.
* **Not too far from your minimum:** It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $8750. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below the $10,000 you could get from John. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to squeeze more out of Bob, and you risk wasting time in a lengthy negotiation. It's time to play it safe and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm going to have to pass on your offer.  I've had another buyer come forward who is willing to pay my asking price.  I wish you the best in your search for this product."", ""product_price"": 0} 
``` 

It's time to end the negotiation with Bob.  There's no need to counteroffer further.  By telling Bob you have another buyer willing to pay your asking price, you are subtly putting pressure on him to increase his offer. However, you're not giving him the opportunity to counteroffer. You're closing the deal with John and securing the maximum profit."
