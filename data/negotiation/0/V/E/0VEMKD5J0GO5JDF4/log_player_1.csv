I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher initial offer gives me a better chance of getting closer to Bob's $12,000 valuation.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering less than Bob's full valuation creates space for a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a backup option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell the product to John for $10,000."
