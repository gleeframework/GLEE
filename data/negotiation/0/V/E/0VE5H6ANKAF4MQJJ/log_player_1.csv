"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm not sure what Bob values the product at, so I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can work down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer keeps going down, and while $700,000 is still a significant amount, it's not worth it to me to sell it for less than what John will pay.  I'll see if we can bridge the gap with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still holding out hope that Bob will come up a little bit more. It's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, he'll see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's not worth risking further negotiation when John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
