Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 wouldn't come close to reflecting that. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close! Your offer demonstrates a commitment to making this work. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our mutual desire to close a deal.

Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that works for you.  She's stated this is her final offer, and even with significant concessions on your part, she's still well above your $1,000,000 limit. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
