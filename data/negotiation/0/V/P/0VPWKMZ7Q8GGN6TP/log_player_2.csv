"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $140. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's value:** The product is worth $120 to Alice.
* **Alice's offer:** $140

Since Alice's offer is lower than your value ($150) and higher than her value ($120), it's a good deal for both of you. Accepting the offer allows you to save $10 compared to buying from John."
