Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm again increasing my offer slightly, this time to $14,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I believe that this is a fair compromise and that Alice is likely to accept it."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Alice has lowered the price again, it's still above my preferred price and I'm only at round 7 of 10. I believe there's still time to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since she's clearly willing to compromise."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $15,000, which is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer. I'm hoping this shows her that I'm serious about making a deal, and she might be willing to compromise at this point, especially since we are nearing the end of the negotiation."
