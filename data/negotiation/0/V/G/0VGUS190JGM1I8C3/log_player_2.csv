"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's wise to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to work with, providing ample opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement if we work together."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob needs to start his negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and acknowledges the product's worth to Alice.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By mentioning that he's ""confident we can reach a fair agreement,"" Bob demonstrates his commitment to finding a solution. 
* **Focus on value:**  While Bob's budget is $10,000, starting at $12,000 shows he recognizes the product's worth, making it more likely Alice will take his counteroffer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $18,000 is still above Bob's budget.  There's room to negotiate further, and Bob should aim to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $15,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I'm confident this is a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing towards a compromise:** Bob is now moving closer to Alice's last offer, but still staying within his negotiation range.  
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  By saying ""win-win situation,"" Bob emphasizes that this price is beneficial for both of them. This helps Alice feel like she's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** Bob isn't conceding too much at this stage, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
