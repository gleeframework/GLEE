Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a price that's likely to be appealing to Bob, as it's lower than what the product is worth to him. However, it also leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's closer to my ideal price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I will make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still allows for a bit of profit for me. If he accepts, I'll be happy with the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum. While I would prefer a higher price, there's no guarantee that he'll counter further, or that any subsequent counteroffers will be better.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and secures the sale, which is important to me."
