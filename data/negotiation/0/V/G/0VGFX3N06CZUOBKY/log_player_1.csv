Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still sees value in the purchase. Here's why:

* **Profit:** This offer gives me a profit of $1,500, which is better than selling to John.
* **Value for Bob:**  The price is still less than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000), so he's getting a good deal. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.

Let's see what Bob decides!"
