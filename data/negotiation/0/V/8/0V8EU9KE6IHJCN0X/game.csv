,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a bit high, considering my budget and the market value. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I've given this a lot of thought, and while I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers significant unique advantages. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges its true worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's unique advantages, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
