Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives him a strong incentive to buy while leaving me with a potential profit above my minimum. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a conversation and gauge Bob's interest.  It positions the price as potentially negotiable."
