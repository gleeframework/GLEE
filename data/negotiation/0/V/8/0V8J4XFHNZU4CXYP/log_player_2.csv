"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $12,000 is above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a lower offer, aiming to be aggressive but not so low that Alice will immediately reject it. This should hopefully encourage her to counter with a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal. I'm not desperate and have the option of buying from John for $10,000. I'll try to get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but still keeping it below my maximum budget.  This should encourage Alice to consider meeting me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still offering more than I'm comfortable with. I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'm also considering how many rounds are left and the risk of not getting a deal at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly, to show I'm serious but still within my budget. This is a compromise move, aiming to get Alice to meet me closer to the middle ground. With only 4 rounds left, it's time to push for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $11,200.  This is still above my ideal price, but with only 3 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'm willing to accept this price to ensure I get the product, especially since I can always buy it from John for $10,000 if I need to."
