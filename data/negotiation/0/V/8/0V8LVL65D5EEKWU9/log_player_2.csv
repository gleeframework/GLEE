{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a little lower than her previous offer, I'm still not comfortable paying that much.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John at $150 is still a better option, so I have some wiggle room."

```

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high.  I'm getting close to my limit of $150, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. Buying from John at $150 is the best option at this point."
