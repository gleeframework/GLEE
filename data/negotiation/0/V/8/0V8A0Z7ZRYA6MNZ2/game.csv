"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $500,000. This represents a fair starting point for our negotiation, and I believe it reflects the product's potential value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still significantly above what I'm comfortable paying.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $650,000.  I believe this demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the gap between our valuations.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, to be transparent, I have another buyer interested in purchasing this product for $1,000,000. To make this deal worthwhile for me, I need to see a significant jump in your offer this round. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging our ongoing negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm not comfortable with such a large jump in price. To be frank, if the price doesn't come down significantly, I'll have to consider John's offer. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a strong offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,6,
