{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $120. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round.  I'm not in a rush and I want to see if I can close the deal at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This is a fair price for a product that you value at the same amount.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
