"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This is a fair price for a product that you value at the same amount.  Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
