"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to do $14,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
