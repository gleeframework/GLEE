"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,000. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product. Let's meet in the middle again, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $7,750 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your efforts.  I'm still firm on needing at least $8,250 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think we can find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not willing to go above $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd be willing to pay $7,625 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",7625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $7,625 is just not enough for me.  I'm going to have to stick with my last offer of $8,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll reconsider.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",8250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your price, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,8,
