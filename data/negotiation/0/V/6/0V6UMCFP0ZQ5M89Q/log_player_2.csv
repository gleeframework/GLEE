"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal. If she doesn't offer a lower price, you can always buy from John for $120."
