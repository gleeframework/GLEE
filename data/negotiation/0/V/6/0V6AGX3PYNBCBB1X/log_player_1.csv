Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product.  A high starting point leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns,"" we aim to frame the product's worth in Bob's mind beyond just his initial valuation.
* **""Fair deal"" language:** This subtly anchors the negotiation around the idea of fairness, hopefully making Bob more receptive to a price closer to our desired range. 
* **Open to negotiation:** We don't want to scare Bob away. By saying ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts,"" we signal flexibility and invite a counter-offer.

**Goal:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, ideally closer to $1,300,000. If he rejects the offer, we have the security of John's offer at our minimum acceptable price."
