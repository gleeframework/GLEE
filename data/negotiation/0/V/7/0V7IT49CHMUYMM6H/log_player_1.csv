{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so it's not worth it to sell to him right now. I'll counteroffer with a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $110. I'd be willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $108 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $108 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $110?
