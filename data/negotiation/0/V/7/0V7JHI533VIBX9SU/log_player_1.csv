Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll see if I can get Bob closer to my asking price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price for you.  It allows me to get a fair price for the product, and it gives you a significant savings over what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000. How about $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,500 is a good deal for me and still leaves a significant profit margin.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely by pushing too hard."
