Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price range.  While it's a decrease, I'm still comfortable continuing the negotiation. There's still room for me to push for a lower price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $850,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
