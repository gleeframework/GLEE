"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is firmly above $725,000.  To settle this, I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a buyer lined up at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her absolute lowest price, matching John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's highly unlikely Alice will go any lower. Buying from John achieves the goal of getting the product at the best possible price without risking further negotiation rounds."
