"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is firmly above $725,000.  To settle this, I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a buyer lined up at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
