Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to profit from the sale. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer. 

However, remember that I have a backup option with John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,200,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $1,220,000 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to reconsider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000

While I'm still open to negotiating, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that John will pay my minimum, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profits."
