"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider a significantly lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, my valuation for this product is significantly higher based on its potential and the value it offers.  I could consider coming down to $975,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to find a middle ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I can go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit based on my budget.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, though I'd prefer to work with you if possible.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect your budget limitations. Let's make this work. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $890,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair deal considering the product's value. ",890000.0,Alice,5,
