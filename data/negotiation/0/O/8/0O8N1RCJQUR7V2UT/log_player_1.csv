This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It also adds a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can potentially do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great price for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little high on $9,000 though. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is close enough to my minimum of $8,000 and allows me to make a decent profit. Accepting his offer will finalize the sale quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds."
