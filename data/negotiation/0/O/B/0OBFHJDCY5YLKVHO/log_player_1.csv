"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. This seems like a fair reflection of its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you hope to get. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe strongly in the product's value. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to his perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product without revealing too much about its worth to us (Alice)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is attempting to anchor the negotiation at a price close to our minimum. While $1,075,000 is a profit, we have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000.  We are still in the early rounds, so it's worth countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value goes beyond simply splitting the difference. Its unique features and potential warrant a price closer to your own valuation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (But Flexible):**  We're signaling that we're not going to simply meet in the middle. By reducing our price by $30,000, we show flexibility but maintain a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value to Bob:** We're reiterating that the product's value should be considered from *his* perspective, reminding him of his $1,200,000 valuation. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The tone remains collaborative, emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial deal"" to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the current offer. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a significant profit above our minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price at the midpoint.  While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are less certain and risk a breakdown in the negotiation.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or walking away. We secure a good profit without dragging out the negotiation."
