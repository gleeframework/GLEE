"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low.  It's less than my minimum value and leaves me with no room for profit. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is still above my minimum value and reflects that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm not willing to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a satisfactory profit. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target. John's offer is a good fallback option if I can't close a deal with Bob at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer slightly to $16,000.  This shows flexibility while still being above my minimum value. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be more aggressive in finding a deal with Bob, but also ensure I don't lose too much potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite enough to make it worthwhile.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before settling for the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm reducing my counteroffer again to $15,500. This is a significant compromise, but it's still slightly above my minimum value, and with only 3 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take a smaller profit to avoid losing the deal completely. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum value, so I'm not losing money. However, I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for the same price.  Given the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and the chance he might increase his offer if I reject, I'm going to accept his offer.  It's a secure outcome that guarantees me my minimum value."
