"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $8,500 starts the negotiation at a point significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer again is the best course of action. Bob can try to further lower the price and potentially get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum budget and Alice's latest offer. $9,500 is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise, while still being lower than Alice's current price. This counteroffer could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's previous offers and getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his target.  Bob has shown he is willing to negotiate and has room to make another counteroffer. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit but wants to see if he can get a little closer to his target price without going over. $9,800 is a small increase from his previous offer and is a good compromise, showing Alice that he is serious about purchasing the product. This counteroffer could potentially lead to a successful negotiation and a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has shown a stubborn streak, and Bob has already offered a price very close to his maximum budget.  Alice's latest offer is only $2,000 below her original price, suggesting she might not be willing to negotiate further. It's now time for Bob to cut his losses.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees a price within his budget and avoids further potential negotiation dead-ends."
