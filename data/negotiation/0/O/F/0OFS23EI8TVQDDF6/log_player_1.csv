Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Aim High:**  I started with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he flat out rejects it, we know he's price sensitive. If he counteroffers, we can better understand his budget. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a number. I can't quite go that low, but how about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Split the Difference:** This approach aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a concession while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Maintain Value:**  By not dropping too drastically, you signal that the product is worth more than his initial offer. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This leaves some space for further negotiation if Bob isn't immediately convinced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly not budging much further, and $140 is a reasonable profit above your minimum. It's better to take this offer than risk him walking away or getting stuck in endless haggling."
