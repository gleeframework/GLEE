"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price.  You're willing to pay $150, so rejecting this offer might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer."
