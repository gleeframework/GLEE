"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth a lot more to the right person. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a fair price for the value of this product, and I think we can close a deal here.",135.0,Alice,3,
