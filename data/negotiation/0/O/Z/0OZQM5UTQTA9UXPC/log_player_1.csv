Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a relatively high price, aiming to maximize my profit.  However, it's still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  The fallback option with John ensures I won't be stuck with a deal that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 from John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my target price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum desired price of $8,000 and is closer to my target price than John's offer. It's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation might be limited.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
