"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my maximum, I can still potentially save some money by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice is willing to go slightly lower to finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 999,000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $500 less than Alice's initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating but am also willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to consider my offer and move closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is only $200 more than my last counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are very small and the risk of losing the deal is higher. It's in my best interest to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than buying from John."
