"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. It's still significantly less than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still being beneficial for me.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe we can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility while still aiming for a high profit. I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned we might not reach a better deal if I continue to counteroffer. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit that's only slightly lower than selling to John, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
