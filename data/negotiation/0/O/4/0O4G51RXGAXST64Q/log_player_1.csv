"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its quality and features, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher in future rounds. Accepting his offer risks settling for a price potentially lower than what I could achieve with further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees the $15,000 and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
