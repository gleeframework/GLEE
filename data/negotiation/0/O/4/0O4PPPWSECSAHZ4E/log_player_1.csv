Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600, which is a fair compromise. This price is still within my budget and allows us both to make a good deal.
