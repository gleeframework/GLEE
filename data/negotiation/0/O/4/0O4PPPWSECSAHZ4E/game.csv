"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600, which is a fair compromise. This price is still within my budget and allows us both to make a good deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
