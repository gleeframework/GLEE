"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $8,800 is still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,800 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,600, which is a fair compromise. This price is still within my budget and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $8,700 is still below Bob's maximum price of $10,000, meaning Bob will still save money by purchasing from Alice.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might not come down further, especially as she's already indicated her minimum price.
* **Time:**  With limited rounds, accepting the offer ensures a purchase without risking a breakdown in negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
