Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. He's consistently been below the $1,200,000 mark, and accepting his current offer would mean settling for a lower profit. John's guaranteed offer ensures you achieve your minimum acceptable price."
