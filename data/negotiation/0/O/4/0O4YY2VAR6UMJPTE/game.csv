"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet at $12,500? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to accept $12,000, which is my minimum price, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize the deal at $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,7,
