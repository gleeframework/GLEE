"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product is interesting, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,5,
