It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully makes Alice consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:

Alice's offer of $140 is within my budget and significantly better than John's price. I'm happy to accept this offer and move on."
