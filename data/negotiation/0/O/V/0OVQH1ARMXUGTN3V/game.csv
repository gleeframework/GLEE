"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,600,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,400,000? This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,450,000?  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $1,350,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
