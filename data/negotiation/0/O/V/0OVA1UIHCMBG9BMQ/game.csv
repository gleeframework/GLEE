"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $1,600,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. How about $1,550,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
