Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""public listing"" and ""demand"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $12,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a bit more depending on the product's importance to him.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place will help you reach an optimal outcome."
