{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

This offer sets a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point as it leaves space for both of us to be happy with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
