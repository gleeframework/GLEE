Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to me, hoping to encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a more favorable price than accepting his offer or selling to John at my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this work.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's closer to the value, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's not ideal, but I'm willing to accept it to secure a sale rather than risking further negotiation with Bob or selling to John at a lower price."
