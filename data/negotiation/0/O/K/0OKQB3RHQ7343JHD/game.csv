"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  How about we start around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you halfway at $9,500, which is still a great deal for you. This is my best counteroffer for now.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could make a deal at $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my minimum price. I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8000.0,Alice,7,
