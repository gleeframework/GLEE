,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. However, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. This offer reflects my serious interest while considering market value and my budget constraints.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500,000 is a bit too low for my expectations. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our interests.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, $650,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. My new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and reflects my flexibility in the negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, however, I feel our price expectations are still quite far apart.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $700,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
