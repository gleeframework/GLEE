Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a higher price than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider your offer seriously.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $20,000 leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can come down a bit. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:**  You can counter with a price closer to your desired range.
* **John is a backup:**  You have John as a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,000?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price than Bob's offer:**  This keeps the negotiations moving closer to your desired range.
* **Be reasonable:** $17,000 is a significant compromise from your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  Remind Bob of the product's quality to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but still below your minimum:**  $14,000 is only $1,000 away from your minimum, but it's still below your desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  With one more counteroffer, you might be able to get closer to your target price of $15,000 or even higher.
* **John is a backup:** You have John as a backup if negotiations fail, so you can take a chance on getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $14,500 is still above your minimum of $15,000. 
* **Positive language:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" emphasizes a win-win scenario and encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** $13,500 is below your absolute minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiations are stalled:**  Bob has consistently offered lower prices, and it seems unlikely that he will go higher.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you your minimum price, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
