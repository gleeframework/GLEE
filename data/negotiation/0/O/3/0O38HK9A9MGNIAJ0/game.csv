"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $850,000. This is my final counteroffer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
