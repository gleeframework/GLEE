"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $15000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to save, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I can still make a decent return on my investment.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,6,
