"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1800000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $1300000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1300000 is unfortunately too far off from what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
