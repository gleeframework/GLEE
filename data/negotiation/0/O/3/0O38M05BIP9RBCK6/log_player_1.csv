"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1800000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $1300000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too far off from what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
