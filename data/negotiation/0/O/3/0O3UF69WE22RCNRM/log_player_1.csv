""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and allows for some downward negotiation if he counters.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we want the best price, starting too high (e.g., $1,199,999) might make Bob feel like we're not negotiating in good faith and could lead to him walking away. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,100,000 or a bit lower still represents a significant profit margin over our backup offer from John ($800,000)."
