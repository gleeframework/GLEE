Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm prepared to come down a bit further,  but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be open to $1,425,000?  Let's bridge the gap and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your new offer. I would like to propose $1400000 as a potential compromise, which still allows us to maintain a reasonable price for me while reflecting the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a good time to close the deal and secure a significant profit.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in the future."
