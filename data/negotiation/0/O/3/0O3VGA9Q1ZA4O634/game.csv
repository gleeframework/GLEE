"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1400000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1350000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm prepared to come down a bit further,  but I need to stay above $1400000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be open to $1425000?  Let's bridge the gap and see if we can close this deal.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your new offer. I would like to propose $1400000 as a potential compromise, which still allows us to maintain a reasonable price for me while reflecting the value you place on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
