Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so $14,000 is a good price for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can lower the price a little if Bob counters, but still make a decent profit.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if you don't get a better offer from Bob."
