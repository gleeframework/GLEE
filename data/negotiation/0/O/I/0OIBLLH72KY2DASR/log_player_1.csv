Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a guaranteed $25,000 profit.  It's more strategic to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
