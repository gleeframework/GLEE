{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and I should try to get a better price.  I'll start by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need a lower price to consider it. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and see if she's willing to come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, which would be $13000. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. As a final offer, I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects a compromise from both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still higher than my target of $10,000. I've made multiple counteroffers and shown my willingness to negotiate, but she's not willing to come down further.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $10,000.  It's a guaranteed deal at my desired price, and it avoids further negotiation."
