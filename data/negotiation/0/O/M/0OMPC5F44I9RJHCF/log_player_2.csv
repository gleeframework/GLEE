"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good deal for her, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to you, while also being a fair price for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I think this is the minimum price I can accept to ensure I make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,175,000? This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product holds for you, while also being a fair price for me.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point, it's only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and may not result in a significant price drop.  Considering John's price of $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money and acquire the product."
