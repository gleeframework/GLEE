"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a fair price considering it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
