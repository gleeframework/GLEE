Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Bob to Negotiate:**  While I want the highest price, giving Bob room to counter-offer might lead to a price higher than $100. 
* **Consider the ""Walk-Away"" Price:**  I know I can sell it to John for $100, so anything above that is a gain for me.  

By starting at $150, I give myself the best chance to maximize my profit while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept it outright."
