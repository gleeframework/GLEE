Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I'm aiming higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $1,000,000 offer isn't outrageous but leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially mutually beneficial agreement above my minimum.
* **Gauging interest:** The message is framed to encourage a response from Bob, allowing me to understand his level of interest and adjust my approach accordingly."
