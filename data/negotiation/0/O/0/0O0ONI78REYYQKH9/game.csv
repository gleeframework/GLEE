"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects the potential of the product while still leaving room for a fair profit for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product, especially given your plans for it, makes $950,000 significantly undervalue its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my initial goal, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  It seems we're getting closer. To find a middle ground quickly, I'd be willing to accept $1,000,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours. I believe it reflects the true value of the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
