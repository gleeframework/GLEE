"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better. He has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $875,000 is a good price for him, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While he might be able to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
