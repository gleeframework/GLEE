{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I'm still willing to try and get a better deal.  I'll see if I can push Bob up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking to get closer to $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
