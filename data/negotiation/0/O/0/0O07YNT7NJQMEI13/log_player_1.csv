"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $75 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's right at my minimum, it's still a sale and avoids the risk of him rejecting any further counteroffers.  It's also a better outcome than selling to John for the same price."
