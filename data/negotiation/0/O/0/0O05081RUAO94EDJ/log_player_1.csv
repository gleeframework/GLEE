Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $80, it's still lower than your initial offer. There's potential to get closer to your desired price of $95. Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. Let's meet in the middle, how about that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
