Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for you. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate, so the offer to Bob should reflect confidence in the product's value."
