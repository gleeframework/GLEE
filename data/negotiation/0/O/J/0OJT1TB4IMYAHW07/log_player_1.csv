Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you're interested in. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what you're gaining. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you're not losing anything by starting with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.  

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob**, who values the product equally to you.
2. **Maintain a fallback option with John** if Bob finds the initial price unreasonable."
