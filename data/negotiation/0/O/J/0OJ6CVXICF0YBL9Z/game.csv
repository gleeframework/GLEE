"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price that I think you'll be happy with.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $102.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy with the deal.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $105. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,7,
