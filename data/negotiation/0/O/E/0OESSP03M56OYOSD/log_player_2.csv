Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal."
