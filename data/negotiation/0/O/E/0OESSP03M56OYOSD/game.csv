"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to my budget. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
