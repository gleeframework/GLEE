"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1100000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's worth to me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to meet my minimum requirement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product, which is a significant amount for me. It represents a fair balance between our needs. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000. My revised offer is $925000. This is a reasonable price that should meet both our needs. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925000 is still stretching my budget. I'm offering $900000 one last time. This price reflects the value of the product to me while remaining within my financial limits. Let's close this deal, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit anxious to close this deal. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,7,
