"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed your expectations. This exceptional item holds a significant value to me, but considering its worth to you, I believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $10,000. I understand that it's a substantial investment, but I assure you, it's an excellent value given its quality and utility. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, $10,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum budget and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John.  You can reject the offer hoping Alice will come down in price, or proceed with buying from John at your target price point."
