"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",102.0,Alice,5,
