,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we both get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $105. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we settle on $102?  It's just a little bit above your last offer, but still a good price for both of us.  What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $98? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
