"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which is what I'd pay from another seller.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to pay more than his perceived value of $120. Since I have another buyer (John) lined up at that price, there's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob. It's better to secure the sale now with John."
