"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $6,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $6,800? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",6800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $6,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.
