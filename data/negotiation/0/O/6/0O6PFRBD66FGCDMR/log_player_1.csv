Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $11,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Openness:** The message leaves space for Bob to counter, which is crucial for a successful negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
