"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a little extra since the product is worth $12,000 to him.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a smaller decrease than Bob's offer, showing him I'm serious about getting a good price but also willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. With 6 rounds left, there's still time for us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,900}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,900. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, signaling to Bob that I'm getting closer to accepting a price around his last offer. With five rounds left, I hope this shows I'm committed to closing the deal while also ensuring a fair price for me."
