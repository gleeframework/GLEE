{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. However, he is still keeping the price lower than Alice's latest offer, showing that he is serious about negotiating a better deal. This moderate increase in price signals a potential willingness to come to an agreement while also ensuring Bob is still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is the lowest she has offered so far.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product."
