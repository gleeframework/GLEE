"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
