,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $9,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
