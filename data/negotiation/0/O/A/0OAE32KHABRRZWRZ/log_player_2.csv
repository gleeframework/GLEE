"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go higher before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to invest a bit more conservatively.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Testing the Waters:**  It's a lower offer than Bob might be willing to pay, allowing him to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to meet him halfway.
* **Building a Foundation:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product, creating a basis for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about investing conservatively, but I believe the product's potential is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's counteroffer is a significant jump from her previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable Price:** $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget and represents a substantial saving.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of missing out on the product and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
