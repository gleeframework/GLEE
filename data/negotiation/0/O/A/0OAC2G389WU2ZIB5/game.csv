"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and is a price I feel comfortable with.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
