# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

You can do better than $120.  Let's try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

$110 is a good price for the product, considering it's worth $150 from John.  Let's take it."
