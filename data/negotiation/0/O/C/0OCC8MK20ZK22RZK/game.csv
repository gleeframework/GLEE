"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This gives us both a fair price, and keeps the deal moving forward.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this work for both of us, how about $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value well worth it.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,275,000. I really think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,275,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  To bridge the gap and get this deal done, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This would make it a win-win for both of us, and we can finally finalize this sale.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up from my previous offer, but I think $1,280,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",1280000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're running out of time. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,280,000 simply isn't enough for me. This product is worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  Let's settle this at $1,290,000. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1290000.0,Alice,9,
