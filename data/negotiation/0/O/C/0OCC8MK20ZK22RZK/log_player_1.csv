"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,450,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of securing a good price within the 10 rounds, while keeping the option of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it demonstrates his interest. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm confident I can get closer to that price through further negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price, without losing out on the opportunity to sell to John if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This gives us both a fair price, and keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer but demonstrating flexibility by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Midpoint Offer:**  My counteroffer is the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I emphasize the benefit to both parties of reaching a fair price, making it more likely Bob will consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still securing a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this work for both of us, how about $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value well worth it."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,275,000. I really think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,275,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  To bridge the gap and get this deal done, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up from my previous offer, but I think $1,280,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?

* **Potential for a better offer:**  Although we're getting closer, I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to secure a higher price. If Bob doesn't meet my minimum price, I can always sell to John as a last resort."
