"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
