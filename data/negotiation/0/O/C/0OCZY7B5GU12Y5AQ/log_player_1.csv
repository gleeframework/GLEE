I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price higher than what it's worth to him, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can reach a compromise with Bob, as he's still getting a good deal compared to what he'd be willing to pay elsewhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not comfortable with my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counter with a higher price, but still below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to get a better deal than his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of John's offer, which is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
