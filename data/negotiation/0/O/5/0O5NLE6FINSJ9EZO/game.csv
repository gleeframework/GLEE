"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1300000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not convinced that $1150000 is enough. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1225000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our negotiations so far.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $1300000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1230000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I think I've been more than fair in our negotiations so far. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $1350000. This is as close to my target price as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm still not willing to pay $1350000. I'm afraid I've reached my limit and will have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000 if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $1240000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1240000.0,Bob,10,
