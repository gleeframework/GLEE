"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and what John is offering ($10,000).  It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you find acceptable in a single counteroffer. It's in your best interest to start negotiations lower and work your way up strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer (and your actual budget), you leave room for negotiation. This tactic might encourage Alice to propose a more reasonable counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer signals that you're serious about buying but are looking for a fair price.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you always have the option to buy from John for $10,000, so don't feel pressured to settle for anything above that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you can still try to negotiate a better deal. She's dropped $3,000, showing a willingness to compromise. You can likely get her closer to $10,000, especially since you have John's offer as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer ($8,000) and her current offer ($11,000). It's a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Approaching Your Limit:** You're getting closer to your $10,000 limit with John, so it's crucial to nudge Alice closer while still leaving yourself some negotiating room. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By making a counteroffer, you're showing Alice you're serious about the purchase but aren't willing to accept just any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $10,500, and I think that's still a great deal for you. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle of our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500.  You've successfully negotiated her down, but it's now more beneficial to take John's offer of $10,000. You'll save $500 and avoid the risk of Alice sticking to her price."
