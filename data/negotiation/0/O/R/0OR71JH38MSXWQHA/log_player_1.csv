Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This represents a significant discount compared to the value it can bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:** Emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob's business justifies the high price.
* **Set a Deadline (Implied):** The fact that John is waiting in the wings creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,000,000?**

While ideal, it's highly likely Bob would reject such an offer outright. Leaving no room for negotiation makes it harder to reach a deal. This strategy aims for a win-win where both parties feel satisfied."
