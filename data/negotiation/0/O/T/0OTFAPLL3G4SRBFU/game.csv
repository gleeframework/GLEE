"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This is a very fair price considering your last offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. ",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to hold out for a slightly better price.",9800.0,Alice,7,
