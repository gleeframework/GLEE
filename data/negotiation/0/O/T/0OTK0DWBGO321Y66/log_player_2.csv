"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much I can get the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for me if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but I believe there's still room to go lower. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to the middle ground between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that's a good deal for me and potentially acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $75, but I think I can do a bit better. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. This is still a great deal, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while I could try to negotiate further, $85 is a reasonable price. It's a good balance between getting a deal and avoiding the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
