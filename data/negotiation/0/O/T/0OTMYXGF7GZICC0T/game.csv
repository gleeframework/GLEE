"I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm considering other options. However, I'm still willing to make one last effort to find a mutually beneficial price. My final offer is $12000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'm adding a 1-year warranty and a premium support package. This is my last offer.",12000.0,Alice,9,
