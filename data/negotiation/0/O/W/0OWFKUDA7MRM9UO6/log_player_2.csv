"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal interests. I am offering you the chance to own this masterpiece at a special price. My proposal is to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects my desire to ensure you receive exceptional value while also allowing me to maximize the return on this significant investment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to the possibility of facilitating this transaction with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($1,000,000). While her offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation. 

You have the safety net of buying from John at $1,500,000, but there's a good chance you can secure a better price from Alice with a counter-offer."
