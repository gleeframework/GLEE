"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,200,000 is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's counteroffer and my minimum. I hope to meet him in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is still too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm also trying to gauge Bob's true value for the product. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. We're getting close to the end, so I need to be careful not to run out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.  I believe Bob sees the value in this product, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer.  We're getting very close to my backup option of selling to John, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting to the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids the risk of running out of time."
