"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Considering the product's worth to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This offer takes into account both the value you place on the product and my objective to maximize the return on this valuable asset. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a satisfactory arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is negotiable, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. This is significantly less than Alice's starting offer of $12,000.  There's no point in negotiating with Alice when you can save $4,000 by going directly to John."
