"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages a positive response from Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefits of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would still give you a good profit and allows me to get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,050,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 8 more rounds to work with. I can counter with a slightly lower offer, keeping the deal alive and potentially finding a price that benefits both of us. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and keeps the deal attractive for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower but acceptable price:** I'm decreasing my price but still remaining above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating that the proposed price is fair and advantageous to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation room:**  I have 6 rounds left. I can continue to counter and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John's offer remains:** If things don't work out with Bob, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 waiting with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and make the deal more appealing.
* **Maintaining urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that we have limited time and suggesting that this might be the best possible offer he'll get."
