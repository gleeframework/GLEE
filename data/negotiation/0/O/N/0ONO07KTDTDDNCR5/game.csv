"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and it's a good compromise.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $88? It's a good compromise and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $90, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
