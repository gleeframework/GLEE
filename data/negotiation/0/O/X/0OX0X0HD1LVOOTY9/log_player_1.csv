{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still below John's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still leaving me some margin to make a profit. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I want to make a deal, $120 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Rejecting gives me the chance to counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price point. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more firm in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $145 is still above my minimum price of $150, ensuring that I don't sell at a loss.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encouraging Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **Another counteroffer:**  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a secure option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $140, and I really think this product will be worth it for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible while still being reasonable.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm only lowering the price by $5, showing that I'm willing to be flexible, but not giving up too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using a friendly tone and leaving the door open for further discussion."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further compromise:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, even with the possibility of future negotiations.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.  It's a more secure option and guarantees I'll meet my financial goal. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort. Selling to John allows me to move on quickly and avoid further potential delays or complications."
