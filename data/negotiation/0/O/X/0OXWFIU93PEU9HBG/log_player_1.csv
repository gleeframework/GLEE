Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately triggering Bob's rejection.
* **Potential for Gain:**  If Bob accepts, I get a good price. If he doesn't, it opens the door for him to counteroffer, and we can see if we can meet in the middle.

**Remember:** This is just the first step. Depending on how Bob responds, I'll need to adjust my strategy going forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** While I could sell to Bob at $85, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:** I know I can sell to John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to counteroffer Bob with a price between $85 and my minimum of $100. I'll try to find a price point that's attractive to Bob but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his initial counteroffer.
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $90 still allows me to earn a decent profit, considering my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a quick agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider accepting his initial offer of $85 to avoid further negotiation.  However, I still have John as a backup, so I'm not in a desperate situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $87.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, making it a decent deal. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly better offer. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but further rejection might lead him to walk away altogether.

**Strategy:**

This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the sale.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $100, it's not worth risking losing Bob for a small difference in price."
