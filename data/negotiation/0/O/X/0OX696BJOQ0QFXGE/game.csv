"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $750,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's true worth, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer and reflects the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the immense value you'll be receiving.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
