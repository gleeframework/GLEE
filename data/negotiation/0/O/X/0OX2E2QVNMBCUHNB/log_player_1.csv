{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's a starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  By setting a higher initial price, you can potentially maximize your profit, but you also risk losing the sale if Bob finds it too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $90. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I can come down to $95.  It's a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
