,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering my minimum price.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
