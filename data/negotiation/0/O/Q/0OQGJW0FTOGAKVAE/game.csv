"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a profit while being fair to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. It's a win-win situation. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
