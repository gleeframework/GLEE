**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and her valuation of $800,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price. There's a chance she might come back with a lower offer closer to her actual valuation.
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you have John as a backup option. While buying from John isn't ideal, it ensures you don't overpay significantly."
