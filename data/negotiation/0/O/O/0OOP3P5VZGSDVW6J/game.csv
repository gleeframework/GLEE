"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $1,110,000? This is a fair compromise that keeps us both in a good position.  What do you think?",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm going to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,115,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
