"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's first offer is quite high, considering her valuation is $800,000. There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and close the deal closer to her valuation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice is coming down, but claiming it's her final offer so early seems like a negotiating tactic. I'll call her bluff and counteroffer a bit higher than my previous offer to see if she's serious."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest,  anything under $1,000,000 just wouldn't be fair to the value of this product. If you're able to meet me at that price, the deal is yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has come down significantly, and while it's possible to negotiate a little further, $1,000,000 is a reasonable price. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal."
