Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Testing the Waters:** While $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's impossible to know if he might be willing to pay more than $8,000 without testing the waters. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so there's limited risk in starting with a high asking price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but also be mindful of potentially souring a deal by being overly aggressive."
