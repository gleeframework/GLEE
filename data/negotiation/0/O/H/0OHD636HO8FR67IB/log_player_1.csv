"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am currently working with a budget of $950,000. Would you consider lowering the price to accommodate my financial situation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay that amount, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the maximum value he's willing to pay. While it's still less than my ideal price of $1,200,000, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more rejections and further delay.  It's better to accept his offer and secure a deal."
