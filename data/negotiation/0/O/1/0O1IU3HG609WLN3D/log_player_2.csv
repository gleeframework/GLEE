"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$5,000 is a very good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. We want to see if we can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $3,000 is a substantial discount from her initial price, but still within our budget. We want to see how far she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, we still have room to negotiate. We want to see if we can get closer to our desired price point.  Rejecting this offer keeps us in the negotiation and allows for further exploration of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly to $3,500.  This shows Alice we're serious about buying the product but are still pushing for a lower price. We're hoping this small increase is enough to convince her to accept the deal, as we are already at a significant discount from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,500 is a good deal, we can still try to push for a lower price. We've already established a range between $3,500 and $4,500. By rejecting this offer, we can make a final counteroffer to see if we can close the deal at a price that's more favorable to us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final attempt to get a lower price.  We're offering $4,000, which is a compromise between our last offer and Alice's latest offer. We're hoping this shows our willingness to negotiate and will be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal. If she rejects, we'll have to consider buying from John as we've used up most of our negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we haven't reached our ideal price point, $4,750 is a fair compromise. We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice's offers are getting closer to our counteroffers. It's likely she's not willing to go lower. We only have a few rounds remaining before we'd have to buy from John, so accepting the offer now is the best course of action."
