"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value I've attached to this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $8000 to make it worth my while. How about we discuss a price of $12000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, I still feel that $12000 might be a bit out of my range. Would it be possible to lower the price to $10000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to propose a slight twist. I'll throw in an additional service or warranty that's worth $1000, which would bring the total value to $11000. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still within your budget, and I'll get the minimum value I'm looking for. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
