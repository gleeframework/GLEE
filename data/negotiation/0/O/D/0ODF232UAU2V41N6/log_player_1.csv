Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, highlighting the ""value and potential"" might pique his interest and make him consider the offer more seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, which could lead to Bob making a counter-offer and potentially reaching a price higher than $15,000. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, with a strong backup option, you're not losing anything by aiming high initially."
