"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $7,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair offer considering we both benefit from a deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,
