"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value I'm placing on the product, while still being a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice's new offer is still too high, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer that's lower than Alice's new offer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway, but still keep the price low.

{""message"": ""I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. Can you consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
