"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value I'm placing on the product, while still being a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
