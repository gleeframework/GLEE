,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're genuinely interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $9000 feels more fair given the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see that you're eager to own this product.  $8200 is still a bit low for me, but to be fair, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $8600.  That way, we both get something out of this deal. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8100?",8100.0,Bob,6,
