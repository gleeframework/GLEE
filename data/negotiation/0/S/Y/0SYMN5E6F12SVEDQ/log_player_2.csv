"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.

* **Jhon's price:** $1,000,000

While $900,000 is a better deal than Jhon's price, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
