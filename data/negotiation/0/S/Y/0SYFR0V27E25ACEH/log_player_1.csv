Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding middle ground is certainly important to me.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher number. How about we settle at $1,200,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it seems unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
