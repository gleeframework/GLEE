Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm starting with an offer slightly above the product's worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. I'm also keeping in mind that Bob values the product at the same amount, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than my minimum.  John offers a fair price, and I will sell to him."
