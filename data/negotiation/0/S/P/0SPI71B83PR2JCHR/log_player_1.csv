"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows for room to negotiate downwards.  $2,000,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it's still within the realm of possibility given the product's value to me.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the deal's value to Bob and creates a sense of urgency to close. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for negotiation.

**Important Note:**  While the goal is to maximize profit, it's crucial to balance that with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob consistently rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.**  Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **There are still rounds left.**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob first.**  John's offer is my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I will need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we settle on $1,700,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's but still lower than my ideal price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my leverage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, emphasizing its worth to Bob to justify the price.
* **Framing as a win-win:**  I frame the offer as a good deal for both of us, creating a sense of fairness and encouraging agreement.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to reassess my strategy. I'll be more willing to consider selling to John if further negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price. However, I'll still be open to making further compromises to close the deal, especially if Bob demonstrates a strong desire to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.** While it's closer than before, accepting it would still result in a loss. 
* **We're nearing the middle ground.** The negotiations are getting closer to a potential agreement, and there's still a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob first.** I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob, and John's offer remains my safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I will consider how much I am willing to compromise to reach a deal, but I won't be willing to go below $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to work towards a deal and signals that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message suggests a sense of finality, hinting that I'm reaching my limit on compromises. This might encourage Bob to reconsider his position.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts, great!**  The deal is closed, and I've secured a decent price.
* **If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options.**  I'll be closer to John's offer, but I'll still consider a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible.  However, I won't go lower, as I have a guaranteed sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.**  Accepting it would result in a loss, even though it's only slightly below my minimum.
* **We're getting closer, but I want to try for a better deal.**  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a strong backup.**  While I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible. I will need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise, knowing that John's offer is a solid alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'll accept $1,500,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I can't go lower. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll be forced to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm putting my foot down at my minimum acceptable value. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also reaching my limit on compromises.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies that I'm ready to walk away if Bob doesn't accept. This pressure could encourage him to make a decision.
* **Providing an Alternative:**  I mention exploring other options, subtly reminding Bob of John's offer, reinforcing my position.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts, fantastic!** I've successfully closed the deal at my minimum acceptable value.
* **If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John.**  I've reached my limit, and John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is stubbornly below my minimum.**  He's not budging, and accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **We're down to the wire.** There are only two rounds left, and there's little chance of Bob changing his mind. 
* **John's offer guarantees my desired value.**  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a secure sale with John.

**I'm choosing to sell to John. It's the best decision for my financial interests.**  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I've maximized my potential profit and secured a good outcome."
