"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000?
