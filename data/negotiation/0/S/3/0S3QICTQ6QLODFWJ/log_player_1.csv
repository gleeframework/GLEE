Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm reducing the price to $1,350,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a reasonable margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  It's not a huge gain, but it's worth it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out altogether."
