"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $90 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to anchor the price lower. While it's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it leaves room for negotiation while staying below my $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and agree on $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We know $80 is her ideal price, so let's propose that directly and see how she responds. It's a fair offer, and it saves me a significant amount compared to her starting price or buying from John."
