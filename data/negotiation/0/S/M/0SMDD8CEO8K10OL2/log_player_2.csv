"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  This offer also shows that you are serious about buying the product but are looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $110? This would be a great deal for you, and still leaves me some profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $108? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my previous offer. It shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still have a firm budget. By offering $108, I'm giving her a bit more profit than my initial offer, while staying within my budget. This approach could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $109? This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $109 is close to my budget, I'm not comfortable going over it. I've already made a few counteroffers, and Alice seems unwilling to budge much further.  John's offer of $100 is a guaranteed deal within my budget, making it the most sensible option at this point."
