"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, how about $110? This would be a great deal for you, and still leaves me some profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $108? This would be a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $109? This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get what we want.",109.0,Alice,5,
