Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets a high starting point, aiming to maximize profit.  It's important to note that this is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on my assessment of his willingness to pay. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."

Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, but still represents a significant profit. However, I believe there is room for improvement in the price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's important to keep John's offer in mind, but I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal with Bob that's more advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm still confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price, and I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction, but it still allows me to make a good profit. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, and I hope this shows my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round. However, if he rejects again, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 to avoid losing more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing.  John's offer is a secure way to ensure I get at least $1,000,000."
