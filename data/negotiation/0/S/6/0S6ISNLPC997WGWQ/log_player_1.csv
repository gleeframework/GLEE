"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to come down a bit, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not going to accept that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is still a decent profit for me, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to settle for less than $8,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come up to my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $8,500. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again. I'm getting a little nervous, as we're running out of rounds, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to $8,200.  This is a significant compromise on my part. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're getting close to a deal and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had enough. Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and we're running out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than accepting a price that's too low."
