"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to make sure this deal is fair for me as well. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a reasonable compromise that keeps this negotiation moving forward.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
