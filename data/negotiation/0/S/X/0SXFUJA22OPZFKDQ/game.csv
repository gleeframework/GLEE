"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which still leaves a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
