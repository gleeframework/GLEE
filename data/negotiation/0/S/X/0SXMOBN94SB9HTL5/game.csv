"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me and considering your own profit margin, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This adjustment still ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that a price of $1,100,000 would be a win-win for both of us. This price allows you a substantial profit while remaining within my financial limits. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
