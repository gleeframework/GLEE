Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me and considering your own profit margin, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial starting point for negotiations.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that a price of $1,100,000 would be a win-win for both of us. This price allows you a substantial profit while remaining within my financial limits. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
