"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $875000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",875000.0,Alice,5,
