"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. The product we're discussing is truly unique and holds immense value, far beyond its tangible aspects. Given its significance, I believe it's worth more than just monetary exchange. However, understanding that value is subjective, I propose a special deal. For you, the price would be $9,500. This offer includes not only the product itself but also a personalized experience tailored to enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of it. I hope you find this proposal attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  While she uses persuasive language, the extra features don't justify the price difference for you. Buying from John saves you the most money."
