"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product given its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below what I would ideally like, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we're already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
