"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $100. While this is a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the feedback, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 95. It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is closer to your desired price point.  However, you are still willing to pay less. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to try for an even lower price. You are willing to pay up to $120 and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there is still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $92?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 92}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at 93. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $93:** This is a reasonable price, considering your maximum price is $120 and Alice's minimum is likely $80. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** You've already made several counteroffers, and Alice has also made concessions.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a situation where Alice becomes unwilling to sell. 
* **Opportunity cost:** If you reject this offer and continue, you risk losing out on the deal entirely. You could then be forced to buy from John for $120, which is significantly higher than the current offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer of $93 is the most logical decision, as it achieves your goal of purchasing the product while saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
