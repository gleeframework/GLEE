Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you a slight discount to $98. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible.  While $98 is getting closer to his limit, he's still determined to try and get a lower price.  He can still counter-offer and try to reach a deal closer to his $80 limit, and he has time remaining to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $98 is still a bit too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $93.  I think this price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $93. I can offer you a slight discount to $96. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Time:** He's already in round 7, and the time is running out.  He only has 3 rounds left.
* **Price:** While $96 is the lowest Alice has offered so far, it's still above Bob's $80 limit.
* **Alternative:**  John is offering the product at Bob's exact target price of $80.

Considering these factors, Bob's best option is to buy the product from John. He can secure the product for his target price and avoid further negotiation with Alice, who may not be willing to go any lower."
