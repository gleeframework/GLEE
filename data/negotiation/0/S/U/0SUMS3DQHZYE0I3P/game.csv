"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a compromise at $100. It's a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $100 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $95.  I think this is a fair price where we can both be happy with the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I can offer you a slight discount to $98. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $98 is still a bit too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $93.  I think this price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.",93.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $93. I can offer you a slight discount to $96. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",96.0,Alice,7,
