Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you understand how eager Bob is to buy the product. If he outright rejects it, you can always adjust your approach."
