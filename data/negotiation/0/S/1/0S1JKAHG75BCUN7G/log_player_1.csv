**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. He's consistently been aiming for a price below $1,250,000. Accepting his current offer would mean losing a significant portion of the product's value compared to selling it to John. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to risk Bob not coming up to an acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
