Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $750000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to pay $650000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $675000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $680000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
