"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
