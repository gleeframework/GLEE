Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob is key.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  He values it at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time"" and ""other options"" phrases add pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you imply understanding its value ""to someone like you"" (perhaps implying his specific needs). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. This offer leaves some room for him to counter-offer and still land within a profitable range for you.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, a slightly less aggressive approach might be wiser."
