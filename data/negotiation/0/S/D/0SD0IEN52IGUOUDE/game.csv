"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $600,000 and go from there?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
