Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $600,000 and go from there?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
