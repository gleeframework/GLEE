Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it offers excellent value, especially considering it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential haggling, but still ensures a significant profit if accepted.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I don't need to drastically lower the price for Bob.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a high price from Bob and avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer entirely."
