"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. It's important to counter with a much lower price to signal that I'm looking for a significantly better deal.  I'm far from desperate enough to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive starting point:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $80 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that her initial offer was unrealistic for my budget.
* **Polite but firm:**  The message expresses interest but firmly establishes my price range.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of a price of $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $90 is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of overpaying. I need to signal that I'm serious about a lower price point.  I'm still not ready to go to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit beyond my price range. I could possibly do $75.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm staying firm below my $80 limit.
* **Direct and clear:** The message clearly states my price limit and leaves the ball in Alice's court.
* **Testing for flexibility:** This offer will further gauge how much Alice is willing to compromise to make the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm thinking of a price of $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $85 is still $5 more than I need to spend. At this point, I need to show Alice I'm willing to walk away and take the deal with John if necessary.  The next round will be crucial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I have a strict budget. I can do $80, which is a fair price.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with another seller."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my maximum price and a clear line in the sand. 
* **Alternative presented:**  By mentioning John, I'm showing Alice I have another option and am not afraid to walk away.
* **Pressure point:**  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept a reasonable profit or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $80 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $82.50. While it's close to my $80 limit, I'm better off sticking to my budget and going with John. It's not worth overpaying even a small amount when I have a guaranteed alternative."
