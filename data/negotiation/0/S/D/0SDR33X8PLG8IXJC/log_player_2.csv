"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $6,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $4,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $6,000, leaving room for potential negotiation but still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. This counteroffer tests the waters and assesses Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially save money. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $4,500 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $4,000 and Alice's current offer of $5,500. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $5,200 is only $200 higher than Bob's last counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate may save a few hundred dollars, but the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price. Accepting the offer is the most logical decision at this point."
