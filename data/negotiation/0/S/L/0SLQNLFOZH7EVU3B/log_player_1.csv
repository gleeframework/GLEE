{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $6,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I will counter with a higher offer, aiming to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still holding my ground.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will spark a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer again, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm offering $7,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us. Hopefully, this will be the final price point and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'd be willing to do $7,250, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $7,250 is still below my minimum, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and getting closer to what I'm hoping for. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's becoming increasingly time-consuming and there's no guarantee of a better price. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on, securing a good profit."
