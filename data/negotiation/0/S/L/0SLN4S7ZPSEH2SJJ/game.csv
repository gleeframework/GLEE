"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so how about we go with $9,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9250.0,Bob,6,
