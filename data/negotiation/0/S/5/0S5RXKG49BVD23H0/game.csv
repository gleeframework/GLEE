"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. If not, I'll consider other offers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
