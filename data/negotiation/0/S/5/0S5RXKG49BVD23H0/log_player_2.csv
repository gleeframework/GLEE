Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a significant amount to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. If not, I'll consider other offers.

Alice has met you in the middle at her absolute lowest price.  It's unlikely she'll go lower and this is a good deal for you."
