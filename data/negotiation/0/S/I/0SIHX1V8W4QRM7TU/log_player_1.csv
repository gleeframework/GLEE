Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value and deal for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave room for counteroffers, recognizing that Bob might want to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging a swift agreement. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for your product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value proposition:** While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's counteroffer shows that he's willing to pay more than his initial $12,000 valuation. This suggests further negotiation could lead to a higher price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I want to explore if I can get closer to that value with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can potentially reach a more favorable price without losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it reflects the real value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value justification:** I reinforce the product's value to justify my counteroffer and emphasize the fairness of the price.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's make a deal!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept my offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, while still staying above my minimum profit margin."
