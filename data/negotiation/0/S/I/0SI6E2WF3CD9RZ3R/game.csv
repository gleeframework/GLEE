"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents a premium price for a unique product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept while still honoring the value of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
