Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down some, it's still more than my budget. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept while still honoring the value of what's being offered.

Alice's final offer is still too high for me.  Even though it's a significant drop from her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'll go with John's offer and save some money."
