Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,062,500. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000 was a bit too low, and $1,062,500 is still a bit too low. Let's aim for $1,090,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will become less willing to negotiate.  Accepting $1,090,000 secures a good deal."
