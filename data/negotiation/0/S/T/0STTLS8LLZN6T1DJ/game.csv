"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. It's a fair compromise considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
