"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows me to stay within my price range. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain from this product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still outside my comfortable price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which represents a significant move on my end. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $900,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider  $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're at your bottom line, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,
