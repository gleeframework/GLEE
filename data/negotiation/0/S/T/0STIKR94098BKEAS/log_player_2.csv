Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}

You've made a few counteroffers and it seems Alice is coming down a little. This counteroffer is getting closer to her minimum price."

Alice's offer is still too high. You only have three rounds left and there's a good chance you won't reach an agreement with Alice. It's better to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is still within your budget."
