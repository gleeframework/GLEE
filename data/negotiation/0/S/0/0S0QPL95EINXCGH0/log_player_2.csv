"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll find very valuable. I'm starting with an offer of $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than the product's value to Alice ($8,000). 
* There's room for negotiation. 
* It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. Let's try $11,000.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, and there's room for further negotiation. 
* It's worth trying to get a lower price, especially since there are 7 rounds left.
* Buying from John at $15,000 is still a much worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That seems fair and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $11,000 again.  I think we can both find a good deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has repeated her offer of $11,000, which is a fair price considering her bottom line and Bob's target price range.
* There are only 5 rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price.
* Buying from John at $15,000 is still a worse deal than accepting Alice's offer.
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product within his budget and secure a good deal."
