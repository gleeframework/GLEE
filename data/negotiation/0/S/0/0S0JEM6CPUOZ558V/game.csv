"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $800,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
