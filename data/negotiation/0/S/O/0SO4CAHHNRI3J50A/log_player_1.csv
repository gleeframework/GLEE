Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its quality. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($18,000 vs. $12,000) sets a strong anchor for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle. This makes Bob feel more in control and increases the chance of a sale.
* **Confident but not greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while avoiding seeming overly greedy.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This strong fallback position gives her leverage in the negotiation."
