"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am not able to pay $1,200,000 for it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This allows me to make a fair profit while still being within your budget. ",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. I hope this is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
