"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a price of $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,5,
