Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it for $10,000 is still a good deal for him, as he'll be getting it for $2,000 more than what he considers its worth.
* **Value to Alice:**  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than what Alice would get from John ($12,000). This maximizes Alice's potential profit while still having a good chance of Bob accepting the offer. 

**Note:** This assumes a few things:

* **Negotiation is possible:** There's no indication in the prompt that Alice cannot negotiate with Bob.
* **Bob's willingness to pay:**  This offer assumes Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value if he sees it as a good deal.

By offering a price in the middle ground, Alice balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
