Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of what I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $11,500, which would be $10,875. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:

While I could likely negotiate the price down a bit more, Alice is clearly committed to a price above $10,500. Accepting her offer at $10,875 is a reasonable compromise, saving me over $4,000 compared to John's offer."
