"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me than $10,000. Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is valuable to you, but I have a strict budget. My final offer is $10,250.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of what I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and $11,500, which would be $10,875. Let me know if that works for you.",10875.0,Alice,7,
