"I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal for you, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $150, which is a great deal for you and still a good profit for me.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $125. This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the price yet. I can offer you a price of $155, which is still a good deal for you and brings me closer to my desired price.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $155 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130, which is my final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not ready to accept $130 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $155, which would be $142.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more.",142.5,Alice,7,
