Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $150, which is a great deal for you and still a good profit for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the price yet.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $155 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130, which is my final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not ready to accept $130 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $155, which would be $142.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5

```

Alice's offer of $142.50 is still too high for me, and we are getting close to the end of our rounds.  It's not worth risking another rejection and counteroffer. I'll buy the product from John for $120."
