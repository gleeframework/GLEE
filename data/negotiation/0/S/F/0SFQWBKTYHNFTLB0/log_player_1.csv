"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a little more out of this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $9,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to offer the product for $9,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. How about $9200? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting close, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I have a few rounds left and don't want to settle for anything less than $9,500."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying, I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short. How about $9000? I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price, but I really like the product and I think it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and there's a chance Bob will walk away.  Selling to John guarantees me at least my minimum price, which is better than risking losing out on a deal altogether."
