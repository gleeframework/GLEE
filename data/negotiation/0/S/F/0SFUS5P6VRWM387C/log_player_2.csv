"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,500,000. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,500,000.  There's room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.  Alice might be bluffing about the other buyer to pressure you."
