"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum price. This way I'm opening a negotiation without immediately closing the door on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's getting close to the price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. While $132 is getting close to my minimum, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob, especially since we've got more rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $132 is still just a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $134. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $134. Would you be willing to meet me at $131? It's the last offer I'm willing to make, and I'd really like to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to the end, and while I'd prefer a higher price, I'm realizing that Bob might not be willing to go any higher.  $131 is only slightly below my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
