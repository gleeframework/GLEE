"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that reflects its incredible value. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make this deal happen. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial price point that ensures a successful transaction for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the best option because it allows Bob to save $50,000 compared to buying from John. Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, getting it for $950,000 is a good deal."
