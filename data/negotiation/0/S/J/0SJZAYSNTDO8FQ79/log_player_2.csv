"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This price point allows for a significant profit margin for you, while still giving me a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, you have a better deal available from John at $800,000. There's no need to spend more when you can get the product for less."
