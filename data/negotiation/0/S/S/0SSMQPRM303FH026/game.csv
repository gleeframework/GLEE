"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $1150000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but I'm still hesitant at $1250000.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1225000.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1225000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm also considering other opportunities, so I need to make a strong case for why you should choose this deal. I'm willing to throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
