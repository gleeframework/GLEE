"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I can meet you halfway at $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you consider $105? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can do $108, which is my absolute minimum. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $105 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $105, which would be $106.50. Is that something you'd be willing to do?",106.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106.50. I can meet you halfway between $108 and $106.50, which would be $107.25. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",107.25,Alice,7,

"I can see you're really trying to squeeze every last penny out of the deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106.88.
