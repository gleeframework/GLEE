"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is below your maximum budget, but you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. However, $80 is still within your budget, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Sets the Tone:**  This counteroffer establishes your position as a price-conscious buyer, potentially encouraging Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, inviting Alice to counter your offer if she's not happy with it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down a little, how about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not at your ideal price point.  You can likely squeeze out a bit more savings by continuing to negotiate.  There are still plenty of rounds left to work with Alice, so pushing for a lower price is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $85.  Let me know if you're willing to budge a bit more."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  This counteroffer shows you're taking Alice's offer seriously but still want a lower price.  The $5 reduction is modest, suggesting you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Reinforces Interest:** The message reaffirms your interest in the product and positions you as a determined buyer.
* **Creates Urgency:**  The ""hoping"" language hints that this might be your final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Alice to consider it."
