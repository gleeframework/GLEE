"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
