Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  Let's start with $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is still below the product's worth to Bob but gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Presenting a Discount:**  By framing the offer as a ""significant discount"", I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I make it clear that I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for a counteroffer from Bob. 

This approach aims to secure a high price while keeping the negotiation process open and encouraging a win-win outcome."
