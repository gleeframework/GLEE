"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000, still above my minimum value of $15,000, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject and try to get a better price in the next round.  I have a feeling I can get closer to $15,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $14,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to work with him and hopefully secure a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still push for a higher price. There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm still confident I can get closer to $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $13,000. This is a small compromise, but I think it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. With only three rounds left, I'm aiming to close the deal as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept $11,000, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $15,000.  I'll hold out and see if I can get a better offer from Bob. It's a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $12,000. This is a significant compromise, but I think it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. With only one round left, I need to be realistic about the possibility of getting closer to my minimum value."
