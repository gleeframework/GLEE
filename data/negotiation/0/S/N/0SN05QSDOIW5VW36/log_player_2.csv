# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?
