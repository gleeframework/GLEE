"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but within a range that might still be acceptable to him. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially make a good profit.  I'm also leaving myself a buffer in case Bob rejects my offer.  If he does, I'll need to decide whether to counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to try to get closer to that number by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob and will bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to get a little bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $150 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round. $135 is a reasonable compromise between our last offers.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't think I can get him to increase his offer enough to meet my target.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiations."
