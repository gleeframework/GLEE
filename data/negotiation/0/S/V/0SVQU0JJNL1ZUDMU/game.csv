"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value in the current market. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle at $725,000?  This shows I'm willing to move, but I also need you to meet me closer to my price range.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
