I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I make a substantial profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If he rejects, we can start a negotiation process.  However, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a decent profit, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product and will likely engage in further negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still ensures a healthy profit. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also keeping the option to sell to John if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than John's,  I'm concerned about the potential for further negotiation rounds to drag on, potentially resulting in a lower price or a deal falling through altogether. By selling to John, I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 and avoid the risk associated with continued negotiations."
