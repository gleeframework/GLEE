Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob (""fantastic deal"") to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** The offer leaves room for negotiation and counteroffers, while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  I have leverage because I can sell to John for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and secure a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially close the gap to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and still leaves room for you to make a great profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer meets Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the potential profit he can make, encouraging him to see the value in my offer.
* **Finality:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution, presenting this as a potentially final offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I can then evaluate whether to accept John's offer or make another counteroffer, depending on how determined Bob seems and how much time I want to invest in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me and the discount you've already given. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.  
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks delaying the sale.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to Bob now secures a good profit and eliminates the risk of Bob backing out or John changing his mind. 

While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential gain at this point."
