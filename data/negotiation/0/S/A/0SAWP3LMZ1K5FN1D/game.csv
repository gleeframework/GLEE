"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $180 for it.",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep, but I've done some research and I think this product is worth more than $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $220.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $220. I'm willing to pay $190 for it.",190.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $190 is a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $200. I think it's a fair price considering the quality and uniqueness of the product.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for it, as I mentioned before.",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're going in circles. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $200, but I need to make it a bit sweeter. I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $50. So, the total price would be $200 for the product and $50 for the accessory, making it a total of $250. However, I'll come down to $230 to make it more attractive. What do you say?",230.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the accessory, but I'm still not willing to pay $230. I'm willing to pay $180 for the product, and I'm willing to take it without the accessory.",180.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $220, and I'm not including the accessory in this offer. I think $220 is a fair price considering the product's quality and value. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",220.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, but I'm still not willing to pay $220. I'm willing to pay $190 for the product.",190.0,Bob,10,
