"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a good deal for you and still allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
