{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000 (Bob's value), but I'm also willing to accept a lower price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's more than my minimum value, it's still less than what I'm aiming for.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a good deal for you and still allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
