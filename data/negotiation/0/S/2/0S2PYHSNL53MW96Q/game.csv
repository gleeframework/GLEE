"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price we both agree on.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $110. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford more.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a fair price. How about $115? That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $115 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's a good compromise for both of us.",112.5,Bob,6,
