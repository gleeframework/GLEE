Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000, so this is a good start.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate, but also leaving you room to bargain upwards. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than $8,000 (John's offer), it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values it at $10,000. However, it brings us closer to my ideal price point.  Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $9,000, Bob's offer of $8,750 is a decent compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and we're running the risk of Bob walking away if I keep pushing.  Let's take this offer and close the deal."
