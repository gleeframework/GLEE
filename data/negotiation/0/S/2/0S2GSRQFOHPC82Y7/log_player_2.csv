"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation, while still leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his initial counteroffer.  Bob has a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's likely that Alice will be willing to compromise a bit more to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $8,500, showing he's willing to compromise, but he's still below Alice's offer of $9,000.  $8,750 represents a significant savings for Bob compared to John's offer, and might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, given that she's already lowered her price."
