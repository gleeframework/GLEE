Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This takes into account your needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.
