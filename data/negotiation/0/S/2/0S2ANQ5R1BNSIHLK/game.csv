"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,750,000.  This price reflects its significant value and gives you a fair deal. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This takes into account your needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
