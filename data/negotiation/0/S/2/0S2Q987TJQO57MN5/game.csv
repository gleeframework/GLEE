"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,200,000.  I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure both of us benefit.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to me.  I believe this is a strong offer that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
