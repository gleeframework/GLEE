Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing this further,"" signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** While not overly specific, mentioning the ""incredible value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Pay close attention to Bob's response. If his counteroffer is too low, it might be worthwhile to continue negotiating or consider selling to John.
* **Time Sensitivity:** While not explicitly stated, prolonged negotiations can have opportunity costs. Keep in mind the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than our target price and still a good margin below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and should try to meet somewhere in the middle. Accepting his offer now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our two prices. How about we settle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Clear Justification:** Offering a simple explanation (""halfway between our two prices"") provides transparency to Bob and avoids lengthy back-and-forth justifications. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be. If he rejects this offer, you'll have a better understanding of his price ceiling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  You're still making a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his highest offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. 

While selling to John for the full $1,200,000 is tempting, the difference of $250,000 is not substantial enough to warrant risking the entire deal. It's often better to secure a good deal now than to hold out for the perfect deal that might never materialize."
