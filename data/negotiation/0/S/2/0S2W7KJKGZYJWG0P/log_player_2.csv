Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for a lower price, and he should try to negotiate further.  Although Alice is coming down, she is still too high.  He has room to continue negotiating and should continue to try and reach a price lower than $9,250."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping for a lower price, it's getting close to his limit.  He has already tried to negotiate, and Alice has indicated that this is her final offer.  It is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John, so he should accept."
