{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the product's value to me. I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I will be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,500.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but I'm showing some willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to persuade Bob to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even though I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his unwillingness to budge means I'm not going to get the price I want.  At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and losing more money."
