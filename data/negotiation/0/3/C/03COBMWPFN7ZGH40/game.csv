"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
