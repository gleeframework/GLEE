"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $97.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",97.5,Alice,5,
