"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $125?  This is a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price.",125.0,Alice,5,
