"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's serious interest in purchasing while also leaving room for negotiation. Alice may counter with a higher price, but Bob will have established a lower starting point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there is still potential to bring the price down further. Bob wants to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a measured approach, gradually increasing his offer.  $1,100,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility and signals that Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is higher than Bob's last counteroffer, it's still below the initial offer from Round 1. Bob has successfully brought the price down and is making progress. It's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to compromise further.  Bob is also aware that he has a backup option in John, so he can afford to be patient and hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. At the same time, he's still holding out for a price lower than Alice's last offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still not close enough to Bob's desired range.  He's been able to push the price lower and doesn't want to settle for a price that's too high, especially since he has the option of buying from John.  He's also already made six counteroffers, so there are only four rounds left. This makes it more important to try and squeeze out a lower price, especially as the negotiation window is shrinking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a strong counteroffer by raising his bid to $1,200,000. This move shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he still wants a better deal than her current offer of $1,350,000.  With only three rounds left, Bob needs to close the gap quickly.  This counteroffer might tempt Alice to accept, or it could prompt her to make a final, lower counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is not acceptable to Bob. While he has managed to lower the price from $1,500,000, he is unwilling to pay that much, especially with a single round remaining. It's not worth risking a further round with Alice, as it might result in a price higher than $1,400,000. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative in John, who is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John. He can secure the product for a slightly higher price than his ideal price point, but it's the safer and more guaranteed option, ensuring he gets the product within the remaining timeframe."
