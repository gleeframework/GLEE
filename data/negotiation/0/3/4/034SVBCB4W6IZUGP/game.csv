"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,500,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,100,000 undervalues it significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a fair price considering its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
