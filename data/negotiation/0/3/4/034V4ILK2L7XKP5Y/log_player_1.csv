"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

I'm going to drop my price again to $1,050,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm starting to get a bit nervous about running out of rounds, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We are running out of time and I'm not sure I can get Bob to go higher.  While I would prefer a higher price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on the deal completely."
