Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. It's possible he might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle on a price higher than $120.
* **Alternative Secured:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we don't lose out. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price."
