Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You've set your minimum at $1,200,000, so this price gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still potential for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is brief and focused on the price.

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation and counteroffers. You can adjust the price higher or lower depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This seems like a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what you believe the product is worth.  You want to maximize your profit and can likely negotiate a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

You will send a counteroffer to Bob. You can aim for a price between $1,300,000 and $1,450,000. This will show that you are willing to negotiate but not settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good option because:

* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway by offering a price between your previous offer and his offer.
* **It's still profitable:**  This price is above your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It shows you're serious about negotiating:** You're not accepting his first counteroffer, but you're also showing flexibility. 

This strategy increases your chances of reaching a deal while still trying to secure a higher price."
