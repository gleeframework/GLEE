"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'd find it really valuable.  I'm asking $200 for it to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $200 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm genuinely interested in the product but need a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $155 is still too high. We're getting closer to my limit, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about $130?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

We're splitting the difference again, moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with. This also emphasizes my willingness to be reasonable and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, Bob, you've been moving up consistently.  To show I'm serious too, let's make it $145.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting close, but her ""final offer"" of $145 is still above my $100 limit. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed option with John at a much lower price.  It's been a good negotiation with Alice, but it's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
