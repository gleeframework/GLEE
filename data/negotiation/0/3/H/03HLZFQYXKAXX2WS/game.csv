"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds tremendous value for your business, even more than the base price I've set for it. I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's value to me is quite a bit higher.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value it brings to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
