Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move closer to my price point. While selling to John is an option, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
