Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a reasonable premium for Bob, considering the product is worth the same amount to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, still above my minimum value but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation that could end with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
