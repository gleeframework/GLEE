{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer. $1,100,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer,  but still above Bob's maximum budget. This allows for negotiation room and signals Bob's seriousness in acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, it's still worth continuing the negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, but he needs to be realistic.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement."
