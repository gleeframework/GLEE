"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal, but knowing I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob isn't willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, I still think I can get closer to my minimum goal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come closer to my target price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to risk settling for less than I can potentially earn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's last offer. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is very close to my minimum goal, I'm still hoping for a bit more. There are only four rounds left, so I'm taking a calculated risk and rejecting Bob's offer in hopes of pushing him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get closer to my minimum goal.  With only three rounds left, I need to find a compromise that both Bob and I can accept.  This price is a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision.  With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with nothing.  While $990,000 is still slightly below my minimum goal, it's a very good deal considering the circumstances. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
