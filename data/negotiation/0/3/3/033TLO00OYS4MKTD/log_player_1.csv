Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more. By setting the price at $1,500,000, you're aiming to tap into any potential perceived value beyond the $1,000,000 mark.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then potentially settle on a price higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
