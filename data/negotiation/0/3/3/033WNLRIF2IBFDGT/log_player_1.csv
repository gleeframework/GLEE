"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price as justified due to the product's ""incredible value and potential."" This helps anchor the price in Bob's mind and sets the tone for a negotiation where value, not just cost, is considered. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping in mind the fallback option of John. This strategy allows me to:

* **Test Bob's limits:**  See how high Bob is willing to go and understand his price sensitivity.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  Even if Bob counters low, I'll be negotiating down from a strong starting point.
* **Leave room for concessions:**  As we move through the rounds, I can make calculated concessions to entice Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests he's very interested but trying to anchor the price lower. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground. I'll also emphasize the product's unique value to justify the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While $2,000,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects a balance between its true worth and my desire to see it in the hands of someone who understands its value."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $200,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his price point.
* **Justification:** I'm still framing the price around the product's value, emphasizing its ""true worth"" to justify the higher price tag.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By stating my desire to see it in the hands of someone who understands its value, I'm subtly implying that other buyers (like John) might be interested, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a sweet spot between Bob's perceived value and my desired profit. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still allowing room for further concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,800,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:**  We seem to be settling into a pattern of $200,000 counteroffers.  Continuing might lead to drawn-out negotiations.
* **Losing Bob:**  Bob has indicated he's actively trying to find a fair price. Pushing too hard could make him walk away, leaving me with John's offer as my only option. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting $1,600,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
