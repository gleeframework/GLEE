"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While $2,000,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects a balance between its true worth and my desire to see it in the hands of someone who understands its value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,800,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
