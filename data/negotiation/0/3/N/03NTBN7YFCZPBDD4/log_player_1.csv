```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fantastic deal for you. This price reflects the product's value and my desire to make this transaction happen.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to what I'm hoping for, I'm still within the negotiation window and believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This price gives you a great deal on a product you value highly, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $9,750 is a good price and getting closer to my desired outcome. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely."
