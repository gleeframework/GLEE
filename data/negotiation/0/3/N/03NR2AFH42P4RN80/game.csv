"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000 for the product? I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the value of this product and the interest from other buyers, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $1,200,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both our financial positions.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
