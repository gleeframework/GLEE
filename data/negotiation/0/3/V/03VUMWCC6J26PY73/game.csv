"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can't afford more than $850,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
