"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This is still a very good price for you, given the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd like to make a compromise at $980,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $980,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above $1,015,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $990,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
