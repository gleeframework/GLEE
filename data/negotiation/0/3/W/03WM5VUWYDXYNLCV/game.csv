"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects its worth, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
