"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I still cannot justify spending more than $775,000 on this product. I would like to propose $775,000 as a reasonable price for us both.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
