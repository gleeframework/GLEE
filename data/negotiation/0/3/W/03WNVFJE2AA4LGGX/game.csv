"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. However, $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This product is really worth it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my limit.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but this product is truly worth the investment.  I could go down to $125, final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I've got another offer for $100.  If you can match that, I'll buy it from you right now.",100.0,Bob,6,
