I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 from him or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I've negotiated with Bob for a few rounds, but we're not getting closer to a deal.  It's time to take John's offer of $1,000,000, which is a safe and reasonable price for me.  While I would like to get more, I'm not willing to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since he seems unwilling to budge much."
