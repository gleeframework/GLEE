"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you presenting the product's value. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
