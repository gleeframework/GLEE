Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than you realize. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and potentially securing a deal.
* **Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously, highlighting the value proposition.

**Strategy:**

This approach allows for a potential negotiation while setting a clear expectation of the value of the product. It also keeps the option open to sell to John if Bob is not willing to meet a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and demonstrating flexibility while setting a clear price expectation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate.  It also tests the waters to see if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our price expectations. It's better for me to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price or a drawn-out negotiation."
