"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident it will provide significant value to your business.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
