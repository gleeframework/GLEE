"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,260,000.  This is a competitive price for such a valuable asset.",1260000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,260,000 is beyond my current budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,230,000. This brings us closer together, while still respecting my financial limits.",1230000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your willingness to compromise, and to meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,245,000 for the product. This feels like a fair deal considering its inherent value.",1245000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. In light of our ongoing dialogue, I am willing to consider $1,240,000 as a fair price for the product. This represents a significant reduction from my initial proposal and I believe it strikes a balance between our respective positions.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
