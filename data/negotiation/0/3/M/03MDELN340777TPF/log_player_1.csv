Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what you could gain from it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential to Bob helps justify the higher price, even though it's above his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a bit of risk. If Bob is turned off by the high initial price, you might miss out on a deal. However, it maximizes your potential gain."
