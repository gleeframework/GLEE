Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. While selling to John is becoming more appealing, there's still room to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I can't go lower than $1,225,000. This offer takes into account your interest while acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,225,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1,050,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from this point, and the negotiations are becoming very incremental. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
