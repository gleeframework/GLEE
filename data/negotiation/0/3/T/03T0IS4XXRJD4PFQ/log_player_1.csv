Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,500, which is $12,000. Can we meet at $12,000?

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting $12,000 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
