{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This ensures that Bob sees the potential for a good deal and is likely to engage in negotiations rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000). I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
