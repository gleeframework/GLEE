"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is below her stated value, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:**  My goal is to save as much money as possible, and this offer reflects that while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** I anticipate Alice will likely counter-offer, and this gives us both space to find a price that works."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my alternative price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as I've reached the best possible outcome."
