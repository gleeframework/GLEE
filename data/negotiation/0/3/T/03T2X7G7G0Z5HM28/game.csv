,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $15,000? That would be fair to both of us, considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $13,500 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,250. This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
