Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than his initial counteroffer, it's still too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $15,000? That would be fair to both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more, especially considering John is willing to pay $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $13,500 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my desired price. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower offer from Bob."
