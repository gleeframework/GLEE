Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $90. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push Alice further, getting the price down to $90 is a good deal. It's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to settle for John's $80 offer."
