Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I believe the product has a much higher value and am confident we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for this product. It has exceptional value and potential, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly adjusted price of $1,200,000. This allows for some room for negotiation, but also reflects the true worth of this opportunity. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $800000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be within my budget. How about $950000? Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I am willing to continue negotiating, but I need a price that reflects the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $950,000 still doesn't quite meet the value of this product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price is firm, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the potential this product holds for your business. Let's close this deal and unlock its benefits for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm selling the product to John for $1,000,000. While I appreciate Bob's continued interest, his offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. With John's offer, I can secure a sale that meets my financial requirements, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob that could ultimately result in a lower price or a failed deal."
