Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's low offer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is far too low for me. I understand it's worth less to you, but I need to make a decent profit.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
Bob is offering the exact amount the product is worth to him, which is the best I can realistically get in this scenario.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by being too stubborn."
