"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject and counteroffer to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's start from here and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $1,500,000. While it's closer, I still need to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. Let's try $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value for me, and it gives us both room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
