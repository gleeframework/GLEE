Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,999.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **High but Negotiable:** $14,999 is a high price, close to your minimum, but it leaves a little wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" to entice Bob while not revealing how much lower you'd be willing to go. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the sale secure."
