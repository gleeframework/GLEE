"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
