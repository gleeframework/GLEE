"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for Bob's initial offer of $800,000. I need to aim for a higher price to meet my minimum goal of $800,000 and ideally get closer to the $1,000,000 value Bob places on it.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. However, $800,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would still allow you a significant profit margin."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000. How about we try $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $850,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum requirement and represents a good compromise.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob in future negotiations, but it's important to keep moving forward and securing the sale."
