"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, I need to maintain a certain price point for our product to ensure profitability. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose an offer of $9,000 for the product. This is the best price I can offer given our costs and market positioning. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a very fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
