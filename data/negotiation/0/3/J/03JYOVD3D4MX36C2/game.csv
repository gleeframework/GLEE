"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I see the value in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you see the value in the product, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I bring to the table.",8500.0,Alice,5,
