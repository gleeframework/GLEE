Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's valuation is irrelevant:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you shouldn't sell for less than that. 
* **Start high:** Even though Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more. Starting with your ideal price gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Direct communication:**  The message is clear and to the point, offering the product and stating the price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit. If Bob accepts, you get the best possible price. If he rejects it, you still have John as a backup."
