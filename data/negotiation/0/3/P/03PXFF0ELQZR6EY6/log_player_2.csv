"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible and $1,025,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is running out of rounds and Alice has made a significant concession.  Accepting the offer at $1,075,000 is the best option at this point, as it is still below Bob's maximum price."
