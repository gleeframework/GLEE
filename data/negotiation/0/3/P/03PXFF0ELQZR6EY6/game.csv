"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
