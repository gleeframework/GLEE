"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially get it for cheaper.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the offer!  $115 is a good starting point. How about we split the difference and meet at $122.50? That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $122.50 is a good compromise, and it's still within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my next offer, and I'd end up having to buy from John for $150. Accepting this offer gives me a good deal without risking losing the product to a higher price."
