Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the value surplus, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with $150,000 above your minimum and gives Bob a $50,000 incentive to buy from you instead of missing out.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John is your backup) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball you.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how much you're willing to move from your initial price to secure the deal."
