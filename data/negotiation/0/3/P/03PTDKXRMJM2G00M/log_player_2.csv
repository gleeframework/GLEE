"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.  She knows you have an alternative (John) and might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
