"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly and optimistic tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product can make Bob more willing to consider a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to get closer to my desired price point while still keeping Bob engaged.  I will also be evaluating Bob's counteroffers and the remaining rounds to determine if I should accept a lower price or move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I have more rounds left and can try to negotiate a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I will also be considering the remaining rounds and Bob's willingness to negotiate when determining my next counteroffer.  However, if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge, I will likely move to sell to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving slightly lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that suggests I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive and open tone:** The message encourages further negotiation and aims to keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my target.  I will closely observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum price of $15,000, I still have more negotiation rounds available. I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John right now would mean forfeiting any opportunity to earn more.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that's closer to my desired range. I will also continue to evaluate Bob's willingness to negotiate and consider the number of remaining rounds when deciding on my counteroffer.  However, if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While I value your offer,  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $10,750?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not settling for his last price.  This shows him that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm understanding of the product's value.
* **Fairness and Value:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is a fair price that takes into account both the product's worth and Bob's budget.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** The message conveys a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. It's a compromise that shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but still allows for some room for negotiation if Bob isn't ready to agree yet. I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly as we proceed through the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,200 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, I still have more negotiation rounds available.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher, as I'm still closer to my minimum than to Bob's desired price.  Also, selling to John right now would mean forfeiting any opportunity to earn more. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that's closer to my desired range.  I'll consider the number of remaining rounds and Bob's willingness to negotiate when deciding on my counteroffer. If Bob continues to be unwilling to budge, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still quite a bit below my desired price. However, I want to see if we can find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal fairly. Would you be willing to consider this final offer?"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm using the word ""final"" to imply that I'm reaching the end of my negotiation flexibility. This can add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to seriously consider my offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise from my previous offer. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and how the offered price reflects its worth.

**Strategy:**

This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob before considering selling to John. I'm aiming for a final price that's as close to my desired range as possible.  The ""final offer"" tactic creates pressure on Bob while remaining open to a possible agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,400, which would be $10,300. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the price is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a significant loss for me. It's unlikely I can get a significantly better price with Bob in the next round, considering his budget constraints.  While I'd love to earn more, I don't want to risk missing out on John's guaranteed offer, which is closer to my desired value. 

**Strategy:**

I'm opting for the safe and guaranteed option with John.  Selling to John now ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price."
