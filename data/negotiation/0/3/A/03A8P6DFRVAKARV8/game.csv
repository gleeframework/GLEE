"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15000? It's a fair compromise that allows me to still make a profit, and hopefully, it's still within your budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13500. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
