"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a great price for it. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm getting a good deal, and you're still making a profit. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
