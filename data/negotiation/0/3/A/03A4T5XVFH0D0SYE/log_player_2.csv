"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price. Although it's a significant discount from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is still above my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a decent price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Even though Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, Bob should reject this offer and try to get a lower price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John for $800,000 if a deal with Alice doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $920,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, it seems unlikely that she'll come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
