"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $22,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $19,000. This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $19,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm happy to go up to $15,000, which is a fair compromise, given my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
