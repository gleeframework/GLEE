"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
