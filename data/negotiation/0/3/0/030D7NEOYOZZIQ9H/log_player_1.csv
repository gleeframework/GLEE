"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gives Bob a sense that the product is valuable. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price of $1,200,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure the negotiation remains open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to keep negotiating to get closer to my desired value. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This is a firm price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price. If he rejects this, I'm likely to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but it's time to cut my losses.  I'm not confident that Bob will meet my price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to secure a guaranteed sale and ensure I get my minimum price."
