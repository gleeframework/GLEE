"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price, especially considering the benefits it offers.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This offer reflects a balance between its true worth and my desire to see it put to good use.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While the $1,250,000 offer is tempting, I'm still confident this product can bring you a much higher return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
