**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unwilling to meet Alice's minimum price.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob, but there's a risk he'll walk away. Selling to John for $80 guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
