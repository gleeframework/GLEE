Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's worth pushing for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
