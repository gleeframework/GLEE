{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate. It also leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is still a fair price for the product, and I believe it's a great value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9250. How about we split the difference and settle on $9125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$9,125 is a good price, considering Bob's initial offer of $9,000.  It's close enough to my desired price point, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more."
