Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the deal being good for both parties. This can make Bob more receptive to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for counteroffers from Bob without significantly impacting my desired profit. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I'll secure the deal.
* If the negotiations drag on, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Risk of losing to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000,  I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob first.

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll try to bridge the gap between our positions and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** $950,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive framing:** I reiterate that the offer is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he accepts, I'll secure the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to offer $900,000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $900,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better price from him. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out and potentially lead to a better offer from Bob, but it also increases the risk of him backing out or the opportunity cost of selling to John. 

**Next steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and secure the deal for $900,000. This is a good outcome considering the risk of losing a sale to Bob or the opportunity cost of selling to John."
