"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $7,500 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide.",8500.0,Alice,5,
