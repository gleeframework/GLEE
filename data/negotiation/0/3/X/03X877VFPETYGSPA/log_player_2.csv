"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point. While $10,000 isn't terrible, there's room for negotiation. I should counter with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Polite and professional:**  Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Shows interest:**  Expressing interest can encourage Alice to work with me.
* **Significant but not insulting counter:**  $6,500 is a substantial decrease from $10,000, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still a significant difference from John's offer.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledging Alice's movement:** Showing Alice we recognize her willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive tone. 
* **Firm but fair counter:** $7,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant step up from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to be flexible, but it keeps me below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Sense of urgency:** By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm subtly encouraging a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $7,500 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at $8,500 and has stated it's her final offer. Since I have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to go with John.  While I might be able to negotiate Alice down a little more, the potential savings are likely to be small. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
