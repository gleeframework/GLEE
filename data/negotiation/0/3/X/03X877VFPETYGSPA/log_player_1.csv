``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $8,000 but below your minimum of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and it's not even close to my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer.  I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $7,500 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 8500}
