Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing it's likely Bob will reject this offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer, giving me a better understanding of where we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too low for me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get an even lower offer. Selling to John for $100 ensures I meet my minimum while avoiding the uncertainty of further rounds."
