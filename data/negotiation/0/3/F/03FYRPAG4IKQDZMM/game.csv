"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also being a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step for me. This price reflects the value I see in the product while acknowledging the potential it holds for your business.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
