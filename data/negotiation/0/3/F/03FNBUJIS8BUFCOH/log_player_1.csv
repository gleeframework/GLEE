Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.  Therefore, we should start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:**  The message includes a justification for the high price, emphasizing the product's value and framing it as a pre-public listing opportunity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $19,000, there's room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. If Bob rejects this offer, we know we have a fallback option with John."
