# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1450000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you could pay $1,500,000 to John, Alice is offering the same product for $1,450,000. 
* **You save money.** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The deal is still within your budget.**  Your maximum price was $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that."
