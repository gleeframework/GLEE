"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120). 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds, allowing me to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120 and even below Bob's perceived value of $80.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.  
* **Potential to Improve:** By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Not Yet Desperate:** It's only the second round, so there's no need to rush into selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $85 leaves room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Maintaining Control:**  I'm still in the driver's seat, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $70 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still push Bob closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer.
* **Time is On My Side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore other options without feeling pressured.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $70 is closer, but I need to get at least $80 for the product. Let's meet halfway at $75.  I think that's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $75, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Again, emphasizing ""fair deal for both of us"" appeals to Bob's sense of reason and encourages him to accept.
* **Pressure to Accept:**  With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to put some pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage and allows me to hold firm on my price."
