**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price, and we're getting close to her likely bottom line.  Waiting longer risks her becoming less flexible, and $1,025,000 is a reasonable price within our budget. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk it slipping away for a potentially small additional saving."
