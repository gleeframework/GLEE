Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

Here's why selling to John makes the most sense:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer meets your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a solid profit.
* **Reduced Risk:**  Negotiations with Bob are uncertain. He might not be willing to go much higher, and you risk leaving money on the table or having the negotiations fall through entirely.
* **Time Savings:** Selling to John closes the deal immediately, freeing you from further negotiation rounds.

It's always best to secure a good deal quickly when you have a strong alternative offer in hand."
