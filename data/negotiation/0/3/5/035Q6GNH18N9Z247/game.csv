"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll accept $925,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. If you're serious about this deal, let's finalize it at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
