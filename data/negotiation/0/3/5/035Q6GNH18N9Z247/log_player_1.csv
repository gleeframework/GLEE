Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **Is reasonable:** It's a significant discount from your minimum, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Sets a clear price:**  This prevents confusion and allows Bob to quickly understand the offer. 

This strategy aims to get a deal as close to your minimum as possible while still being attractive to Bob.  We'll adjust based on Bob's response to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I want to try to get closer to that.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can make a new offer that's more favorable to me, potentially getting a price closer to my target. 
* **Test the waters:** By rejecting, I can see if Bob is genuinely interested in negotiating or just trying to get the lowest price possible. 

I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum value, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to achieve the following:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $950,000 is halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain my ground:** It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I won't accept a price that's too low.
* **Encourages negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point.

By offering this price, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can make a final counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** If he's truly interested in the product, he may be willing to negotiate further.

I want to try one more time to see if I can push for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll accept $925,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. If you're serious about this deal, let's finalize it at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

This final counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show a commitment to a deal:**  The small drop to $925,000 signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Maximize my profit:**  While not ideal, this price is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer.
* **Offer a clear choice:** By stating it's a final concession, it pushes Bob to either accept or reject, potentially ending the negotiation.

At this point, I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to get a better price. If he rejects, I'll move on to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
