"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find more reasonable.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $700,000 is pushing my budget.  I could do $625,000, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you think?",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you the product for $675,000. This is the next lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference and call it $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $665,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",665000.0,Alice,9,
