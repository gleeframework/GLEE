Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $10,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I can get from John. This gives Bob a potential gain, while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, while also framing the offer as a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

By offering a price between Bob's value and my minimum value, I'm trying to find a sweet spot where:

* Bob might be tempted by the deal, as he's getting the product for a price lower than its worth to him. 
* I'm still making a profit, although lower than the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a quicker sale and a higher profit than selling to John."
