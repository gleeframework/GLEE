"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you're aiming for a premium.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While you know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting too close to his valuation might seem insulting or make him question its actual worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A significant gap between your initial offer and your minimum allows for concessions during the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still substantially below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your desired amount. 

It's time to counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial assessment of the product's value remains unchanged. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price, but not drastically.
* **Hold Firm:** The decrease is significant enough to encourage Bob while remaining above your $1,200,000 baseline. You're signaling that you're serious but open to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain Value:**  You're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.  This keeps the focus on the product's worth and not just the negotiation itself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Considering your revised offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to find a middle ground, but his latest offer is still below your absolute minimum.  While it's getting closer, you're not losing anything by continuing the negotiation for another round or two. You have the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To be frank, I have a hard limit on this product, and I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,037,500. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other options if we can't agree."",
""product_price"": 1037500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer meets Bob almost exactly halfway between his last offer and your previous one. It shows significant movement on your part while still holding a slight premium over your $1,200,000 baseline and John's offer. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency. It signals to Bob that you're serious and encourages him to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation unnecessarily.
* **Implied Alternative:** You subtly remind Bob that you have other options (John) without explicitly threatening to walk away. This maintains a collaborative tone while reinforcing the value of your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your hard limit. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope you can consider this offer and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm, and while his offer is tempting, it's still below your guaranteed sale price from John. Bob has shown he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
