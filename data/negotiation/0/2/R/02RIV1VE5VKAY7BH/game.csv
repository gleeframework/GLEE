"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer of $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I think that's a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,250 is still a bit too high. How about we try $12,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $12,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
