{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($15,000), but I'm also acknowledging that Bob values the product less. By starting at $14,000, I leave room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer of $12,000, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'll counter with a higher price and continue to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer of $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,250 is still a bit too high. How about we try $12,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if I can get Bob to budge further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $12,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $13,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
