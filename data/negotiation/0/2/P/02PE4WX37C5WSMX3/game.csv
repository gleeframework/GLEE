"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  It's truly one-of-a-kind and I value it highly.  To kick off our negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point, considering its potential value to you.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  It has considerable value beyond even your initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market price of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,200,000 is still considerably less than what I'm willing to accept. My final offer is $1,275,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me and the market price of similar products.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
