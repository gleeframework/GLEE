"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $11,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
