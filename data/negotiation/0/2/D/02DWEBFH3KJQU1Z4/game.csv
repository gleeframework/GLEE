"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,700. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,200, so I'll counter with $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
