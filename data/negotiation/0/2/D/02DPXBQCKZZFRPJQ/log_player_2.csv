Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $107.50. How about we meet at $112? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but in smaller increments.  At this point, the difference between her offer ($112) and John's price ($150) is significant enough to accept. Further haggling might not yield a much better result."
