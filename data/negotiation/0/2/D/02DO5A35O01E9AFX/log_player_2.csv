# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product for $1175000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the profit I'm willing to make. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,175,000 is still above your ideal budget. There's still room for negotiation.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your $1,000,000 goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a good price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll offer the product for $1125000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the profit I'm willing to make. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to negotiate, her last offer of $1,125,000 is still above your comfort zone. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to further counteroffers, but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. It's time to secure the product and avoid any further delays or risks."
