"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $10500 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $10000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're still valuing the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9800. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the highest I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $10200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
