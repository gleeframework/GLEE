"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down in price, and you have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows my willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for potential compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum, I still want to try and negotiate a lower price. I'm confident I can get it closer to my target, and if not, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is the best deal I've seen so far. While it is slightly above my target price, it's still worth buying the product from Alice instead of going with John's offer and saving $100,000."
