This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$800,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  $1,250,000 is a fair compromise given the product's value to me.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a deal I'm comfortable with.  I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap further.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer."
