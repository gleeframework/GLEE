,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Can we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. While I would prefer to sell the product at a higher price, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider $110 for the product, as it's still above the value you place on it. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the slight reduction, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $105. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I hope this meets your expectations.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit off from the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $100, and I'm willing to throw in a small favor to sweeten the deal. Can we meet at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your desire to reach an agreement, and I appreciate your offer of a small favor. However, I am unable to accept $100 for the product. I'm willing to compromise at $102.50, which still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $102.50, so I'm thinking of $101.25. Can we meet at that price?",101.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued negotiation, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you at $101.50 for the product. This allows me to maintain a satisfactory profit margin while being fair to you.",101.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $100, and I'm willing to make it a final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options. Can we meet at $100?",100.0,Bob,10,
