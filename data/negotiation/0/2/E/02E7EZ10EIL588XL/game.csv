"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits us both. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,200. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
