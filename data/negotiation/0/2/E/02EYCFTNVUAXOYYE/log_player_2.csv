"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own perceived value."
