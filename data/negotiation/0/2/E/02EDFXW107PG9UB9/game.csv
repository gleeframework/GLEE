"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a sign of good faith. This reflects its real value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means.",850000.0,Bob,4,
