"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Let's find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
