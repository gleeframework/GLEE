Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
