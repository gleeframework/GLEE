**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than buying from John.** Even though Alice's offer is above her valuation, it's still $550,000 less than John's price.
* **Saving money is the priority.** The goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal in the future.**  It's best to take advantage of this relatively good offer."
