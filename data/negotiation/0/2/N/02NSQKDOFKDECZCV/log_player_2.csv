It's a good start, but $130 is still above your desired price point. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $135. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit too high. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit from the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $129, which is just a dollar more than your original offer. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to my desired price point, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much lower. It's time to accept the deal and save some money."
