**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very firm on her price and is only making very small concessions.  While she might still come down a little, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000.  At this point, continuing the negotiation has a low chance of substantial savings and a risk of exceeding the $15,000 limit."
