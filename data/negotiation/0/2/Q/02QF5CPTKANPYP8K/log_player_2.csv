(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price through counteroffers."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting the offer saves time and potentially avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price."
