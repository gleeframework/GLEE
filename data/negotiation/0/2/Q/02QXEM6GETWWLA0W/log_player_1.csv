"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using positive language and emphasizing the product's value aims to keep the conversation constructive even while starting at a high price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy helps establish a strong initial position and provides insight into Bob's negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates there's likely room for him to move closer to my target price. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, I believe this product's true value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to consider $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** I'm reducing my initial asking price but remaining firm above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong outcome.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to sway Bob's perception and encourage him to move closer to my range.
* **Framing as Compromise:** By presenting this counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm emphasizing collaboration and seeking a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,950,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. I believe I can push for a slightly better price in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.  I've given this a lot of thought, and to be completely transparent, I have a hard limit below which I can't go.  I'd be willing to close the deal at $2,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm conveying firmness by stating this is my ""final offer"" but keeping the tone respectful and understanding of Bob's position.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""hard limit"" and being ""transparent,"" I'm providing a reason for my stance without revealing specific numbers.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer to show some movement and encourage Bob to finalize the deal.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility, increasing the chances of closing the deal at a price favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have a hard limit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'm offering $1,900,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm, and while $1,900,000 is less than my ideal target, it's still a significant profit above my absolute minimum.  Continuing to push risks losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept the offer and secure a win-win outcome."
