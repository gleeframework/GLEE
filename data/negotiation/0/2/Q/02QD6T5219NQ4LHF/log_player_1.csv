Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price allows for potential negotiation and compromise, making a deal more likely. 
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he is interested. This allows for continued negotiation.
* **John is a Secure Alternative:** I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a bad deal. 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $120 is a significant step down from my initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $120 is above my minimum of $150, so I'm not losing money on this deal.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $120 is still a lower price than my initial offer, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation process alive, with the potential for a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's worth more to you, but I have a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **John is a Better Option:** I can sell to John for $150, which is a much more profitable deal.
* **Negotiation is Exhausted:** Bob's offer is already a compromise, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome.

I'm going to sell the product to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really not comfortable going any lower than $110. It's a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Last Try:** While I'm leaning towards selling to John, I'm making one last counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. 
* **Small Compromise:** This price is only slightly lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still above my minimum.
* **Finality:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my lowest price.  This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **John is Still the Backup:** I'm not giving up on John as a buyer, but I'm still open to a deal with Bob if it makes sense."
