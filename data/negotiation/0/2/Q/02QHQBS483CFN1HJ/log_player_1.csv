Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. If Bob rejects my offer, I will evaluate his counteroffer and see if it's worth my time to continue negotiating. If not, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he rejects, I'll have to reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm happy to accept it. Selling to John would net me less, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  I'm willing to close the deal at this price."
