"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far too low. My product is worth significantly more than that. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still reflects the value of my product. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  There's still time to get a better price, and I'm not going to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is my floor price, and I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of my product and come to an agreement. If he doesn't, I'm willing to sell to John for this price, as it is my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give up a significant amount of value.  I've reached my limit in terms of how much I'm willing to drop the price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
