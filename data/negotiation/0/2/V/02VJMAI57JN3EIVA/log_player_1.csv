Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000 (he won't pay more than this).
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer at your desired price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  There's a ""sweet spot"" to find.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** Starting with a strong, confident tone sets the stage for a potentially higher sale price. 
* **Higher Price:** $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus from pure price to the benefits he'd receive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below $1,000,000.
* **Walk Away Point:**  If Bob remains unwilling to meet a price that's acceptable to you, politely decline and proceed with selling to John. You have a strong alternative!"
