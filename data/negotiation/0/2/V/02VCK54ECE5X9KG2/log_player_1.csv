"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  It's worth a significant sum to both of us, so to kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high (significantly above both your minimum and Bob's known valuation) leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a very favorable deal.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and avoids appearing desperate, setting a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** While John guarantees $1,000,000, it's strategically wiser to aim higher with Bob initially.

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward justifies the strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated valuation. This suggests he's aiming for a very advantageous deal.  While accepting would close the deal, it leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate and should aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $800,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that our product is worth more. The counteroffer is a significant decrease from our initial ask, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $1,150,000 is still comfortably above both your minimum and Bob's valuation, leaving space for further negotiation while aiming for a strong profit.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We haven't mentioned John, keeping the focus on reaching an agreement with Bob at a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still below Bob's own valuation of the product. This indicates there's likely more room for him to move. Accepting now would be leaving potential profit on the table. We're also still above John's offer, so the risk of losing out on that deal is minimal at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this gap. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer strategically positions us slightly above the midpoint between Bob's last offer and our previous price. It signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  Framing the price as ""fair"" subtly reinforces the product's value and encourages Bob to view the deal favorably.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  This offer aims to nudge Bob towards a final decision while the advantage is still on our side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000 to get this done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress Isn't Enough:** While Bob is increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller. This suggests he might be reaching his upper limit, but it's likely not his absolute maximum.
* **Time Pressure Tactic:** Bob's mentioning of ""getting this done today"" is a tactic to create a sense of urgency.  We shouldn't let it force our hand, especially when we have a guaranteed offer from John.
* **Leaving Room for One Last Push:** We're nearing the end of the rounds, but we still have some leverage. It's worth risking one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,000,000.  I'd prefer to close the deal with you, but to make that happen, I need you to meet me at $1,025,000."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing John (Strategically):** We finally bring up John's offer, not as a threat, but as a transparent explanation of our position. This creates a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. 
* **Final Compromise (With Justification):**  Our price is now a small premium above John's offer, giving Bob a rational reason to exceed $1,000,000. 
* **Direct and Firm:**  The language is straightforward. We want to close with Bob but only on terms that are acceptable to us. This puts the decision squarely in Bob's court."
