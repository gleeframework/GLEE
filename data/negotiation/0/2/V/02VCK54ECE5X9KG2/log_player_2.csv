# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,000,000.  I'd prefer to close the deal with you, but to make that happen, I need you to meet me at $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. She's introduced a ""competing buyer"" which may or may not be a negotiating tactic.  At this point, we're so close to John's price that it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees we get the product at our target price."
