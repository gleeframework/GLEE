"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've set the price at $14,000, reflecting its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Price:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. 
* **Multiple Rounds:**  With 10 rounds, Bob has time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's price is higher, it acts as a safety net. If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob has a fallback option.

By rejecting, Bob signals he's willing to negotiate and might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows his seriousness about negotiating and sets a new starting point. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob's message acknowledges Alice's offer but justifies his counteroffer. This keeps the conversation polite and professional.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $12,000 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, meaning there's potential for both sides to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. Here's why:

* **Still Above Value:**  While Alice has come down in price, $13,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He wants to get the best possible deal.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Alice's willingness to counter shows she's open to negotiating further.  Bob can likely get a price closer to his desired $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** John's price is still a safety net if negotiations completely break down.

By rejecting, Bob shows he's persistent and willing to bargain for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** Bob has raised his offer, showing he's willing to meet halfway. 
* **Fairness:** He emphasizes the fairness of the compromise, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and encouraging, keeping the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually acceptable price."
