"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I consider a fair price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's the same as his previous offer.  I want to keep pushing for a better price and see if I can convince him to come up a bit more.  I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that gives me a good profit.

It's getting close to the point where I may have to consider selling to John, but I'm still optimistic that I can close a deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to settle for $825,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $850,000.  This is close to Bob's last offer, and I'm willing to meet him halfway.  If he rejects this, I'll be forced to accept John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still being lower than my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting stuck in a negotiation that's unlikely to lead to a better outcome.  I'm willing to cut my losses and move on to other opportunities."
