"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find an agreement with you, I can't accept $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be firm on the price. My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering its value. Let me know your decision.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're being firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,225,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
