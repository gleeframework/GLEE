"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at a price higher than your maximum and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay above your limit.  This gives you a chance to negotiate a better price or proceed with buying from John at your desired price point."
