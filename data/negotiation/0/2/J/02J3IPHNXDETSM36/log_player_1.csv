Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting slightly above the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000) to create room for negotiation.
* **Confidence and Value:**  My message highlights the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This can encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  
*  If the negotiations stall, I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. This price is still fair given the value of the product, and it allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm still willing to negotiate. Bob's message suggests he's open to finding a solution, indicating there's room to compromise. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or at least my minimum acceptable price. I'll need to consider Bob's financial constraints and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,175,000? This still leaves room for a profit for you while ensuring I get a fair price for my valuable product. I'm open to continuing this discussion to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Not Too Much:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value and Profit:** I'm reiterating the product's value and the potential for profit for both of us. This keeps the focus on finding a win-win solution.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussions, indicating my flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a better price than his initial offer.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiations:** If he rejects, I'll have to decide if a further compromise is necessary or if it's time to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's closer to what I can afford. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Compromise from Both Sides:** Both of us have made compromises throughout the negotiation, and this offer feels like a fair compromise.
* **Risk of Losing John:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, there's a risk that John might change his mind or find another option.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John or facing a prolonged negotiation process."
