Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  Going too close to his maximum ($1,200,000) leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair and attractive offer for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're highlighting the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is firmly within the ZOPA. It provides a potential profit margin of $150,000 for Bob while securing you a significant gain above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing fairness and attractiveness suggests this is a well-considered price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
