"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to me, but I am confident it will be an even greater asset to you. Given its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than what many would pay. Considering its true worth and the potential it holds for you, I am offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects a thoughtful balance between the product's value and my desire to ensure you receive a fair deal.

Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed to finalize the transaction. I am looking forward to the possibility of working together and bringing this valuable product into your possession.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, you know you have John as a backup option willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity:

* **Alice might make a counter-offer:** Since she wants to sell the product, she might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale to John. 
* **You can leverage John's price:**  If Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can still buy the product from John at your maximum budget.

Rejecting this offer carries a small risk (Alice might not counter-offer), but it has the potential for a significant reward (getting the product for a lower price)."
