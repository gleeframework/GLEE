"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable addition to what you do, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm initially offering it for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I could do $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I see how valuable the product could be for you, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Could we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, which I appreciate.  $12,000 is close, but I need to get at least $14,000 for it. That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't quite meet that.  My absolute limit is $12,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,6,
