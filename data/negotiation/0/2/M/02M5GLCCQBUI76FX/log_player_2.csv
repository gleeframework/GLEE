"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high price.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price.  $1,000,000 from John is still a good option, but Bob should see if he can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob should start by offering the minimum he's willing to pay, which is the price John is selling for. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,750,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his baseline of $1,000,000. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left, giving him more opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

Bob should counter with a price that is higher than John's offer but lower than Alice's offer. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise but still wants a good deal. By offering $1,250,000, he is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also not willing to overpay. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above Bob's ideal price, and there are still 5 rounds left. Bob should keep negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000 or even lower. The risk of buying from John is still there, but Bob has the potential to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer but stay below Alice's current price. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better price. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward. If Alice continues to reject his offers, he can always go with John's offer."
