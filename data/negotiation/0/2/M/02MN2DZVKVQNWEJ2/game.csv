"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  $9,800 is still a little low for me, though.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,150?  I think that's a fair price that would work for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go one more round. How about $9,500? I think that's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
