,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to discuss the product further, but I can't go higher than $1000000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1750000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my interest in acquiring it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
