"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in your product, I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
