"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm confident it's worth far more than $1200000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is fair to both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
