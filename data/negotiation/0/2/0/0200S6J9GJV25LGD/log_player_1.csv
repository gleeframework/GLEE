Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly to see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  It's still a bit above my minimum price, but it demonstrates my willingness to be flexible."
