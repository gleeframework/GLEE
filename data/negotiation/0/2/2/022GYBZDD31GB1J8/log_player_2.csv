You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's, so continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room for improvement."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

While you could potentially continue negotiating, the price is now at $10,500. This is a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice at this point."
