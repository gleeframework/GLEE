Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for bargaining.  It's important to be confident but also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet at $825,000?  It's a good compromise and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $825,000 is a good outcome for me, considering the potential of selling to John for $800,000."
