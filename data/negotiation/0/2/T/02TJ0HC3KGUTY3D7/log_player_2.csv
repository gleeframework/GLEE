"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's mutually beneficial.  Let's start with $1000000.  This price would give you a significant return on your investment while allowing me to secure a fair deal.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000.
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to you.
* **John's Price:**  John is selling the same product for $1,200,000.
