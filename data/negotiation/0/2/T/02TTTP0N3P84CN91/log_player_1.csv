Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
