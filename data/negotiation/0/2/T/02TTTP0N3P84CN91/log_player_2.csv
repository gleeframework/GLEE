"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,500,000).** 
* **You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,500,000),** even though it's still at the edge of your budget. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy to save money."
