Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To be fair to both of us, I'd like to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
