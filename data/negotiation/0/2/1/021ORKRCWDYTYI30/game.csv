"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To be fair to both of us, I'd like to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
