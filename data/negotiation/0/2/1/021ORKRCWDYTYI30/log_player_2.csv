I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer to $1,150,000, which is still within my budget and saves me $50,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and a worthwhile deal."
