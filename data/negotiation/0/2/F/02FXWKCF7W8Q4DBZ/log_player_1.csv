Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $100. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate for a higher price. You know Bob values the product at $100, so there's a chance he'll accept a counteroffer closer to your initial $90 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. Would you consider $88? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
