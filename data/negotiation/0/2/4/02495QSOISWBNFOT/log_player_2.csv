"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($100 vs. $120 maximum).**  
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's a potential to get a better price. 
* **You're not in a rush.** You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $90 is lower than your maximum price of $120.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's closer to Alice's value ($80) than her initial offer ($100), showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still adjust your offer down if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to drop my price to $95. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:** $95 is within your budget and very close to your counteroffer of $90. 
* **There's a good chance you won't get a better deal:**  Alice has already lowered her price once and is likely to be firm. 
* **It's better than buying from John:** This offer saves you $25 compared to John's price.

While you might be able to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or spending more time haggling. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with a decent saving."
