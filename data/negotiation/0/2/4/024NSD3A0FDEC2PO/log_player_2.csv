"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic price, considering its true value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $11500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go to $11000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11800? This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
