"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,000,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
