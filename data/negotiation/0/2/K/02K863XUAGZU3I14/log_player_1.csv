Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.  
* **""Exclusive opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering Bob's willingness to pay and your secured alternative."
