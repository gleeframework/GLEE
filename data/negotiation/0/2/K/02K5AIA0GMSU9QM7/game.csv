"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay the full $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product offers significant potential beyond what you might be considering. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to accept $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Can you reconsider?",875000.0,Bob,6,
