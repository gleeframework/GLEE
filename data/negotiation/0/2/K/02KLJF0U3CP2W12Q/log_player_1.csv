"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to split the difference with Bob.  I'm confident that I can reach a deal with him at this price, and I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $800,000.  It's better to secure the $850,000 now."
