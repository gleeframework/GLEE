"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a good compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $105? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle.",105.0,Bob,4,
