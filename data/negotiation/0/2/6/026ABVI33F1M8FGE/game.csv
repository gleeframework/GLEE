"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's compromise at $95.  I'm confident that we can find common ground there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll meet you at $102.50. That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $98.75? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",98.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $98.75. I'll meet you at $101.25. That's the best I can do. If you're willing to go that high, I'm willing to make a deal.",101.25,Alice,7,
