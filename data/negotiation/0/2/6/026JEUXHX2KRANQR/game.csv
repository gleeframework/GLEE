"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, reflecting the potential we both see in this. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the opportunity it presents.  Let's make this work. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to offer $1150000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
