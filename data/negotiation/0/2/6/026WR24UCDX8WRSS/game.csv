"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500. However, I'm still a bit over budget.  How about $11,000? That's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
