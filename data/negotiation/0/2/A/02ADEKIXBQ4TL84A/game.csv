"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, a price that allows for a fair return for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's split the difference -  I'll accept $975,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this unique product. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer of $900,000. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
