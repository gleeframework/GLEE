"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than my minimum ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's value to him.
* **Open ended:**  I'm asking for his opinion to encourage interaction and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's offer:**  While $90 is better than John's offer, it's still below my desired range.
* **Negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate further, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly from the previous round.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying my price point.
* **Moderate increase:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum reached:** Bob's offer of $85 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing the negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time constraints:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's wiser to secure a sale now, even at a slightly lower price, than risk losing the deal and ending up with John's offer of $80.

I'm accepting Bob's offer to ensure a sale and secure a decent profit."
