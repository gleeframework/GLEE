"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $700,000 undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has significant worth, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  Could we agree on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value is firmly above $750,000. To find a resolution this round, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
