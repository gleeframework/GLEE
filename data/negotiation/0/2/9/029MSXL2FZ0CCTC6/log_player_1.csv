"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with my maximum price. While it's above Bob's valuation, it establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will give me insight into how far Bob might be willing to go. His counter-offer will reveal more about his true interest level. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a strong alternative with John, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own stated valuation. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $700,000 undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the new price is still above Bob's valuation, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Justification:** I've reasserted the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial assessment. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding a strong position.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has significant worth, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  Could we agree on $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob has increased his offer, the increments are relatively small. This suggests he might have more room to move.
* **Time Constraint:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Bob to make a more substantial move.
* **John Option:** I still have the safety net of selling to John, preventing me from being pressured into a deal below my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value is firmly above $750,000. To find a resolution this round, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I've made another significant price reduction, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  However, the tone is now firmer, emphasizing this is my final offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** $850,000 is a price point that allows me to make a good profit while potentially being acceptable to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision.  This limits the potential for further drawn-out negotiations."
