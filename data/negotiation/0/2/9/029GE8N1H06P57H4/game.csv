,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $9,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $8,250? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. ",8750.0,Alice,5,
