,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",15250.0,Bob,4,
