"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to stay close to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $975,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident that I can get a better offer if I continue to negotiate.  I need to get at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $987,500? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's getting closer, but I still need a price closer to $1,000,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to stay above $1 million. How about $1,012,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm getting close with Bob, we're running out of time, and it's unlikely that I'll be able to get him to agree to a price that's acceptable to me.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk losing out on a more profitable sale."
