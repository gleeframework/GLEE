Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  I need to make at least $8,000, so anything less than that is not profitable. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:**  I don't know what Bob values the product at, so there's a chance he'd be willing to pay more than my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a price slightly higher than my minimum ($9,000) provides a potential for a higher profit while still maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
