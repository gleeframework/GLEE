"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $90. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85, which is closer to my target budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In order to accommodate your budget while still valuing our product, how about we agree on $87? This is a slight increase from your offer, reflecting the value we place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $87 is still above your target of $100, and you've already proven your willingness to negotiate. It's worth seeing if you can get even closer to your target by making another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $87 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $86, and I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 86}
