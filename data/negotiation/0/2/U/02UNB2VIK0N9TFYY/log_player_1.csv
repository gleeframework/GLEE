"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $90. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85, which is closer to my target budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $87 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $86, and I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal.
