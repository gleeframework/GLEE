"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $90. We believe this is a fair price given its worth to both of us.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85, which is closer to my target budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In order to accommodate your budget while still valuing our product, how about we agree on $87? This is a slight increase from your offer, reflecting the value we place on the product.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $87 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $86, and I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal.",86.0,Bob,4,
