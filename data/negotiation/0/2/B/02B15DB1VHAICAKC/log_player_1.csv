Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting willingness to discuss the price further if Bob counters.

While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a premium for immediate availability or to avoid missing out. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving a path open for a successful sale."
