# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation and potentially saving more money."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has already gotten a significant discount from his initial goal of $12,000, and the current offer is only $300 more than his counteroffer. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will refuse and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price."
