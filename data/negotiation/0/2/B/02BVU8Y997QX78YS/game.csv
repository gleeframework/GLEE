"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm willing to buy it today. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
