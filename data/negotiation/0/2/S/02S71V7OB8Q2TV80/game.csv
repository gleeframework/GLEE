"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My budget for this product is $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 as a starting point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our initial offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $975,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and allows me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new price of $950,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your budget constraints.",950000.0,Alice,5,
