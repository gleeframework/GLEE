"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $850000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is closer to his budget, he can still likely negotiate a better price by counter-offering."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $800,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I see in your product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
