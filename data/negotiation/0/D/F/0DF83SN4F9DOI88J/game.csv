"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
