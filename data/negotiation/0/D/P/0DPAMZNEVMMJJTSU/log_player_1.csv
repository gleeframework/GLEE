Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at $80 for the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
