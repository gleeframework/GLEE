``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a strong offer for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $7,000 is too low for me. I understand you want a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation, and it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but I'm still a bit far off from my budget. Would you consider $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate.  I'd rather sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
