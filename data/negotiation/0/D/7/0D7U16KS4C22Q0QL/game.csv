"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be very valuable to you as well.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is just not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm offering it to you for $12,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is really a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
