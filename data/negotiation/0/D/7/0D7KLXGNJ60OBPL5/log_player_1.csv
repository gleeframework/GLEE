"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a significant price point that leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push for a higher offer from Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit margin for me. I believe this price is fair and might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial target price, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher. With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John ensures a solid profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
