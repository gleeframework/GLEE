"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation to avoid alienating Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $175 leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise. 

I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, giving me a chance to bargain and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range. If he doesn't, I'll have a few rounds to adjust my offer before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $130 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to sell for that price.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  Bob is interested, and his counteroffer indicates a willingness to negotiate.  This gives me a chance to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leave room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $130 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  $160 still leaves room for potential further negotiation, while ensuring I'm not giving away too much.

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer. If not, we can continue negotiating in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $140. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $150.  
* **Negotiation is Key:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a higher price. 

I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to $150 without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefit of accepting the offer.

I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a fair offer and accept, avoiding the need for further negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid further risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $142. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $142 is very close to my minimum of $150.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further concessions and potentially losing the deal altogether. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's time to minimize risk and secure the guaranteed profit from John."
