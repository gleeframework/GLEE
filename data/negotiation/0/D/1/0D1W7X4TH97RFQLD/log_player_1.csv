"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the product's value to Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is key for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show him I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum, so I'm still maximizing my potential earnings.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,250 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This is a good price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Even though we've been negotiating, I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000 for this product, which is still a great price considering its value to you.  Let's try to find common ground here, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a small concession by lowering the price, but still staying above Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:** I'm focusing on finding ""common ground"" to emphasize a win-win situation and potentially encourage Bob to make a final move.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Let's try $8,800. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and I need to be strategic about maximizing my earnings.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I continue to demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair price. I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $9,100, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
