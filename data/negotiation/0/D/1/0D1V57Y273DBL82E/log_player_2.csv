Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.
