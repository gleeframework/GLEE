,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider meeting me at $8,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $8,200 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $8,300, but that's my absolute final offer.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to close this deal.",8300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,300, which is $8,150. Can you consider that?",8150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not comfortable selling for $8,150.  My final offer is $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while. Let me know if you're ready to seal the deal.",8250.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8200.0,Bob,8,
