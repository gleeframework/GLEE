"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $17000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counteroffer at $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
