"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point, giving Bob a good deal while still leaving room for potential negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he is likely to be interested in this offer.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. It's worth risking another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see that he's getting a good deal at this price and will be willing to meet me halfway.  If not, we'll continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied with $10,500. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm raising the price just a bit, but not by much. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm also willing to compromise.  I'm hoping that he will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. I'm not quite ready to settle for that price just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This is a compromise offer, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and a strong possibility for Bob to accept.  If he rejects, we're getting close to the point where selling to John might become more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer has stalled at $10,000. While this is a decent price, it's still not quite where I'd like to be. I've already made several compromises and there's a risk of getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
