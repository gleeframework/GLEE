I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the price I was initially hoping for, it's still a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate.  With only a few rounds left, it's important to secure a sale, especially given that John is still an option if I need to."
