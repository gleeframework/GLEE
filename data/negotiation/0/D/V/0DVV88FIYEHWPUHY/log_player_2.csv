"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price, knowing that Alice values the product at $120, and hoping to quickly reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'll reject and try to negotiate further, as I have several rounds left and John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  It's still below Alice's likely minimum, but shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages her to counter closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my ideal price, I still have rounds remaining. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down to $105 or a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go much higher. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to accept or make a counteroffer that's within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Alice's offer of $112 is still higher than my ideal price, and it's unlikely she will come down further.  It's better to secure the product from John for my maximum budget of $100 rather than risk running out of time and having to pay more."
