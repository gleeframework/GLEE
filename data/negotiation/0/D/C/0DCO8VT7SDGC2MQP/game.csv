"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
