Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount of money for me while still leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario with Bob.  I want to try and capture as much of the value as possible, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still lower than my ideal price point. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can get closer to $1,000,000. I believe that by making a counteroffer, I can still reach a price that's profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $975,000.  While I'd prefer to get even closer to $1,000,000,  I'm going to accept his offer.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether and I'm confident I can still earn a good profit with this price."
