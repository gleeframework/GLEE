I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $150.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
That price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?,80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I think we can find a sweet spot at $110. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,
