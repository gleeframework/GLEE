"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach allows for a potential win-win scenario and gives Bob an incentive to counter. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm choosing to reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a more advantageous price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This price reflects the product's true value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,250?  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to finalize this transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still far too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can still reach a more favorable deal.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,750. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob's final offer of $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have only two rounds left and there's no guarantee that I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000."
