{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $20,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible.  Starting with a lower offer of $13,000 allows room for negotiation. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and could entice her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $18,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $15,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation, as Bob might be able to secure a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his ideal price while keeping some room for negotiation. $14,500 is still lower than Alice's offer and could potentially tempt her to accept. It also gives Bob some wiggle room if Alice decides to counter again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but at this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $15,000. This guarantees a deal within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation rounds."
