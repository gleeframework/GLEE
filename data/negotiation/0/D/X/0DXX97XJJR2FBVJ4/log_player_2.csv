"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's fair to both of us.  I believe it's worth $1,200,000, considering its potential value to you. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price and might incentivize Alice to lower her asking price further."
