Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000.
* This is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,250,000, and a good deal for you.
*  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
