Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay slightly less, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""deal"" aspect to make the offer more enticing to Bob."
