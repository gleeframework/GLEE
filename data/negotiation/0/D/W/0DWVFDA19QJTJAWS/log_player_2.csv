"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for something worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget. I want to save money, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm also being polite and respectful to keep the conversation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $10,500, which is still slightly above my target price of $10,000.  However, John is offering the product for $10,000, so I have a safety net.  I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price, keeping in mind that I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully push us closer to a deal."
