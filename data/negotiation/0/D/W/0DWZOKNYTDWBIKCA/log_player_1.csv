Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $150 is significantly higher than my minimum, but not exorbitantly high that it would immediately scare Bob away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still allowing me to potentially secure a price higher than $100."
