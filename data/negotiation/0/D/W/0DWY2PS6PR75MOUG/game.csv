"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product will bring you significant returns on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire a game-changing product, and I believe it's worth the investment.
