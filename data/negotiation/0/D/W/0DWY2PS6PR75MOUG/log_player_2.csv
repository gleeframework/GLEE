Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product will bring you significant returns on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter again and see if we can close the gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire a game-changing product, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm comfortable with. It's getting close, but I'm not sure we'll be able to close the deal with her at this rate.  I'd rather just buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
