Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $150? I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 175}
