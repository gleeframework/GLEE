"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's minimum as possible.  A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This should encourage Alice to consider the offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than the $10,500 he offered. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and he can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's current offer. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but is also trying to get the best possible price. $10,750 is a reasonable compromise that could be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, Bob should still reject it.  He's already made several counteroffers and is getting closer to his goal. It's worth trying to see if Alice will budge further.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been gradually increasing his offer while also staying below Alice's offers.  Now, he is getting closer to Alice's perceived value, but still has some room to negotiate. This offer is a good compromise, and Alice may be willing to accept it, especially considering the number of rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's goal is to save money, but the rounds are dwindling. Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum price, and it's possible that Alice will not budge further.  It's also possible that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice will continue to make counteroffers that are higher than Bob's desired price. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $11,800 is the best option. Bob gets the product for a price that is slightly above his minimum but still lower than John's price.  It's a small compromise to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
