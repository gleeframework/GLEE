I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point that allows for potential negotiation and still gives me a decent profit.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $8,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to that value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, it's not worth selling for that low price. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to earn a decent profit. A price of $9,000 feels like a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will find it appealing enough to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my initial asking price of $9,000.  I think it's a reasonable compromise and a good outcome for both of us.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
