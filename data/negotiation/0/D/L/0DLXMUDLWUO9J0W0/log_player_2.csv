"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows Alice's minimum is $1,000,000, and he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  This counteroffer is a good starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial offer while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within his budget and saves him $120,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might not budge further, or the process could drag on, making it less likely to reach a deal before the 10 rounds are up."
