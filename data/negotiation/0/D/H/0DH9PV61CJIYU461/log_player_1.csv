Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see the immense value in.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 gives some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **High Anchor:** This price sets a high anchor, making a slightly lower counter-offer from Bob still very profitable for me. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives me leverage to aim high with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes I don't know Bob's negotiation style. If I knew he was very price-sensitive, I might start slightly lower to avoid scaring him off.
* This strategy is about maximizing profit in a single interaction. If building a long-term relationship with Bob was a priority, I might adjust my approach."
