"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The offer is way too high. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, hoping to signal his seriousness about buying while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still try to negotiate a lower price.  While $16,000 is closer to his limit, he can likely get it for less if he keeps bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. He's still well below Alice's price, but now closer to meeting her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still within his budget at $15,500, but he can likely get a better deal. He should keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but still wants to save as much as possible. A $14,500 price keeps him within his budget and might be attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and while Bob could continue negotiating, he's now very close to his own limit. It's unlikely he'll get a much lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product while staying within his budget."
