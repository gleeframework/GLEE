"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a great value for the product's features and benefits.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and pay $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of $1000000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
