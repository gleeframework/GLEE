Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?"",

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're getting close, but I still think we can get a bit closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $960,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a bit more, accepting at $960,000 is a strong return and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's always better to secure a good deal than to hold out for an ideal deal and risk losing it all."
