"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1000000.  This gives you a significant return on your investment and ensures I get a fair price for the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can still purchase the product from John for the same price as he'd pay Alice. This gives Bob the opportunity to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or find another seller."
