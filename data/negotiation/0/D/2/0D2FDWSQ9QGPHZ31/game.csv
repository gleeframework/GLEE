"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1000000.  This gives you a significant return on your investment and ensures I get a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
