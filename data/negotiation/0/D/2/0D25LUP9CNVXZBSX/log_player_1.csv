Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000,  it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $850,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above his perceived value.  

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but there's also a chance he might accept it, netting me a higher profit than selling to John."
