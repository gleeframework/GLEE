"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about we start with $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for you. Let's see if we can close the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11500 is still outside my budget. How about we meet at $11250?  That's a small increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,6,
