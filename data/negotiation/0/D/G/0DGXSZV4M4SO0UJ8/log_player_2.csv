"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  I'm willing to negotiate, and I have a backup option with John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about we start with $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point, knowing that I have the John option as a safety net if Alice isn't willing to negotiate. This counteroffer gives Alice room to come down a bit, while also showing her that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for you. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price before considering buying from John.  I'm confident I can get Alice lower, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but staying below my maximum.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.  I'm also highlighting the ""split the difference"" strategy, which can be a good way to close a deal when both parties are close to agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high. I'm going to try to get her down a bit more, but with only a few rounds left, I need to be careful not to risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still outside my budget. How about we meet at $11,250?  That's a small increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but staying below my maximum. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I have a limit.  I'm also highlighting the ""compromise"" aspect, which can be a good way to make a final offer. I'm approaching the end of the rounds, so I want to show Alice that I'm serious but not desperate."
