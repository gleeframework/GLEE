Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $135 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $150.  

This strategy aims to find the sweet spot between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing the potential profit."
