"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but still within a range that Bob might consider given he values it at $80. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and positioning the offer as a ""great deal"". 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, indicating I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to consider it worthwhile. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I can likely secure a higher price than $90. 
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for a price that is closer to my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $90. It's closer to what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $105. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that meets my minimum.
* **Finality:** I'm stating this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer for both of us, making it more appealing for Bob to agree.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John. I'll assess the situation based on the remaining rounds and the likelihood of securing a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90 to $100. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $100 exactly meets my minimum price requirement. 
* **No room for improvement:** While I might prefer a higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge further. 
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing this deal and potentially ending up with nothing if I continue to counteroffer.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale at my minimum price, maximizing my earnings within the given time constraints."
