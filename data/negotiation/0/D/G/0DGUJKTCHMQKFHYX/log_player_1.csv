``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also acknowledging that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me some leverage. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for $18,000 just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's more than my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to budge a little more before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $18500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still keeping my budget in check. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $18,500 is close enough to my minimum price of $15,000 and significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000.  It's in my best interest to accept and secure the sale."
