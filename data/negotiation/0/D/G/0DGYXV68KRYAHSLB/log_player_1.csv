Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness to buy and gives you a sense of how flexible he might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $150 is my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit. Would you consider $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a margin above John's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while aiming for a more profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is now at $120. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more, it's getting riskier. Accepting $120 guarantees a profit of $20 over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
