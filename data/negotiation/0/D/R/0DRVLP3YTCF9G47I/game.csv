"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in it while giving you a fair return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,875,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,875,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
