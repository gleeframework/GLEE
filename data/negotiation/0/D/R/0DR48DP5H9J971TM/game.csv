"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a little too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the product from someone else for $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
