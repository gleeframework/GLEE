This is a special opportunity to own a piece that could significantly enhance your [specific context], whether it's improving efficiency, increasing productivity, or simply adding a touch of luxury to your life.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aiming high with her initial offer. She's trying to anchor you to the idea of a $15,000 value, even though you've set a mental limit of $15,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high.  This opens the door for negotiation. 
* You have a backup option (John) at $15,000, so you're not desperate to accept Alice's first offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you're hoping Alice will come back with a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value. You can then negotiate further or accept if it's a good deal."
