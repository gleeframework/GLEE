Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in your product's value.

By opening with a strong offer, you set the tone for the negotiation. You're also showing Bob that you're willing to compromise, which can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see $925,000 to make this work.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $875,000 is still a good deal and significantly higher than what I could get from John.  It's important to be pragmatic and recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome."
