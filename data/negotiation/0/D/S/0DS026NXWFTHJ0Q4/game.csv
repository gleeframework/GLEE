"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 as a final compromise.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
