Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring you'd make a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  The message hints at other buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. A lot depends on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality and willingness to pay."
