"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, so I'm not losing anything by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  I'll reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my ideal value, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to go much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my ideal price. It's only $500 below my initial offer and still significantly higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer will allow me to get a good price while also avoiding further negotiation rounds."
