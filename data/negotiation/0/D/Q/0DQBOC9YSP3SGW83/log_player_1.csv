Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  Starting with enthusiasm and highlighting the product's value sets a positive tone.
* **High anchor:** By starting at your true value ($10,000), you establish a strong initial point. While Bob might try to negotiate down, this leaves you room to potentially settle for a price higher than his perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Confident justification:**  Phrasing the price as reflecting the product's ""true worth"" positions it as non-negotiable, but you can afford to be flexible since you have John as a backup buyer.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, given the information, it's strategically sound to start high. If Bob does reject the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
