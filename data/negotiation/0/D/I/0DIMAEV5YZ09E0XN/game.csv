"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $12,500, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider selling it to John for $12,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
