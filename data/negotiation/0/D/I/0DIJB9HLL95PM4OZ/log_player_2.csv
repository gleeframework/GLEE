# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value and potential of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer demonstrates my commitment to making this work.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still too high for Bob. He can still try to negotiate a lower price and has the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."
