Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I'm eager to invest in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While $1,600,000 reflects the true value and potential of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement.

Explanation:

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($1,200,000).  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better price, and it introduces risk.  It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
