"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident this product has a lot of potential, and I'm eager to invest in it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value and potential of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer demonstrates my commitment to making this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's aim for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
