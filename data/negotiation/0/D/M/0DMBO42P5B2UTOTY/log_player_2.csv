Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above your budget.  It's not guaranteed that further negotiation will lead to a price you're comfortable with. Since you can get the product for $100 from John, it's more efficient to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase the product from John."
