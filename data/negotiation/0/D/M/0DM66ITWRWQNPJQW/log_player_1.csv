Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. This allows for some room to negotiate and gives Bob an incentive to accept, while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $65 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
