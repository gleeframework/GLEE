I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($80), giving me room for potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation,  I'm taking a calculated risk. If he rejects, I'm guaranteed to sell to John for $80, so I'm not losing anything. However, there's a chance Bob will find the price attractive and buy, earning me $20 more."
