The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

``` 

This is a crucial round.  Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price to $120 in the final round.  Therefore, it's better to buy from John to guarantee the purchase at his price."
