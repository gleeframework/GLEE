,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for you too. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97.  I'm still looking for a bit more, though. How about $101? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's just a small step closer to where we need to be. What do you say?",101.0,Alice,5,
