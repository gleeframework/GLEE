Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for you too. Let me know if you're interested.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97.  I'm still looking for a bit more, though. How about $101? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's just a small step closer to where we need to be. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  At this point, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed deal with John for $100.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when a better option is readily available."
