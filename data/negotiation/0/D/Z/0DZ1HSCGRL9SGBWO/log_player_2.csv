{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in my best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear lower limit for my acceptable price range.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point considering my budget and the potential for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to spend more than $1,200,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm not willing to spend more than $1,200,000. However, with only five rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure. I will continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price but keeping the option to buy from John as a safety net."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is my final offer. I'm going all-in with my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'm hoping that Alice will finally accept, as she's shown a willingness to compromise.
