{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $130 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a great price considering the value to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $115, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum value of $120. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, so I'll choose to sell to him."
