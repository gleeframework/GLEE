"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $650,000, which would be $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Could we try for $750,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I'll meet you halfway between $925,000 and $750,000, which would be $837,500. I think that's a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",837500.0,Alice,5,
