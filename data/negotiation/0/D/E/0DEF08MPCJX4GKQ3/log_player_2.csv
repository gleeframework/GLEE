"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more competitive price, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $650,000, which would be $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget.  Could we try for $750,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. I'll meet you halfway between $925,000 and $750,000, which would be $837,500. I think that's a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's using a tactic of halving the difference.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get her much lower than $800,000 within the remaining rounds. John's offer is guaranteed and saves us the hassle of further negotiation."
