"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $950000 is my maximum offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Is there any flexibility on your end?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, like you suggested, so I'll make a new offer of $975000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I think we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to make sure I'm getting the value I deserve for this product. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,,
