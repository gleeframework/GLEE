"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,200,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $800,000 to see if we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet the price of $1,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this revised counteroffer is within your consideration.",900000.0,Bob,4,
