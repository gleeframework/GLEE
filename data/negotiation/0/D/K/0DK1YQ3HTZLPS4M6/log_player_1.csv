Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee my minimum price, but I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $1,150,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment while giving you a good deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Can you consider $1120000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum. Selling to John at this point would guarantee my minimum price, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution.  $1,120,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off my target.  Let's try $1,130,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1130000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1140000? I'm getting close to my target, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,140,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to consider that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a profit.  Selling to John at this point would only yield the same amount, and further negotiation with Bob might not result in a better outcome."
