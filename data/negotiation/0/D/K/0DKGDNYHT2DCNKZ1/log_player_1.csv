Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1,500,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price that's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in negotiation. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Know Your Product:** I'm assuming this product is truly unique and potentially valuable to Bob, as this is the foundation for asking a high price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob go poorly, I can always fall back to John's offer. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** My future actions will depend on Bob's response. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Bob's interest in the product is evident, but his offer is unreasonable. I have room to negotiate and can try to reach a more acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to selling the product for a fair value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still allow me to cover my costs and ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing justification for the price, emphasizing my costs and fairness. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message frames the counteroffer as a way to find a deal that benefits both parties. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Again, I'm ending with an invitation to further discussion, signaling my willingness to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  The success of this counteroffer hinges on Bob's reaction.  If he's willing to meet me halfway, we might reach an agreement. 
* **Prepare for More Counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has come up from his previous offer, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Value:** Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me, and I'm not willing to compromise that much.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential for a mutually beneficial deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make another counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Assessing John's Offer:** If negotiations continue to stall, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer as a safe alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and its value goes beyond just a number. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need to stay at $1,100,000. It's the best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for myself.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

* **Finality:** The message implies this might be my final offer, adding pressure for Bob to consider accepting.
* **Focusing on Agreement:** I'm framing the price as a point of agreement, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that this product might not be as valuable to me as I initially thought, and I'm getting close to just buying it from John for $1000000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob's comment about buying from John for $1,000,000 signals that he's unlikely to budge further.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely lead to further concessions and a lower price.
* **John's Offer is the Best Option:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, John's offer provides me with a secure and profitable outcome."
