Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I don't want to settle for less.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me closer to my initial goal. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $1,900,000, $1,850,000 is still a good price.  I'm not sure if I can push him any higher, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  I'll take the $1,850,000 and call it a day."
