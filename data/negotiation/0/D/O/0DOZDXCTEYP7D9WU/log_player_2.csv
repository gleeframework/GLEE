Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already had several rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $80 and avoid further haggling."
