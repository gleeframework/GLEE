"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Set a high anchor point that might influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to this initial offer to understand his negotiation style and how close he might be willing to go to his $1,200,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for you. While selling to John is a tempting guaranteed outcome, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know if this revised proposal aligns better with your valuation."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While a significant decrease from the initial offer, coming down to $1,800,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's inherent value and potential, aiming to justify the high price point. 
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This counteroffer aims to test Bob's flexibility. If he's completely unwilling to budge from $1,200,000, it might be time to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but my budget is firm at $1,200,000. I'm happy to continue discussing this, but I'm not going to go any higher.  If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,200,000 is his absolute limit. He's reiterated this twice now and is signaling that he's ready to walk away.  Further negotiation with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a substantial profit and meets your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
