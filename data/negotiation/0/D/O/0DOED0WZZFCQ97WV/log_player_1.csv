"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,800,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counter-offers are likely to be influenced by this initial high number.
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message is positive and confident, conveying the product's value and suggesting that a deal is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. After evaluating its value, I believe a fair price would be closer to $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, we still have room to negotiate. It's clear he's interested and values the product. We started high, and he countered with a significant jump down, but it's still above our minimum.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to adjust my price somewhat, but $1,500,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product. "",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We're showing Bob we're willing to negotiate by coming down $150,000 from our initial offer.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing $1,650,000 positions our counter-offer as a fair compromise, encouraging Bob to move closer to our desired price range.
* **Reaffirming Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's unique value to justify a price significantly above Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and believe that a fair price for the product would be $1,600,000. I hope this suggestion helps us reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product, and his offer of $1,600,000 is a strong one.  While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the difference is likely to be relatively small. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or time running out."
