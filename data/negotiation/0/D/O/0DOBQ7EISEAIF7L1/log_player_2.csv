"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to $1,000,000, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

This is a good price and Alice seems firm on her bottom line. It's better to accept a good deal than risk losing it."
