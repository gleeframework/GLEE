"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to $1,000,000, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
