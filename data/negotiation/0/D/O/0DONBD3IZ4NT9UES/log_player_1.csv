Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This price is still a great deal for you, considering how much the product is worth to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,500 is a good price and it's getting closer to my ideal. It's better than the $8,000 I would get from John. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by pushing too hard."
