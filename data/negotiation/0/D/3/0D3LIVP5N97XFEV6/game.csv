"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm happy to work with you, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference. How about $1,175,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
