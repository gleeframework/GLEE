# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Getting close to your limit:**  While you could try to haggle further, $1,075,000 is already pushing the boundaries of what you're willing to pay. 
* **Alice is firm:** She's stated this is her final offer twice.  There's a good chance she won't budge, and you could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Saving compared to John:** You're still saving a significant amount ($425,000) compared to buying from John.

It's always tempting to try to get the absolute lowest price, but sometimes a good deal requires knowing when to accept."
