"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her perceived value, you can get a better deal from John for $8,000."
