"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) provides room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""potential"" of the product helps justify the initial high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Explicitly stating your willingness to negotiate signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but you might be able to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, my original asking price reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price represents a significant compromise and hope it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Compromise:**  By significantly decreasing your price from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob why the price is justified, even at a lower point. 
* **Aim for Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a price point between your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and you risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential risk of continuing the negotiation."
