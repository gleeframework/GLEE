"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds to work with and knows the product is worth less to Alice. There's no reason to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $9,500, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $2,500 from John's price.  With more rounds remaining, Bob can risk negotiating further, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge more, and the risk of losing the deal to another seller is increasing. It's a good compromise."
