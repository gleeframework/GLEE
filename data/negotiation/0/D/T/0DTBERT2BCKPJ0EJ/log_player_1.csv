Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. Unfortunately, I am still unable to meet at $130. I would like to stick to my original budget of $80 if possible. Would you consider coming down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $90, which is closer to my original budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored to his $80 budget.  It's unlikely he'll come close to your $110 final offer within the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
