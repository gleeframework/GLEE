"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? This is my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
