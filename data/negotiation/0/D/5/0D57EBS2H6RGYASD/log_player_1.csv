Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions or counteroffers."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I potentially make a good profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob, which might encourage him to engage in a counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's potential, hoping to pique Bob's interest and make him consider its value. 
* **Plan B:** The existence of John as a backup buyer is crucial. This allows me to end negotiations if they're not yielding a satisfactory outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction:** Depending on his response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he counteroffers, I'll carefully evaluate the price and consider my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Consider John's offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, I'll switch to John to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum budget of $800000, I'm willing to offer $600000 for this product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering my budget constraints and the potential value you've described. I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's budget is lower than my initial price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm not immediately selling to John because there's potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob.
* **Counter-offering:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap between our expectations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Consider John:** If negotiations with Bob become unproductive, I'll switch to John to ensure I get my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows you a significant margin for potential profit. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer bridges the gap between my initial price ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($600,000). It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the $1,000,000 price point.
* **Win-win scenario:** I highlight the potential for profit for Bob, emphasizing that this price allows him to potentially make a good return on his investment.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction:** I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, I've achieved my minimum value. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **John remains an option:** John's offer of $1,000,000 remains a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to offer $750000. This is closer to my budget, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Selling at this price would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible, but getting closer to John's offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. However, I'm starting to get closer to John's offer, making me consider selling to him. 
* **Counter-offering one more time:**  Before potentially selling to John, I'll make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Final counteroffer:**  I'll make a final counteroffer, closer to my minimum but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll be very clear that this is my final offer.
* **Weighing John's offer:** If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I'll strongly consider selling to John. He offers a guaranteed minimum value, eliminating the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer, and while I appreciate your persistence,  $750,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. My absolute final offer is $900,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a healthy margin for you. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you are not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer who has already expressed interest at my minimum asking price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer is clear and firm, leaving no room for further negotiation.  
* **Close to my minimum:** The price of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value than Bob's last offer, making it a more attractive option for me. 
* **Emphasizing the value and risk:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the price and the potential for Bob to lose out on a valuable opportunity if he rejects this final offer. 
* **John's offer is in the background:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have another buyer lined up at a price closer to my final offer, making it more likely he'll accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Final decision:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll have achieved a profitable sale.
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I'll move forward with selling the product to John to secure my minimum value. This ensures I'm not leaving any money on the table."
