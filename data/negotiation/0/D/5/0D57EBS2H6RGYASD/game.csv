"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions or counteroffers.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum budget of $800000, I'm willing to offer $600000 for this product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering my budget constraints and the potential value you've described. I'm open to negotiating further.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $600000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1000000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows you a significant margin for potential profit. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to offer $750000. This is closer to my budget, and I believe it's still a good deal considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer, and while I appreciate your persistence,  $750000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. My absolute final offer is $900000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a healthy margin for you. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you are not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer who has already expressed interest at my minimum asking price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
