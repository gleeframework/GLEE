"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product.  While I agree it has potential, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find some middle ground. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, splitting the difference sounds fair in principle, but we're still a ways off. I could potentially go up to $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer. To be frank, I have another offer I need to consider, but I'd rather make this work with you.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  My final offer is $1,350,000. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
