"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves some room for both of us to profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
