"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more attractive. Alice knows you have John as a backup option, so she might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
