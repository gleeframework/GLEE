"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $90. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $85. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $85 is very close, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we possibly settle at $75?  That's really the most I can do.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",80.0,Alice,7,
