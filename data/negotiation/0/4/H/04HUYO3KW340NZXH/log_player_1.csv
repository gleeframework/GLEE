Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and might discourage excessive haggling.

**Important:**  This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit. However, there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer, leading you to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
