Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant step, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding common ground.  I've carefully considered your latest offer.
