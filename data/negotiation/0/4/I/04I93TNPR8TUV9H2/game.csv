"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant step, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to consider $2,100,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding common ground.  I've carefully considered your latest offer. To be completely transparent, $1,900,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. However, I value our developing business relationship and I'm willing to make a final offer - $2,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is a firm offer. I believe it's a fair deal that reflects the product's true worth.",2050000.0,Alice,5,

I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
