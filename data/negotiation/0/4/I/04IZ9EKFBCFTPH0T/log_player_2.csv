"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can buy the product from John for $150, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting and counteroffering in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $120?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a lower price. 
* **Realistic but not insulting:** $120 is a substantial reduction, but still leaves room for negotiation and avoids making Alice feel like I'm disrespecting her offer.
* **Open to further discussion:** I end with a question to keep the conversation going and allow for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135. This still gives me some wiggle room while hopefully being more appealing to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. It's worth seeing if she'll budge further. Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? I'm really looking to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Acknowledging Alice's compromise keeps the negotiation positive and shows I'm willing to work with her.
* **Small but significant reduction:**  $130 is a smaller step down from $135, suggesting a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning closing the deal today adds a bit of pressure, potentially encouraging Alice to accept."
