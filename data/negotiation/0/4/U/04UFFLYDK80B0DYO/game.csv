"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still a bit higher than $850,000.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
