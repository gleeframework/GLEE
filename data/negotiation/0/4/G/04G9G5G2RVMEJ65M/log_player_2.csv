Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a price of $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to budge, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.

We've gotten Alice down to $11,200 before, so going back up to $11,500 is a bad sign. Let's keep pushing for a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're at a bit of an impasse.  To be honest, if we can't agree on $11,000, I might have to explore other options. I'd really prefer to work with you, but I have a budget I need to stick to."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $11,000, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. Let's meet at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $11,250, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize savings before we're forced to buy from John."
