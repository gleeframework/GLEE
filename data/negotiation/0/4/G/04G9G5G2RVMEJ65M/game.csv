"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. How about we settle at $10,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a price of $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience.  I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $11,000? That's the best I can do.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to budge, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I can offer you a price of $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're at a bit of an impasse.  To be honest, if we can't agree on $11,000, I might have to explore other options. I'd really prefer to work with you, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $11,000, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. Let's meet at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,9,
