"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,800. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,4,
