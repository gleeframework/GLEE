# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, but I need to let you know that it's a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?

(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000. That's way above my budget. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000.
