"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a concession. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
