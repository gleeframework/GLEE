Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a concession. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
