Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning a public listing, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't sound like an ultimatum. This allows Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for further discussion."
