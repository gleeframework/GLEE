``` 

This offer starts at a price that's attractive to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find value in the product, and this price point leaves him room to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your enthusiasm for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. That's my absolute maximum, and I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

While $11,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum target. I'm willing to take a small risk and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer one more time."
