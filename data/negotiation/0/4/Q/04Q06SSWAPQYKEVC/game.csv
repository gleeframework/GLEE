"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your enthusiasm for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. That's my absolute maximum, and I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $11,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
