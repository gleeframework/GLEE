"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than that, but Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for both of them to gain by finding a price between $1,000,000 (Alice's minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between Alice's minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) minus a little bit, to leave room for Alice to negotiate.  This is a good starting point for the counteroffer, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is better than Bob's maximum price from John ($1,200,000).  It's also close enough to Bob's initial counteroffer that it's likely Alice won't budge much further. There's not much more room to negotiate, so it's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
