"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1700000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1550000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1600000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1525000. Can we meet at this price?",1525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1525000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial price point.  My final offer is $1575000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $1575000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to go up to $1525000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
