"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Establishing value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I clearly state my willingness to negotiate, fostering a collaborative tone. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I'm aiming for a higher price with Bob, I'm aware of John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. Accepting would leave me with no profit and wouldn't be worth the effort of the negotiation.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I have 9 rounds left and can try to increase the price. It's worth exploring if a better deal is possible.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, John's offer provides a secure fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still allows for a healthy margin for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the product's potential and how this price still offers a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging further discussion. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,250,000 is my preferred price, I'm still open to further adjustments depending on Bob's response."
