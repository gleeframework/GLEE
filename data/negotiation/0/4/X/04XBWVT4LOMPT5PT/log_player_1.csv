"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start strong but leave room to adjust based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $105 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back-and-forth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value of the product, how about $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are getting close to my minimum price, but we are also approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.  Considering that I can sell to John for $150, I'm going to take the guaranteed higher price and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
