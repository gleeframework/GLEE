Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob might counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still secure a price above my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his offer but closer to his range. This shows that I'm open to negotiation, but I still value the product significantly higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in further negotiation, as I'm happy to sell to him at this price."
