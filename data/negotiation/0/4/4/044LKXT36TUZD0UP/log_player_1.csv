Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price, while still leaving the door open for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do slightly better. I will try to counter-offer and see if I can get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
