{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The offer from Bob in round 6 is $13,300. This is slightly less than the last counteroffer, and getting closer to the minimum Alice is willing to accept. Since it is round 6, it is getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice needs to decide whether it is worth pushing further.  There is a risk that Bob will walk away or that the offer will continue to decrease in later rounds, and at this point, it is better to accept the offer and make a profit than to continue the negotiation."
