Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe the product is worth it. If Bob rejects, we can then negotiate down.  If he accepts, I've maximized my profit.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John for $800,000, so I'm not under any pressure to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $600,000, as my floor is $800,000.  While I could sell to John now for $800,000, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $900,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial price but still leaves room for some negotiation. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is very close to my floor of $800,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a good price, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating. It's also worth noting that this deal is more profitable than selling to John for $800,000."
