Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate,  making him feel like he's getting a better deal if he can get you to lower the price slightly. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might reject it outright. You have a strong fallback option with John, so you can be firm on your price."
