Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $950,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim high.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that benefits both of you."
