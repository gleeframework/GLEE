{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and aims to quickly find a middle ground. I believe this counteroffer is still within a reasonable range given Alice's value for the product and my own budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, there's still a gap. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. I'm raising my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway while still aiming to achieve a price within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is within my acceptable range, and it's only slightly higher than my last counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might take longer and might not result in a significantly better price. It's better to accept the offer and close the deal."
