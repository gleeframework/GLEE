"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? I believe this price still offers you great value, and it's closer to my desired range.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
