Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I believe this price still offers you great value, and it's closer to my desired range."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
