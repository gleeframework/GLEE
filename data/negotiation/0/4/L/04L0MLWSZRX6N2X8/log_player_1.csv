Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to get Bob to accept a price significantly higher than his perceived value, maximizing Alice's profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with selling to John at her desired price."
