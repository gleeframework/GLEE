Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $795,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $795,000.  While she knows your value is $800,000, she's trying to maximize her profit. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a potential savings of $5,000, especially when you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000."
