"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $760,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $795,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",795000.0,Alice,5,
