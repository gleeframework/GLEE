"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85. Although it's closer to my minimum value, I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating, I risk losing Bob as a buyer and being forced to sell to John for $80.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further risk."
