,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In order to reach a compromise, I am willing to lower the price to $90. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your patience and for suggesting $87.5. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Considering the value of the product and our costs, I'm willing to agree on $88. This price allows us to cover our expenses while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal works for you.",88.0,Alice,5,
