,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130.  If you're not willing to accept that, I might have to go with another option.",130.0,Bob,4,
