"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value of this product, $1200000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value of similar products.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1000000. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a stretch for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go higher than $850000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and my financial constraints.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer a price of $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad to see we're making progress.  While I'm serious about buying this product, $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a price of $975000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
