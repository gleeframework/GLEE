Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1000000. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us.
