"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. While I'm very interested in this product, $1025000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
