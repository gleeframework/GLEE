"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $127? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",127.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $127 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $129. This way we both get a fair deal and I can sell the product.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $126? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits.",126.0,Bob,6,
