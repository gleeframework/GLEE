Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I think it could be very valuable for you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
