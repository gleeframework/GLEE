Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, I'm looking for something closer to $120.  It's a fantastic product and I'm confident it's worth that price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.**  While it's lower than her original offer, you're still looking to save more.
* **You can likely still negotiate a lower price.** There's room for compromise, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Buying from John is still a viable option, but you're aiming for the best deal.**  You might be able to get a better price from Alice."
