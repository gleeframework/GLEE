"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $14,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000. I'm trying to make a profit, and $17,000 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure $15,500 is enough to cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16,250 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $16,250 is still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to offer you $15,250. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my spending limits.",15250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $16,000. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
