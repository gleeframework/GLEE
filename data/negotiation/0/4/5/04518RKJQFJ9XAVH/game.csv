"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I have to consider my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
