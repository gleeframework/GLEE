"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
