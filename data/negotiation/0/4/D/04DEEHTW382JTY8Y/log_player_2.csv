"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, so I will reject Alice's offer and buy it from John.
