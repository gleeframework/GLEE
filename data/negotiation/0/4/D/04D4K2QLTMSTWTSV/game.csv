"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 for the product. This still leaves a good deal of profit for you, as you value the product at $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still below the value you place on the product.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
