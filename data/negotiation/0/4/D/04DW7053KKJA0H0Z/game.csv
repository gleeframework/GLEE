"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get to $12,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
