Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while remaining open to discussion and not appearing overly aggressive.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts the initial offer or negotiates down slightly, you secure a significant profit. If he rejects it, you have the safety net of selling to John at your minimum price."
