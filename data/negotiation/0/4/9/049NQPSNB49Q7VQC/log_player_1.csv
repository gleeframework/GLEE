Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. It's a great deal for something of this quality, let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your minimum acceptable price ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down a bit, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  By implying it's a limited-time deal (""a steal""), you encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have John as a backup buyer, you're not at risk of selling below your minimum price."
