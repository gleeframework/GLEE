Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. 
* **Bob's Value:**  I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price above that, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
* **My Floor:**  My absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, as I can sell it to John for that amount. 
* **Negotiation Buffer:** Offering $1,200,000 gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my target price and leaves me with a lower profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have the upper hand in this negotiation because I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm going to counter Bob's offer to see if I can nudge him closer to my desired price. It's worth taking a chance to see if I can get a better price before I accept his offer or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $950,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value it holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Value Argument:** I'm emphasizing the value the product provides to Bob to justify the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go up to $1,100,000.
* **Balancing Risk:** While I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000 right now, I'm not immediately resorting to selling to John either. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this offers a compromise that satisfies both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my target price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Profitable Outcome:** Selling at $1,050,000 still yields a significant profit and is a good compromise considering the potential for further negotiation to break down.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome.  

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice to secure a good profit while minimizing risk."
