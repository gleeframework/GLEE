"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to potentially lower the price if he counters.  If he rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer of my own.  I'm always aware of the $1,500,000 offer from John, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. If Bob accepts, I'll secure a good deal. If he rejects, I'll see his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,750,000 is not bad, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,850,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still hoping to get a bit more. If Bob accepts, I'll secure a solid deal. If he rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,725,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for more. I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to $1,800,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my previous offer and see if Bob is willing to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is the price Bob offered before and represents a good compromise for both of us. If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. While $1,700,000 is a decent price, it's not enough to justify risking another round of negotiation and potentially another rejection.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This is the guaranteed sale and ensures I get at least the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
