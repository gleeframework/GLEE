{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price. This lets Bob know my value for the product and sets a baseline for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer Bob to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 135}
