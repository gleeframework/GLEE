"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that to me.  Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500, as I know the product is valuable to you.  This price would still be more than my minimum. Let me know if you're able to meet me in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? ",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
