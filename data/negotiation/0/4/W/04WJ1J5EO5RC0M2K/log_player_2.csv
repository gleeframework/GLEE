"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.

It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer when you can get the product for significantly less from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open for further negotiation or can proceed with buying from John."
