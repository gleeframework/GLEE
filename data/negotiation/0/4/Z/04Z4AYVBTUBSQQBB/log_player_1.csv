"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, your starting price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique advantages and potential this product holds."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your price is still far too high for me. I can increase my offer to $600,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to consider at this stage. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from a reasonable price. While moving towards John's offer is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal than $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we're still quite a ways off.  To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 isn't feasible for me. I can offer $700,000 as a sign of good faith, but that's pushing my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is increasing, but very slowly.  We are still closer to the beginning of the negotiation than the end. It's time to apply pressure and make Bob aware of the alternative. A strong counteroffer is needed to see if he's willing to make a substantial jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but the offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. My final offer is $1,500,000. This is non-negotiable. I have another buyer ready to close at this price, but I'm giving you the first option to make a decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the final offer. By stating you have another buyer at this price, you create urgency and signal that you're willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. This leaves the ball in his court and puts maximum pressure to see if he'll budge significantly."
