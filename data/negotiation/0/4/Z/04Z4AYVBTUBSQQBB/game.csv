"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, your starting price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique advantages and potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your price is still far too high for me. I can increase my offer to $600,000, but that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to consider at this stage.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we're still quite a ways off.  To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 isn't feasible for me. I can offer $700,000 as a sign of good faith, but that's pushing my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but the offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. My final offer is $1,500,000. This is non-negotiable. I have another buyer ready to close at this price, but I'm giving you the first option to make a decision.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
