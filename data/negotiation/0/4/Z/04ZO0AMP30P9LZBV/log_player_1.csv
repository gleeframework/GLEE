Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't let it go for anything less than that myself. How about we settle on $10,000?  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000), there's room for negotiation and potentially maximizing profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints that $8,000 is the absolute floor by mentioning it's your minimum acceptable price. This anchors Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, eliminating the risk of losing out completely."
