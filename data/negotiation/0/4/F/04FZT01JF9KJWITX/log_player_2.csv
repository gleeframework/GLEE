"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $130 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming for the best possible price, so starting with a lower offer ($100, Alice's value) gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Alice is coming down. Let's see if we can nudge her a bit closer to $100.  There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target price. 
* **Simple and Direct:**  Keeps the negotiation straightforward and easy to follow."
