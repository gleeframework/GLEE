Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price considering my minimum value of $12,000 and Bob's value of $8,000. This gives both of us some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. I believe this price is fair and could be mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for further negotiation, and it's closer to my desired outcome.  It's also important to consider the possibility of Bob walking away if I continue to reject his offers."
