"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a good starting point for your counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Remember, your goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can try to counter-offer again to see if you can get closer to your target price.  Remember, you can always buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's most recent offer.  It shows that you're willing to negotiate but also that you have a firm price in mind."
