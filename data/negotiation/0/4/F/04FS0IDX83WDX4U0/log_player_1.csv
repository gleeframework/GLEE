"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is close to my ideal price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer if needed. 
* **John as a backup:** Keeping John in mind, I'm not willing to drop below $8,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Although Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **More room to negotiate:**  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to try and reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a backup:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $8,000, I believe I can get more from Bob if I continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that $8,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm still holding my ground, making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or even a stalemate. 
* **Time pressure:** We're now in Round 4, and I have limited time before John's offer expires.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this deal is slightly less than I hoped for, it's a good starting point for future interactions with Bob.

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal $10,000, accepting this offer minimizes risk and allows me to secure a sale quickly."
