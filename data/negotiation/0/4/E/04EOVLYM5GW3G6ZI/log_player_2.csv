"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and Alice has indicated a willingness to come down from her initial asking price. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get the price closer to his desired range."
