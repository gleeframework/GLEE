"Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your value for the product and my budget, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $825,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you a price of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
