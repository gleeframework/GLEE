"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. This offer is valid for the next 24 hours. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting it and seeing if she'll come down. You have the security of buying from John for $1,000,000, so you have some bargaining power."
