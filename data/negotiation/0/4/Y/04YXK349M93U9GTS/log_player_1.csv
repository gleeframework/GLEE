Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $8,000, giving her leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
