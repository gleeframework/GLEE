Round 2

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still securing a significant profit for me."

Although this offer is closer to John's offer,  it's still a decent profit for me and we are running out of rounds.  I'll take it and avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
