"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider lowering the price? I was thinking something closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to consider a lower offer. However, I still need to make a profit from this sale. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between your offer and my original offer. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous one, and settle on $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
