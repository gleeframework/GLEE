Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  At $140, the product still represents a good deal for Bob. 
* **Below your minimum:** This offer is above your minimum of $150.
* **Allows for negotiation:** It leaves room for both of you to negotiate.  

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the best price while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above Bob's perceived value, it is still below my minimum of $150.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he is unwilling to go higher than $130.  Rather than continue to negotiate with him, I will sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum price and guarantees a profitable sale."
