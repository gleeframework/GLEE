"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market and your budget. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows for a good margin for both of us and reflects the product's unique capabilities. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $925,000 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
