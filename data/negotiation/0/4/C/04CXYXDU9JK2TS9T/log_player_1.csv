Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quickly at $14,000 might be more desirable than a potential delay or negotiation with John. 

This strategy aims for a high initial offer while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
