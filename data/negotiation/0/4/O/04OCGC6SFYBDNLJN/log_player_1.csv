Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,000, so I'm thinking $15,000 is a fair price. Can we agree on that?
