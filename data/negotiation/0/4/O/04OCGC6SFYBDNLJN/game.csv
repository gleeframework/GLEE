"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,000, so I'm thinking $15,000 is a fair price. Can we agree on that?",15000.0,Bob,4,
