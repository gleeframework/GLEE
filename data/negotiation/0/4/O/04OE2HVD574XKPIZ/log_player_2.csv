"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $12,000, especially since the product is worth more to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, Alice's offer of $11,500 is pretty close to your maximum price of $10,000, and you risk her walking away or making a counteroffer even higher. Accepting this offer saves you time and ensures you get the product."
