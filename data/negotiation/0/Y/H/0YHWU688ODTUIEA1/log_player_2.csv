"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a low counter-offer, significantly below Alice's asking price but still above her product valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down in price, but it's still above her product valuation. We're making progress. It makes sense to hold out for a better price at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer but aiming to keep it below the midpoint between our previous offer and her current one.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,000.  Let's split the difference at $7,625. I think this is a fair compromise, given the value of the product to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to her valuation, but we still have some bargaining power. We're willing to go a bit higher, but not to $7,625 just yet.  We'll try to nudge her down a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  How about $7,400? That's a significant move on my end and demonstrates my seriousness about closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 7400
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're edging closer to her likely bottom line but demonstrating we're willing to negotiate in good faith with a reasonable counteroffer. This keeps the pressure on Alice while leaving us room to go slightly higher if needed."
