Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  There's a significant gap between my minimum value ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **First Offer:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential compromise without appearing too inflexible.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob without rushing into a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a little too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also far below the initial price I offered, suggesting Bob isn't serious about a fair deal.
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John at $150 is a far more profitable and less risky move than accepting Bob's low offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While rejecting Bob's offer, I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately far too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not immediately jumping to John.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  $100 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum.  It signals that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to emphasize that my counteroffer is reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $80 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm not willing to accept a price that low.
* **John's offer is better:**  Since John is willing to pay $150, selling to him is the most logical choice. It guarantees me a profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiations with Bob could drag on, potentially costing me time and energy.  Selling to John is the faster and more profitable option."
