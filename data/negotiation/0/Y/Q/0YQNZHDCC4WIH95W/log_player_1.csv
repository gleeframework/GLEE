Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This shows you're serious about selling but not giving away the product cheaply.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob's perceived value is $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and still find the deal beneficial.
* **It incentivizes Bob to negotiate:** A counteroffer from Bob will likely be closer to your desired price than John's offer of $1,000,000.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to maintain a good relationship with Bob in case you need to negotiate with him again in the future."
