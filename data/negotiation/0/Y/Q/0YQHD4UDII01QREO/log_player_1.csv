"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a significant profit while also leaving some space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not desperate. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping this compromise will be attractive to Bob while also securing a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still a profitable deal for me. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I'll reject it and continue negotiating with him. There's still a chance we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,550,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's increasing offers.  If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure if Bob will ever meet my minimum acceptable price.  There's only a small difference between Bob's offer and John's offer, and I'm confident that John will accept my offer.  It's better to secure the deal with John and guarantee a profit than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
