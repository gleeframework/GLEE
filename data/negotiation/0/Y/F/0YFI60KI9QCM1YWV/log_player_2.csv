The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to start by making a significant counteroffer at $10,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This gives him room to negotiate upward if Alice is unwilling to accept such a low price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum price.  There's no reason to further negotiate, so Bob should accept her offer and buy the product for $12,000."
