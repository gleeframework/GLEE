Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob in the message. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is not a final price, leaving room for both of us to compromise.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $1,050,000 is still a good price, it's below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for a better price:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that's favorable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000?  This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the discount he's getting compared to my initial offer. This reinforces the value proposition.
* **Fairness:** The price still allows me to get closer to my desired range. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,075,000? That's a reasonable compromise between our two offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $1,075,000 is still lower than I initially wanted, it's only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob backing out entirely or lowering his offer even further. 
* **Time and effort:**  The deal is close enough that it's not worth the potential time and effort of further rounds of negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I've secured a good price, albeit not the best possible, and I've avoided the risk of losing the sale entirely."
