"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to work with him while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While getting $9,200 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not at my minimum threshold.  It's a bit of a risk, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going to offer $9,400 to Bob.  This is a small increase from his last offer, but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and we're in the middle of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that we're at a stalemate, and I might not be able to reach my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiations."
