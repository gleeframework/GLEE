# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. While I initially offered it at $12,000, I am willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose we finalize the deal at $11,000. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs.
