"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000, to see if Bob is seriously interested. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit. If he rejects, we'll start the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to get closer to $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my need to receive a price closer to my minimum. We're getting closer with each round, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below where I'd like to be. I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, putting me very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close, but I'm running out of rounds.  I need to make sure I get at least my minimum price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of my guaranteed offer from John. To avoid the risk of not getting my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000."
