"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $750,000 is just a bit too low for me right now.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer the product for $850,000. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
