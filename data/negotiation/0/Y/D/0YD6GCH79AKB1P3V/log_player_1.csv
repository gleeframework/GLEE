"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation and acknowledging that Bob may counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a good amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to $1,400,000 by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000, meeting Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and signals I'm serious about closing the deal, while still securing a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob keeps lowering his offers.  While I could continue to counter, I'm concerned about the potential for the deal to fall through altogether.  I don't want to risk going too low and ultimately losing a deal altogether.  $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, and I'll accept that."
