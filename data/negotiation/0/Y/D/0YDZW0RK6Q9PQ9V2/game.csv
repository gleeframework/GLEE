"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider reducing the price to match my budget?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to lower the price to $115. That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $115 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a price that aligns more closely with what I'm able to spend. Could we perhaps aim for $100 as a middle ground?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work for both of us. $100 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $125? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a profit while you still get a good deal on this amazing product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product and your desire to maintain a profit. However, I believe we can find a solution that suits both of us better. Could we agree on $110 for the product?",110.0,Bob,6,
