Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's worth the price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't reveal your minimum price or the existence of another buyer. This keeps the negotiation power in your hands.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""I think you'll find it's worth the price""  projects value and might make Bob more likely to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always lower your price, but you can't raise it once an offer is made."
