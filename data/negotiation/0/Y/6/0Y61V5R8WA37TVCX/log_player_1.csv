Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a good deal for Bob:**  $100 is a reasonable price for Bob, considering he values the product at $120.
* **Provides room for negotiation:** There's room to increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more, but you also have a fallback option with John.
* **Clearly states the offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids potential further negotiation rounds."
