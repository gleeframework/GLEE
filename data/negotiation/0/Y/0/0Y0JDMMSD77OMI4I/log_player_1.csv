"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is a reasonable profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price closer to my initial offer.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 might be a bit low.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly very interested and is moving closer to my price.  Accepting his offer of $95 secures a good profit, and it's not worth the risk of him walking away if I push for more."
