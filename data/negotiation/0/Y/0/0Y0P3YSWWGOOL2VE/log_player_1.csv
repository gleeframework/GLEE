Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a truly unique piece, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Mentioning the product's uniqueness and value can pique Bob's interest and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking for Bob's opinion encourages him to engage and potentially counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping my minimum price and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual value. How about we set the product price at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I believe I can get a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. I will carefully craft a counteroffer that is more attractive to Bob while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This gives you a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting in the middle, but I'm also justifying the price by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Focus on a win-win:**  I'm framing the offer as a way for Bob to get a good deal while still allowing me to cover my costs. This positions me as a fair negotiator.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  I'm not drastically lowering my price, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. 

This counteroffer balances the need to keep the negotiation going with the need to get a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in this offer and is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about setting the product price at $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $15,000 is my absolute minimum for selling the product, so accepting this offer ensures I don't lose money.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree.  Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **John's offer is the same:**  Selling to John would result in the same price. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum desired price and avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation."
