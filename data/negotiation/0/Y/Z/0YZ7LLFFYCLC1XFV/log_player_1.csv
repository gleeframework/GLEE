Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** I highlight the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly justify the high price, even though Bob might not value it as highly as I do.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I'm confident it will be highly beneficial"" and ""What do you think?"" suggest I'm open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit from Bob while keeping the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
