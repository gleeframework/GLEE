Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'd like to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's try $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly more than John's offer and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Delaying further risks Bob walking away, and time is also a factor."
