Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm confident I can get a good price for the product. If Bob rejects my offer, I can lower it a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $8,000. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
