Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $80. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer before making any further decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's significantly higher than his offer of $70. It also allows me to stay above my minimum price of $80 while being open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely. It's better to secure the deal now at my minimum price than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
