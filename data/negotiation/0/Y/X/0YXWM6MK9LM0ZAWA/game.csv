"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12500 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget is $8000, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to discussing a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still too high. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $9000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both reach a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $9500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to accept, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,7,
