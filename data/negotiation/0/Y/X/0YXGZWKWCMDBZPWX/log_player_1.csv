Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but that's it. I'm offering the product for $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm still slightly above my minimum, I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will come up to my asking price. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
