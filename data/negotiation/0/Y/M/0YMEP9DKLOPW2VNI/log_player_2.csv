"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we discuss a price that reflects its worth while also ensuring it's within your budget. Considering the product's true value is $150 to me, I propose a fair offer of $135. This allows us to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. If this proposal works for you, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.
