"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is above your maximum budget. While it's tempting, you know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with purchasing from John."
