"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, but still below his target.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the bargaining power with Bob. It allows him to continue pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This shows my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring I can acquire the product at a price that works for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $975000. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still a $20,000 gap. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal within the remaining rounds.  It's still a good deal compared to buying from John, so there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit, but $980,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle once more.  I'm willing to offer $970,000 for the product. This represents a solid compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $970000. I'm willing to offer $985000 for the product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. There's a chance Alice won't budge further, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  $985,000 is a good deal for Bob considering his target and the time remaining in the negotiation. It's a better option than potentially risking a higher price later or having to settle for John's offer."
