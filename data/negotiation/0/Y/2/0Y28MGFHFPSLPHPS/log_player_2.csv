Considering its true worth, I'd like to extend this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $95. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a significant saving compared to the market value. I trust you'll find the product invaluable. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate with John or potentially find another seller who is willing to sell the product closer to Bob's budget."
