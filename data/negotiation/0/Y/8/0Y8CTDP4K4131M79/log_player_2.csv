"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to own something that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13500, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for less than John's price and it's closer to his desired price point. While there's always the chance of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially having to buy from John for a higher price is too high."
