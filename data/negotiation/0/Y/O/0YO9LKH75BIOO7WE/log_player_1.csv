Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering it slightly above that won't be enticing enough.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) and still allows Alice to potentially get a higher price than John's offer. 

**It's a delicate balance:**  The offer is high enough to be profitable for Alice if Bob accepts, but not so high that it would immediately scare him off."
