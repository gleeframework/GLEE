**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at a price point significantly higher than your absolute limit ($8,000).  She's shown no willingness to come close to that number.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're happy with. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
