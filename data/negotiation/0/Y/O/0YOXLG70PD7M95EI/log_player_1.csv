Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, given its unique nature and my budget. I'm confident this offer is fair, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
