"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,300,000.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
