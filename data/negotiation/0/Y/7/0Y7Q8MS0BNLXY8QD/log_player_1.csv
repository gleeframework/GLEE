Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,300,000.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,300,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is finally within my acceptable range. It's still significantly lower than my initial asking price, but it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept.  There's a risk that I could try to push for a higher price in future rounds, but it's not guaranteed that Bob would be willing to go higher.  Selling now guarantees me a good profit, and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely or my having to settle for a lower price in later rounds."
