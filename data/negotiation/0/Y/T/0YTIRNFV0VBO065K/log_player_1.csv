"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It also keeps me above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102.5}
```

I'm counteroffering at $102.5.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it shows I'm still firm on my price while being willing to meet Bob halfway. This is a good compromise to make the deal happen, especially since we are now at the midpoint of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and we're already halfway through the negotiation.  Rather than risk further haggling and potentially not reaching a deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures I get a guaranteed price that's acceptable to me."
