{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I am willing to pay.  However, I believe I can get her lower with further negotiation, so I'll reject this offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $12,800 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12400. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal, but Alice is still not budging significantly.  With only three rounds remaining, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.  It's time to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for a guaranteed $10,000. While I would have preferred to get a lower price, I've saved $1,000 compared to Alice's most recent offer.  It's better to guarantee the purchase within my budget than risk losing the opportunity and potentially having to pay more in the future."
