"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1750000, and that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
