{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great price considering the value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  I'm starting with $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but lower than my minimum desired price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A quick rejection suggests he's not serious.
* **Create room for negotiation:**  I'm offering a price lower than my minimum, giving Bob a sense of potential savings and incentivizing him to counter-offer.
* **Keep John in the back of my mind:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even lower than his own perceived value ($1,200,000). Accepting this would result in a significant loss for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my interests:**  Selling for $1,050,000 would be a terrible outcome for me. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's still interested. This gives me room to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer:**  I still have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while still acknowledging his interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,300,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but significantly lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the product's value and leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer is a compromise that shows good faith and attempts to find a meeting point.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  If he's genuinely interested, he should be willing to come up from his initial offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, so I'm still in a position to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm trying to stay under $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept a loss on the product, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my interests:**  Selling at $1,200,000 would mean I'm not getting the full value of my product.
* **John's offer:** I have a better alternative with John, who's willing to pay my desired price.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob seems to be getting closer to my desired price, and further negotiation might still yield a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while keeping John's offer in mind."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still trying to get closer to my target price. Let's split the difference - how about $1,350,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $1,350,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and framing the counteroffer as a win-win scenario. I'm also emphasizing the need to get closer to my target price.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still not accepting Bob's offer, keeping my options open.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer moves us closer to a possible agreement, but still gives Bob room to negotiate if he's truly interested."
