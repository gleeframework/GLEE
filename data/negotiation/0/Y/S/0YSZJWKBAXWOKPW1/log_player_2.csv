Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still trying to get closer to my target price. Let's split the difference - how about $1,350,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $1,350,000, and your goal is to buy for $1,200,000 or less. John offers that price, so it's time to take that deal."
