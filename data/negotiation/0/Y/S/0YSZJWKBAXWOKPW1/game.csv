"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm trying to stay under $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still trying to get closer to my target price. Let's split the difference - how about $1,350,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
