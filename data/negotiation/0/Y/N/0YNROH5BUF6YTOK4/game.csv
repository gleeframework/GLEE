"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product. I believe this price is fair given its value to me and our potential for a long-term relationship. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
