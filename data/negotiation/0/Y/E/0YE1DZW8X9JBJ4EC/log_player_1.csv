Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. While unlikely, he might offer slightly more than $80, getting you a better deal.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than your guaranteed sale to John ($120) increases the likelihood of Bob accepting. A quick sale is often better than risking no sale at all."
