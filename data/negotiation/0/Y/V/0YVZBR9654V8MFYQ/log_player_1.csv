Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price, but I'm not ready to accept his offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I'm hoping to push him closer to $1,350,000 in the next round."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,320,000. This is a significant offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1320000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still push Bob to a higher price. Selling to John now would guarantee me my target price, but I'm hopeful that I can close the deal with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop to $1,310,000.  It seems we're only $10,000 apart.  I believe we can find a middle ground to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1310000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer. I'll pay $1,305,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,305,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,305,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will come up to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I've tried my best to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price, so it's the best option at this point."
