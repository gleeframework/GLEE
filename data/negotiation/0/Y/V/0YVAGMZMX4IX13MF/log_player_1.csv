"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also a significant amount above my minimum of $15,000, making it worth his while to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is only $1,000 below my ideal. It's worth accepting this offer considering there are still six rounds left and the risk of potentially ending up with only $15,000 if I continue to negotiate."
