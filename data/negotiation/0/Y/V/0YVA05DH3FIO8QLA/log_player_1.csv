Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects its exceptional qualities and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or have more time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not willing to go lower.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price with some more negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to meet you halfway this time. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This offer reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking $1250000 is a fair price for this product. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is not progressing as I'd hoped.  While I'm confident in the product's value, Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my target price, and I'm concerned that pushing for a higher price will result in a stalemate or an even lower final offer.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's more prudent to secure the $1,000,000 offer from John and avoid the risk of walking away with nothing."
