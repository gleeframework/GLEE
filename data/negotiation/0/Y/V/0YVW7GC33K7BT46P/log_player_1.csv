Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without explicitly stating your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at selling the product ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, even though John would also pay the same amount. 

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
