I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle on $95? I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, let's say $105. That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Alice,5,
