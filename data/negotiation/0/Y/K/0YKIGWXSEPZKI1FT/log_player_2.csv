"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation before reaching John's $15,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation before reaching John's $15,000 price. Alice moving towards the middle indicates willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $11,000? That's a compromise I can work with."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer and my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
