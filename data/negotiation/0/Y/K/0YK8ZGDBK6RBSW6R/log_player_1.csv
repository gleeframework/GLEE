"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still a significant amount above my minimum. I'll counter, but I'm also keeping John in mind.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I see your point, but $18,000 is closer to the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $13,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is clearly interested but trying to negotiate me down. $13,000 is a decent profit, and going lower might make him lose interest.
