{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a decent profit while still potentially finding common ground with Bob.  I've left some room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while remaining fair to you.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
