{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, considering it's worth $12,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $9,500 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal with Bob."
