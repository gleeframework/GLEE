Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down significantly, her ""final offer"" of $1,100,000 is still more than John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as it's unlikely she'll go below John's price. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
