"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's make a deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
