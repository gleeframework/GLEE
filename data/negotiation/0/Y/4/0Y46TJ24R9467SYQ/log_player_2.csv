"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the same product from John for a lower price. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, as there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to market value. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $980,000 as a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to achieve a good outcome, and it's a reasonable midpoint between our positions.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $980,000 is a good price for the product, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away from the deal."
