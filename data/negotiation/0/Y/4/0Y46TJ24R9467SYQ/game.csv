"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm prepared to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $980,000 as a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to achieve a good outcome, and it's a reasonable midpoint between our positions.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",980000.0,Alice,3,
