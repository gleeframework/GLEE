"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's something you value at $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  What do you think about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $100 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower to avoid losing the sale."
