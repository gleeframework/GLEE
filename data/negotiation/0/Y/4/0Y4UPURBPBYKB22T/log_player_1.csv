Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $140 is still within a reasonable range for both of us, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Option to Walk Away:** I'm always aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $120 is Bob's perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed alternative with John. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product is well worth it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable and productive.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and suggesting that $130 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be open to a price closer to $120?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Room for Compromise:**  Bob has repeatedly offered $120, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already moved closer to his price and there's little chance he'll increase his offer.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob is a waste of time. I'm unlikely to get a better deal from him.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John at $150 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
