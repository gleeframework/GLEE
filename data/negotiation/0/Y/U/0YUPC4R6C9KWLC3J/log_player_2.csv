"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation, or you can simply buy from John and save money."
