"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be the perfect buyer. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that's closer to her own value for the product but still below his maximum budget. This shows good faith and could encourage Alice to counter with a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still within Bob's budget of $10,000. This is a good deal for Bob as he's saving $1,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk Alice could reject another counteroffer and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the safest and most financially advantageous option."
