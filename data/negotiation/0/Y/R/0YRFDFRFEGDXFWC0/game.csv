"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $9000?  I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to $9500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000 as a final compromise.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $10000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9750, which is as high as I can go without exceeding my budget. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",9750.0,Bob,6,
