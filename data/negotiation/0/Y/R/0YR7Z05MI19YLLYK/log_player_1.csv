Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not desperate for a sale, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd like to get more from Bob, we've reached a stalemate, and I'm running out of time. Selling to John ensures a solid profit and saves me the risk of further negotiation."
