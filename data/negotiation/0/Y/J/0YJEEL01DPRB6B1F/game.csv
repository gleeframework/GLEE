"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $12000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects the product's value, and it's a fair compromise, I think.  Let's see if we can make this work!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Would you consider selling the product to me for $12750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
