Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's ambitious:**  Starting high allows for more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's reasonable:** $15,000 is significantly higher than your minimum, but not so high that it instantly seems unreasonable.
* **It's friendly:** The message is positive and encouraging, setting a good tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to get the highest possible price, but you also want to be mindful of potential counteroffers and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below the starting point I had in mind. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe the product is worth more than that. I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to reach a compromise that's more advantageous."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the product's value, and it's a fair compromise, I think.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. Would you consider selling the product to me for $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $12,750, which is closer to my preferred price. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a good deal and  it's getting closer to my desired outcome.  Accepting his offer at this point is a smart move, as the risk of continuing negotiation and potentially ending up selling to John for $10,000 is too high."
