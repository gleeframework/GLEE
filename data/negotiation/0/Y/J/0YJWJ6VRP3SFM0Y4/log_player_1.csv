"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm hoping to get as close to the $8,000 value for Bob as possible, but I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price,  it's not worth risking a protracted negotiation.  I can secure my minimum value and move on."
