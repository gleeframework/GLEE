"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's a reasonable price that's lower than what the product is worth to me, but still above what it's worth to Bob. This gives him an incentive to negotiate, but also leaves room for me to make some profit.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive, which can help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I want to earn.  I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground.  There are still 8 rounds left, giving us ample time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still not satisfied. There are more rounds left, and I think I can get a better price. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to get a little worried about time, I'm still not going to accept $87.50. I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob, hoping that I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $87.50 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise one last time: I'll drop the price to $89. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 89} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $89 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $88. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120 is too high.  $88 is a decent price, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
