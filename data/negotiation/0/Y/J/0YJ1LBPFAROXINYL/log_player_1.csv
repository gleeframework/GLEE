Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I mention the product being a ""great deal"" and ""useful"" to highlight its potential benefits and encourage Bob to see value in it.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly and offering a new deal. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and well below the starting price I offered.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows that he's interested in the product. This opens an opportunity for negotiation.
* **Potential for a Compromise:** I believe there's a good chance we can find a middle ground where both of us are happy.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price. I'll likely propose a price somewhere between $85 and $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my product. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Compromise:**  $125 is a reasonable middle ground that shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I reiterate appreciation for his interest and maintain a friendly and encouraging tone.
* **Value Reinforce:** I emphasize the product's value to justify the counteroffer price. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects again, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or move on to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my target price, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further, potentially leading to an unacceptable price for me. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is more than what I'm currently getting from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

Since I'm confident I can get a better price with John, I'm going to sell the product to him.  This avoids the potential hassle and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
