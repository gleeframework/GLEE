Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000, giving me a potential profit.  It's also not so high that it's immediately off-putting to Bob. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I'm creating some room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, great! If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value."
