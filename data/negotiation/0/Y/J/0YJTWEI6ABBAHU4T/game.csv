"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This ensures we both benefit from this fantastic opportunity.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
