Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it invaluable. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique value and potential for your success. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the product's worth to him.  There's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a higher price from Bob.  If he won't budge, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This ensures we both benefit from this fantastic opportunity.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
