"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum price than it is to her own value for the product.  I need to counter with a significantly lower offer to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a bit high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider $875,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still heavily favoring her own desired price. It seems there's room to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and propose a counter that meets her a bit closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but $875,000 is still more than I had in mind. Perhaps we could meet somewhere in the middle?  How about $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to be realistic about the product's value. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We are making progress, but Alice's concessions are getting smaller.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't move closer to my range. Another counteroffer is needed to nudge her down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I need to be mindful of my budget."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
