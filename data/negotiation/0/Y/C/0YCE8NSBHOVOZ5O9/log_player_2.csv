"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell as her offer is already below her perceived value. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This approach might incentivize Alice to meet me closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to my range, but I'm just $500 away from my best alternative (buying from John). I'll try one more time to nudge her closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could do $12,100.  That's really stretching my budget, but I think it's fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12100
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price slightly above my backup plan with John, signaling to Alice that I'm serious about buying but need her to move closer to my limit. This keeps the negotiation going while still aiming for a good deal."
