``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering $110 for the product. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still a significant amount of money for Alice, but it's within my budget."

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price point of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further, but I need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal altogether."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $120. It's getting close, but I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price.  John is offering the product for my maximum, so it's the safest option to avoid further negotiation and potential price increases."
