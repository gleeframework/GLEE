"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.

It's unlikely we'll get Alice to go much lower than $1,200,000.  At this point, accepting the guaranteed deal from John for $1,000,000 makes more sense than potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
