"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant opportunity, but I understand if it doesn't fit your current needs. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1200000. I'm confident you'll see the potential here, but ultimately the decision is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
