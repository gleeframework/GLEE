Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's important to start high, as we have no information about Bob's willingness to pay, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Since selling to John would result in the same amount, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation."
