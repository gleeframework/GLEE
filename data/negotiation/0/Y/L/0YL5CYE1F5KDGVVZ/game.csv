"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 represents fair value to me, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a strong compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I can afford the product. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
