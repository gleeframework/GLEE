"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1000000 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $950000 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $975000?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to get a bit more for the product. How about we discuss a price of $975000 again, or I can go as high as $980000, but I think we can meet in the middle at $972500?",972500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I need to get a bit more for the product. How about we discuss a price of $955000? I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing money on the deal.",955000.0,Alice,9,
