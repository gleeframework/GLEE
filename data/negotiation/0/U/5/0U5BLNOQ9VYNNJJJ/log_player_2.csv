Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I believe a price closer to $900,000 reflects the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment with a lot of potential.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.
