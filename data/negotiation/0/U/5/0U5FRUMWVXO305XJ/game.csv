"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is still a fair price for you, given your value for it, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we compromise at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get closer to $10,500. Could you possibly reconsider my previous offer? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
