Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
