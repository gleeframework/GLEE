"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $9,000? It's a win-win - you get a good price, and I get the product I need.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is already a 16.7% discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
