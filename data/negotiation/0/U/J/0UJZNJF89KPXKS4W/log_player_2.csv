"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating against someone with a higher initial offer often benefits from a strong counter-offer.  This signals I'm serious but also leaves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states it's unacceptable. 
* **Targeting Below Value:** My goal is to pay much less than my $1,000,000 maximum. This offer aims to get Alice thinking in a lower price range.
* **John Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John. If Alice is completely unreasonable, I can walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice is moving slowly in her price reductions ($150,000 down from $1,450,000). This suggests she might have more room to negotiate.
* **Still Too High:** $1,300,000 is still significantly above my budget and my fallback option with John.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By continuing to reject, I signal that I'm serious about a much lower price and am willing to walk away."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me. I can go as high as $900,000, but that's the absolute limit of what I'm willing to spend. It's a good offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm raising my offer slightly ($100,000) to show I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still well below Alice's last offer.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating my ""absolute limit,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and putting pressure on Alice to consider my position seriously.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  Positioning the offer as fair for both parties aims to make Alice more receptive.
* **John Option in Reserve:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
