"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me. I can go as high as $900,000, but that's the absolute limit of what I'm willing to spend. It's a good offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
