Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm aiming for a profit.  We'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm lowering the price to be more realistic, but still aiming for a decent profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in getting the product for a bit more than what he initially offered."

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my target before I consider selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time and want to make sure I secure a sale.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
