"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $84. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",84.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $84 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $81. Let's make a deal and close this out.",81.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $81 just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $83.
