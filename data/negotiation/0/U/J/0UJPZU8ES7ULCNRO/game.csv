"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $13,000. This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to recoup some of my costs. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,500. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  I'm willing to go down to $12,750, which is a good compromise.  It's a great deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
