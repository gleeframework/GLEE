"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Strategic Opening:** While $1,200,000 is a significant premium, it's still lower than the value the product holds for me. This shows a willingness to negotiate while asserting my value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this offer. If he makes a counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy based on its value. 
* **Consider John's Offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall or become unfruitful, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price ($1,000,000), there's still potential to secure a higher price. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting closer to my desired value. It also allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price even higher.
* **Managing Risk:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $900,000 and $1,200,000. I'll consider the remaining rounds and the potential for a successful deal with Bob.
* **Monitor John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob become too drawn-out or unproductive, I'll shift to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. It's also above Bob's offer, indicating my desire for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With nine rounds left, I still have some room to negotiate, and I'm optimistic that a compromise can be reached. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a better outcome compared to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. His next action will determine my next steps in the negotiation.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or even consider selling to John depending on the remaining rounds and the potential for a successful deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price ($1,000,000) than before, but it's still a bit below my ideal.
* **Seeking More:**  With eight rounds left, I believe there's still potential to improve the price and secure a deal closer to my desired value. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk for a potentially better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.  With seven rounds remaining, we're getting closer to a potential agreement.

* **Prepared for Further Negotiation:** I'll be ready to make another counteroffer or even consider selling to John if necessary. I'll carefully evaluate the remaining rounds and the potential for a successful deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 away from my minimum price ($1,000,000), but with six rounds left, I still have room to push for a better price.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that I'm determined to get a price closer to my desired value. It also keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a more favorable deal.
* **Risk Calculation:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and maximize my earnings. The potential for a higher price from Bob outweighs the risk of losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $925,000 and $1,050,000. I'll consider the remaining rounds and Bob's previous behavior to determine the optimal counteroffer.
* **Monitoring John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob become too drawn-out or unproductive, I'll shift to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer ($925,000) and my previous offer ($1,050,000). This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining a strong negotiation position.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. This counteroffer is close to Bob's price point, indicating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Strategic Play:**  By offering $975,000, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm prepared to make a concession, but I'm also pushing for a price closer to my desired value. This could lead to a faster agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this offer. If he accepts, I've successfully secured a deal close to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and his previous behavior.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:**  I will remain prepared to make another counteroffer if necessary. However, I'll also consider John's offer as a fallback option, especially if negotiations with Bob become too drawn-out or unproductive."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of getting a significantly better price from Bob are slim. 
* **Minimal Gain:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $80,000 more than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, and the risk of further negotiation for a small gain is not worth it.

**Next Steps:**

* **Secure the Deal:** I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,000,000. 

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit while minimizing the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
