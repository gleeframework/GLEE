It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now $90, which is still better than buying from John for $100. It's also a better price than your counteroffer, so it's worth accepting."
