Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's halfway between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'll try to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $95, but still above Bob's offer of $85. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
