"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you're interested in its unique value. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is lower than your maximum price, there's a chance Alice might offer a better deal if you reject this one. You're willing to go up to $150, so you have some room to negotiate."
