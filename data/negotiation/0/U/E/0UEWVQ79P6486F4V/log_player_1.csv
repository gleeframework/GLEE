Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option,  giving a reason like ""given its value"" provides a subtle justification for the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies there's room for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important:**  While John guarantees $15,000, there's always a chance to get more from Bob. Aim high, but be prepared to negotiate if needed."
