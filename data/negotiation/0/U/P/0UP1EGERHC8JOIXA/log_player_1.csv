Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value *specifically to Bob*, making the price less arbitrary and more appealing.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is significantly higher than my backup offer from John but leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing us closer to his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
