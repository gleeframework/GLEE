"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, Alice, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $975,000 again. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
