"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. I believe that's a fair price based on my research and understanding of the market.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's true value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
