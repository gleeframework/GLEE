{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we meet a bit closer to my initial offer? Would you be willing to do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, considering he was initially offering $80.  It's worth it to close the deal rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's $80 offer."
