"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $110, a great deal considering its high value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a fantastic item at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120, meaning you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is still a good deal for you. 
* However, you're looking to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or purchase from John for $120. 

Rejecting Alice's offer opens up the opportunity for further negotiation or a potential better deal."
