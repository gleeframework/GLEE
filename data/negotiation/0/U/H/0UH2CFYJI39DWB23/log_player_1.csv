{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise. If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to think he's not serious about buying the product at a fair price.  I'm going to sell to John. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and secure sale."
