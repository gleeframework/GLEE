Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and your confidence in the offer, you make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Alternative Mention:**  Subtly mentioning you have other buying options (even without specifics about John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $10,000, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit beyond that baseline."
