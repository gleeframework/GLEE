"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $115. That's the lowest I can go.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close the deal, but $115 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and make it $112.50?",112.5,Bob,6,

"I understand that $112.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $114, and that's my final offer.",114.0,Alice,7,
