"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would still allow you to gain a good return while accommodating my financial situation.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This would still allow you to get a great value on the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I'm still working within a tight budget and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Could we perhaps meet at $8,750 for the product? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference and settle at $9,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
