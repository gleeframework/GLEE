Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would still allow you to gain a good return while accommodating my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's better than his initial stance, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I'm still working within a tight budget and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Could we perhaps meet at $8,750 for the product? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.

While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite enough. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push it a bit higher before selling to John."
