Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's always wise to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest. By mentioning you're ""open to discussing,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering at $20,000, you position yourself above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but not so high as to appear unreasonable and scare Bob away completely. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  However, it strategically positions you to either negotiate a higher price than your backup offer or move on to John without wasting time on lowball offers."
