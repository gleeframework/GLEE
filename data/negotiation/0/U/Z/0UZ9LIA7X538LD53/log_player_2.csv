"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, I think it would really be valuable to you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $150 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your actual goal. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and friendly tone is important for a smooth negotiation.
* **Clear Intention:** The message directly states your desired price and invites Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice lowered her price, but $130 is still significantly more than your $100 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a decent gap between your last offer and Alice's current one, indicating room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Backup:**  You still have the option to buy from John for $100 if the negotiations with Alice don't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** You've danced around the edges a bit, now it's time to be more direct about your budget limit.
* **Sense of Fairness:**  By framing the offer as ""meeting in the middle"" and a ""fair price,"" you appeal to a sense of compromise and reason.
* **Final Offer (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, the tone suggests this is likely your best offer, encouraging Alice to seriously consider it. 
* **John's Option:**  You're still prepared to walk away and go with John if Alice doesn't accept, but this offer gives her a chance to make a sale."
