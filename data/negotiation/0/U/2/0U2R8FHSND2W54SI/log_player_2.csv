"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $7,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $6500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $6900. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $6,900 is closer to his desired price point, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6,900 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $6,500.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $6750. This is my final compromise, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, coming down to $6,750.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John for $8,000.  This is a good deal, and the risk of further negotiation is too high."
