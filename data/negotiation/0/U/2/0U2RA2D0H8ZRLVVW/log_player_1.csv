Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) knowing it's likely Bob will reject it.  This establishes my starting point and allows for room to negotiate.
* **Value Gap:** There's a significant gap between my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This means there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as an alternative buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can walk away without losing money. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to use this initial offer to gauge Bob's interest and start a negotiation process. I expect Bob to counteroffer, and I'll then have to carefully assess whether his counteroffer is closer to my desired price or if it's worth pursuing a deal with John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There is still room for negotiation. I can potentially push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, which is a lot more than Bob's offer. However, I might be able to get closer to my goal through negotiation with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to continue negotiating. I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.  However, I'll keep John as my fallback option in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My previous offer was $1,000,000, and Bob countered with $900,000. This offer of $950,000 splits the difference, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Remaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, which provides me with some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's real interest. If he's serious about buying, he'll likely be willing to meet me closer to the middle ground.

**Strategy:**

This is a calculated move to test Bob's limits.  If he accepts, I'll have secured a decent deal. If he rejects, I can either try to push for a higher price or ultimately go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $275,000 lower than my ideal.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Each rejection brings us closer to a stalemate where we might waste time without reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit of $1,200,000, which is more than what Bob is offering and aligns with my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

At this point, the risk of continued negotiation outweighs the potential reward. I've established a reasonable starting point, and while I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm confident that John will provide a secure and profitable deal. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed income."
