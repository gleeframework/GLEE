Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible, as this is the highest price Bob might be willing to pay before it's more profitable to sell to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of getting $1,500 more than John's offer makes it a worthwhile gamble."
