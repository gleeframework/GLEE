{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob the incentive to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good price considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown interest and we've negotiated, his final offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's better to sell to John and ensure I get the price I need."
