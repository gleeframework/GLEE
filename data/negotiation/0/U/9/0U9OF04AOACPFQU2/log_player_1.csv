{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob have stalled.  While $918,000 is a decent price, it's still far from my ideal value.  John's offer is much closer to what I want, and the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  It's time to move on to a more promising opportunity."
