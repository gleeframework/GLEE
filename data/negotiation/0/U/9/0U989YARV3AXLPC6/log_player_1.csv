{""product_price"": 900,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $750,000. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. Let's try:

Let's see how Bob responds!"
