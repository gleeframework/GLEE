"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $1,150,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try to negotiate a lower price.  If negotiations fail, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its true value and will ensure both of us are happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is now at Bob's maximum price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget and saves him from potentially wasting more rounds in negotiation.  Buying from John would result in the same price, so there's no advantage to going that route."
