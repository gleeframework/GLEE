Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - I'll take $135 for the product."", ""product_price"": 135}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
