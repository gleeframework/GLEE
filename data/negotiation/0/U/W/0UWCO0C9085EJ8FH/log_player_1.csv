"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's worth and am not desperate for a quick sale. 

By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my desired price while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and there's a good chance Bob might be willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept this offer, as it's a significant improvement over his last offer and still represents a good value for him.

This approach allows me to test the waters and gauge Bob's willingness to compromise while still maintaining a position above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am still confident that I can negotiate a better price, and I have 6 rounds left to do so.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm confident that he's starting to realize the product's worth.  I'm willing to accept this price, but I'm still open to negotiation if Bob makes another counteroffer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for the same price, so I'm not taking a major risk.  However, I believe that Bob is more likely to accept this offer, as it's a fair price for him, considering the product's value to him."
