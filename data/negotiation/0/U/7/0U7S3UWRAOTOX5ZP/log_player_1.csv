"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to bite. I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to try and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my minimum, in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a great price for a fantastic product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down a bit. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  Would you consider $130? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for $130 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $132.  This is getting close to my bottom line, so I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132} 
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm also emphasizing that this is getting close to my bottom line to encourage Bob to take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're close to your bottom line, but $132 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $131?  It's a very small difference, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Since we are nearing the end of the negotiation and Bob's offer is close to my minimum desired price, I'll accept his offer. It's better to secure a sale at $131 than risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for $150."
