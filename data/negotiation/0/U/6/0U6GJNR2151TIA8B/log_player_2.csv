(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also determined to get a good deal. $8,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price. I'm not yet at the point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still within my budget, and hopefully, it's a price Alice will consider.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to sell for $10,000. I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice to see if I can get her to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to slightly increase my offer again, showing that I am willing to negotiate but also that I am not willing to go much higher than my current offer. $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I am hoping that Alice will finally accept. If she rejects this offer, I will seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not ready to accept. I'm only $500 away from my ideal price with John, so I'm going to push for a lower price with Alice one more time. There are only a few rounds left, and I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay John's price, so I'm giving Alice one last chance to accept. If she rejects, I'll move on to John, as I don't want to risk running out of rounds.  This offer is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
