"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we meet at $135? It's still a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've compromised already, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $128? It's the lowest I can go, but I really want this product and think it's worth it to me.",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $132? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $128 and $132, which would be $130. That's the highest I can go, but I really want this product and think it's worth it to me.",130.0,Bob,8,
