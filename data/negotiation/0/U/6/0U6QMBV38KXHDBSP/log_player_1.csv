Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation but also aims for a higher profit for Alice.
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" approach:**  This creates a sense of urgency and potentially limits Bob's ability to counter-offer, pushing him to make a decision quickly.
* **Backup plan:** Alice is secure knowing that if Bob rejects the offer, she can sell the product to John for its baseline value. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims for the highest potential profit, it also carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. A more moderate approach could involve a slightly lower initial price with room for negotiation."
