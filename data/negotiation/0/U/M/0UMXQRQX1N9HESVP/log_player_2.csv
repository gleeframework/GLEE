"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $95 is too close to your maximum price point of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85.  This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also giving me a good discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $90 is still too close to my maximum price point. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still too high for me. I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $87. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  I think this offer might be attractive enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is getting closer to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer again. I'm also concerned that we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's within my budget and saves me some time."
