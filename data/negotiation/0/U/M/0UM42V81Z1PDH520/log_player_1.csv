Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so anything less than that gives him a benefit.
* **My floor:** I won't accept anything less than $10,000 as I can get that from John.
* **Maximizing profit:** $12,000 is a good compromise, ensuring a higher profit than selling to John while still being attractive to Bob."
