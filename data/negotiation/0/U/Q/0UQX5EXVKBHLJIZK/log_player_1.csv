Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, the message aims to justify the price by highlighting the ""value it provides."" This subtly encourages Bob to consider potential benefits beyond his initial valuation.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $150."
