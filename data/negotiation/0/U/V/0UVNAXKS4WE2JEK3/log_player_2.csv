It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for the value you place on the product."

This offer is still a bit higher than Alice's valuation, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It shows you are serious about buying the product, but you also want a good deal."

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

This counteroffer is a little higher than my desired price, but it's a good compromise considering Alice's last offer. I'll try to see if she'll accept it."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd rather just buy it from John and be done with it."
