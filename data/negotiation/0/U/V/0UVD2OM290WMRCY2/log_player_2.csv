# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** Your goal is to save money, and $15,000 is above your maximum budget. 
* **Rejecting allows negotiation.**  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Rejection keeps the negotiation going.**  By rejecting, you maintain the opportunity to push for a lower price and potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on $12000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which is still a compromise from my original offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's getting closer, $13,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **The risk of further negotiation is too great.** You have limited rounds, and it's not clear if Alice will ultimately accept your offer.
* **John offers a guaranteed price.** Buying from John ensures you get the product for your maximum budget, without the risk of further negotiation."
