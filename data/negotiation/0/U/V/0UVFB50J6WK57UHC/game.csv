"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $9000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. Let's split the difference - how about $10500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9000, so how about $10000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
