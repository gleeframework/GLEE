Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you some profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), making it potentially attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer gives you space to negotiate higher if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is more than your absolute minimum, it's still lower than what you'd prefer. It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  You have a better chance with Bob than selling to John, as the product is worth more to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750?  That way, we both walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $7,500, Alice.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially try to negotiate further, Bob's offer of $8,250 is a good deal. It's higher than your minimum of $8,000, and it's likely you won't get a significantly better offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit for you and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob."
