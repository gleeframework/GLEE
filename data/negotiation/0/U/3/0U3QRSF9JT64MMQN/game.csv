"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $12500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would allow me to make a fair profit and still be happy to let the product go to a good home.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
