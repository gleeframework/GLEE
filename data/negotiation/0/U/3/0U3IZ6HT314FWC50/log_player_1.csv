Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob refuses).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (This is the maximum Bob would theoretically pay).
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate down if needed. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  It's about finding the right balance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as high-value and desirable.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to engage in a conversation, making a deal more likely. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob reacts will determine your next move.  Be prepared to negotiate or hold firm depending on his counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
