I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice is asking for more than the product is worth to her ($1,000,000), it's still less than what John is asking ($1,200,000). 
* **You can save money.**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $50,000 compared to buying from John."
