"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise and closer to what I'm looking for.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $11,200 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll get. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
