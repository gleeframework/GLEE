This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not desperate. I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering it's worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my end.

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still reflects the value of the product."
