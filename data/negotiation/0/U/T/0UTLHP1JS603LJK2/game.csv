"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my end.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my need to get a good price.  Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
