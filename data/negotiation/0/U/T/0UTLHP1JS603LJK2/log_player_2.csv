"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's guaranteed price. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering Alice's offer or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering it's worth that much to me."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly below John's price. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counter-offer helps understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Establish a negotiation range:**  By starting lower, I aim to bring the potential agreement closer to my desired price point.
* **Avoid stalling the negotiation:** Offering a price too close to John's might encourage Alice to play hardball, knowing I have a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice decreased her offer, but it's still above John's price. It seems there's room for further negotiation. We should continue to counter-offer, moving closer to John's price incrementally."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my end."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By increasing my offer, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about the purchase but still looking for a better deal.
* **Gradual increase:** Instead of jumping straight to a price near John's, I'm incrementally moving upwards to test Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a price below $1,500,000.
* **Maintain a sense of urgency:** While I'm willing to negotiate, mentioning that this is a significant move subtly reminds Alice that I have other options and time might be a factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my need to get a good price.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
