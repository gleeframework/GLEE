"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for a product like this. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. Can you consider that?,135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, but $135 just isn't enough. I'm willing to go down to $145. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. How about we close the deal at $145?",145.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,6,
