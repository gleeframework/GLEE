"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000. While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob has a higher ceiling with John at $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I'm aiming for."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,750, which is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum price of $12,000 and only slightly higher than his counteroffer of $9,500. There's a good chance that Alice won't go lower, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
