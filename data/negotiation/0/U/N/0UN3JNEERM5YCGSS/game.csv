"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",800000.0,Alice,5,
