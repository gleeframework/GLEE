"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The product is worth $120 to her, so there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see what she says!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay, but she's coming down in price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it below $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

This offer is closer to Alice's likely minimum price, but it's still a few dollars below the current asking price. Hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's close to my ideal, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to lock in this deal."
