Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which is $15000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
