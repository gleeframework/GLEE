"Alice, your product looks great, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which is $15000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
