"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to start with an offer of $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to see if I can maximize my profits.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of the product ($120), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Building a Relationship:** The message is friendly and establishes a good start for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I want to push for a price closer to my initial $100 offer. 
* **Building Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my desired price ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to compromise but still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I use language like ""split the difference"" to make the counteroffer feel fair and mutually beneficial. 
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:** I keep the message polite to maintain a good relationship with Bob during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. I could go up to $88, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Seeking a Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer of $88 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and believe I can push for a better deal.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to continue the negotiation.  
* **Potentially Reaching a Compromise:** I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, Bob will become more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're being firm on your price.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Margin:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($92.50) and Bob's offer ($88), showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal for both of us,"" making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Show Confidence:** I'm using language like ""confident this is a good deal"" to project confidence and potentially nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $89, that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $89 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price is increasing.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting Bob's offer maintains a good relationship with him, potentially leading to future deals where I can negotiate a better price."
