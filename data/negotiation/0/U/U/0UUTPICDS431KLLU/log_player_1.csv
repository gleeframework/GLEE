Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how strongly I want to sell to him compared to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $125, which is still above my minimum but a step closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John. I'm willing to take the $110 to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a worse outcome or potentially losing him altogether."
