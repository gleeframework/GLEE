"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I value your product, $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $90?  That would give us both a good deal. ",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $90 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to spend right now. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
