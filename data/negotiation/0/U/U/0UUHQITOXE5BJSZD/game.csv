"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
