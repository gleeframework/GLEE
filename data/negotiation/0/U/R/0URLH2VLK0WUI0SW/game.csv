"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,150,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the product's worth. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
