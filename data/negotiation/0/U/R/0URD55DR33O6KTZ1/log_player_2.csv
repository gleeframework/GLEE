Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is only willing to sell for $117, which is still more than your ideal price. It's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a lower price from Alice, and it's better to buy the product from John for $150."
