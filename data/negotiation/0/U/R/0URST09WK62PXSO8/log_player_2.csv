"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance you can get it for less. Alice is starting the negotiation quite high above her own valuation of the product. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might encourage Alice to come down in price."
