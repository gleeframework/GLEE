"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a little, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  $110 is still a touch more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try $109.  That's only a couple of dollars higher than your last offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",109.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle this right now at $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
