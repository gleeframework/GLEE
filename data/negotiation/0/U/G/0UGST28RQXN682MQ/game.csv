"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects its value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. I'd like to offer $860,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation, and it allows us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $870,000. This price is still a bit higher than your original offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",870000.0,Alice,5,
