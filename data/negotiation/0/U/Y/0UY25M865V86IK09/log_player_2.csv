Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, I need to be honest - $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. To be fair to both of us, I believe there's still room to find a middle ground.  I'm open to exploring options that would make this deal work for both of us. Are you willing to continue this conversation? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $1,600,000. You've already stated your final offer of $1,000,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely you'll reach a deal. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
