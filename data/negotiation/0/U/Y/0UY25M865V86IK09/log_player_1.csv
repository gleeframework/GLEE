"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a price lower than $2,250,000 but still favorable to you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states this is an ""initial proposal"" and asks for Bob's thoughts, signaling your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** While not overly specific, mentioning the ""value and potential"" provides a vague justification for the high price without revealing your bottom line.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a price closer to your initial offer.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, you have ample space to negotiate downwards throughout the 10 rounds.
3. **Gauge Bob's willingness:**  His response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. While his offer is low, it indicates he's serious about purchasing the product. There's a lot of room for negotiation between $800,000 and your initial ask of $2,250,000. You have eight rounds left, giving you ample time to try and reach a more agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should present a counteroffer significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial price. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. "",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Coming down by $350,000 shows movement and a willingness to negotiate, but it's not a drastic drop that would make you seem desperate or undervalue the product. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Gently reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the still-high price.
* **Seeking Mutually Beneficial Agreement:**  This phrasing emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets his perceived value but remains below your absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean losing out on a significant sum. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" is a negotiation tactic. It's designed to pressure you into accepting but doesn't mean he'll walk away. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  You still have six rounds of negotiation. While time is a factor, you have space to try and draw him closer to your range. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, acknowledge his ""final offer"" but stand firm on your need for a higher price. You can soften the rejection by hinting at potential compromises without specifics. The goal is to keep him engaged while making it clear that $1,000,000 is not acceptable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, I need to be honest - $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. To be fair to both of us, I believe there's still room to find a middle ground.  I'm open to exploring options that would make this deal work for both of us. Are you willing to continue this conversation?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Not Accepting:** Directly addressing his ""final offer"" shows you're taking it seriously.  However, stating it doesn't ""reflect the true value"" maintains your position without being confrontational.
* **Compromise Language:**  Phrases like ""middle ground"" and ""make this deal work for both of us"" signal flexibility and encourage Bob to re-engage without explicitly stating you'll go lower. 
* **Strategic Price Drop:**  Dropping to $1,600,000 is a significant move towards your minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate but keeps you above your absolute bottom line, leaving room for further adjustments if needed. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking if he's ""willing to continue"" puts the ball back in his court, prompting him to respond and hopefully reveal if he's willing to move from his ""final offer."""
