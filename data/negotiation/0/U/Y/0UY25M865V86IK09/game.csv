"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial offer reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, I need to be honest - $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. To be fair to both of us, I believe there's still room to find a middle ground.  I'm open to exploring options that would make this deal work for both of us. Are you willing to continue this conversation?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
