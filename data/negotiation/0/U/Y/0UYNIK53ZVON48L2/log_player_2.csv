"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering its worth $15,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $11,500, and it's not worth risking a better deal. You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is a better outcome than $11,500."
