Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.
