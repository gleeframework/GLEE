Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate up to his price. 
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:**  By starting with a price slightly lower than his potential value, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for you. While selling to John for $12,000 is an option, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired $14,000. You can try to find a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Fair value:** It's above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money, while still being significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually agreeable solution, which can help maintain a good rapport with Bob.

Let's see if this counteroffer is acceptable to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly your minimum desired price and matches what John is offering. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer ensures you get your minimum price without any additional risk or delay."
