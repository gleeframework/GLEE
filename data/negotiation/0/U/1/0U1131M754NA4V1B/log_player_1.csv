Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The $130 price point allows for several rounds of negotiation if needed. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a strong fallback position if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for negotiation. I can counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a strong fallback:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. That still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $130 to $100, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Fair offer:** I'm positioning the counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have other options, as John is waiting to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John for $150 is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **No further negotiation:**  I've already made several concessions and there's little room for further negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  John offers a guaranteed profit, making him the better choice."
