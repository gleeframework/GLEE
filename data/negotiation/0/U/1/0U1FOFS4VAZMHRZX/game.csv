"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $160?

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the extra support and warranty you're offering. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $155 and throw in the extra support and warranty? That would be a great deal for me.",155.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're really close to making a decision, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already gone as low as I can without losing too much profit. I'm willing to throw in the extra support and warranty, but I need to get at least $158 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",158.0,Alice,7,
