"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but would be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. Would you be willing to consider that?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
