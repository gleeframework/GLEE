"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay from John. This is a good starting point for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. $700,000 is a substantial amount, but it leaves room for potential compromise while still saving you a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 950000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at 850000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than my initial counteroffer of $700,000.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can negotiate a better price by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. $750,000 is still significantly lower than her previous offer and closer to my ideal price point. I've positioned it as my ""final offer"" to put some pressure on Alice to make a decision."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at 800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $800,000, which is closer to my last counteroffer of $750,000. While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's a good deal considering I can purchase the product from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer will save me $700,000."
