Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, giving you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Aiming high, but leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's a price that significantly benefits you compared to your guaranteed sale to John ($11,500 vs. $10,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential surplus ($500).
* **Open-ended communication:** The message encourages Bob to engage in conversation, allowing for potential counter-offers if he's not immediately sold.

By starting high, you maximize your chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's perceived value. If he rejects the initial offer, you can always adjust your price downwards, knowing you have the safety net of John's offer."
