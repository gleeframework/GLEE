"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $70.",70.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $70 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $65, which would be $67.50. What do you think?",67.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $67.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is firm at $66. Would you be willing to meet me there?",66.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $66, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $67.50 and $66, which would be $66.75. What do you think?",66.75,Alice,5,
