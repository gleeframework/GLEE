Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $70 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $65, which would be $67.50. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $67.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

While $67.50 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. You're still within your 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $67.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is firm at $66. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 66}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $66, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $67.50 and $66, which would be $66.75. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $66.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $66.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've reached a point where further negotiation might lead to Alice becoming less willing to sell.  $66.75 is very close to your desired price and within your budget. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
