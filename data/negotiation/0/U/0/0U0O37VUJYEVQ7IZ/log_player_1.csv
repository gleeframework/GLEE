"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'll be watching closely to see how he reacts and adjust my strategy as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still not high enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to be flexible and meet him halfway.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,800 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000. Given that we're already in the 4th round, I think it's time to accept and close the deal. It's a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
