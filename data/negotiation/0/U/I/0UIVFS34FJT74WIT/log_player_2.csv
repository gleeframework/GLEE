You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $8,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to accept $10,000 for the product. This still leaves room for us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still above your target of $8,000. You should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your desired amount."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,500 for the product.  That's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

```

While $9,500 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your target.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can push Alice down to your desired $8,000. If not, you can always go with John's offer."
