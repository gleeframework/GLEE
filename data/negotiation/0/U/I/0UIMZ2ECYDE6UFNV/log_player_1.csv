{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm keeping in mind that Bob is willing to pay a lot, but I want to be strategic and leave room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is closer to my desired price.  Further negotiation might not yield a much better result, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
