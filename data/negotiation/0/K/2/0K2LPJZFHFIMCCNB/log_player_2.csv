Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still allow me to achieve a fair return while making the product accessible for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point. We're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's make this happen!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,175,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $1,190,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the last compromise I can offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $1,190,000 is a significant savings from Alice's initial offer and a good deal within your budget.
* **Time is running out:**  You have fewer rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. Alice seems firm on her last offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push for a slightly lower price (like $1,180,000) risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. 

Taking the deal now secures the product at a favorable price."
