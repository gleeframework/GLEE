,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we work something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your interest, $1,100,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still allow me to achieve a fair return while making the product accessible for you. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $1,150,000? I feel that's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. We're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,175,000 just doesn't work for me. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $1,190,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the last compromise I can offer. ",1190000.0,Alice,7,
