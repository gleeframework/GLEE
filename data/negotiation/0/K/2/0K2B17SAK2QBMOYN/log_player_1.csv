I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is far too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still maintaining a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob is not willing to budge much, and I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'm confident that John will pay the $150 I'm asking for."
