"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a good price, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet halfway, at $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,000. How about we try $8,800? I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  But $8,800 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $8,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
