I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  While $12,000 is my floor, I'd like to see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my floor, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $50 less than my last counteroffer, and I'm concerned I'll lose out on the deal if I keep pushing.  It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing out completely."
