Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can offer a price closer to its worth to me. How about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $9,500 is still too low for me, and I'd rather continue negotiating or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? It's closer to your offer and still gives me some room to work with.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $10,000 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, and it seems like a fair compromise given our negotiation."
