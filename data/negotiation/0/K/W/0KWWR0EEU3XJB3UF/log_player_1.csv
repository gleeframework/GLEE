"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives me space to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly opening can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $130 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, I have a guaranteed $150 with John, so I can afford to be firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $155. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to my minimum:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price below my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  Keeping the tone friendly can help keep the negotiation going. 
* **Giving Bob a chance:**  This counteroffer allows Bob to potentially accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob is pushing the price down, there's still room to negotiate.  
* **John remains a safe option:**  If I can't get a better price, I can sell to John and get my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about we split the difference at $147.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 147.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This shows a commitment to compromise while still being above my minimum.
* **Clear and concise offer:**  A direct and specific offer makes it clear what I'm asking for.
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighting fairness encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $147.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a better deal with Bob are decreasing.
* **Bob is unlikely to go higher:** Bob has consistently offered below my minimum, and his latest offer is even lower than his previous one.
* **John is a guaranteed $150:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and don't risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
