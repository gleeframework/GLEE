"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great value at $1,200,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a slightly lower price. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be comfortable going as high as $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. How about we settle at $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see that $875,000 is a good price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
