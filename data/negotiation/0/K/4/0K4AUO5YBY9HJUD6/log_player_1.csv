{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While $11,250 is still a decent price, I'm concerned that Bob might keep pushing lower and I might end up with a deal that's too close to my minimum threshold.  It's time to take the safe route and sell to John for $10,000."
