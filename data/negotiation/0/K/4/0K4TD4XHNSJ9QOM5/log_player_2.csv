"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point. You want to save as much money as possible and can use the negotiation to your advantage. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85? I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
