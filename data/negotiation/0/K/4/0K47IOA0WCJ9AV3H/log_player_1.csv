Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum, but I'm not in a hurry to sell. I can still try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. By saying it's my ""final offer"", I'm putting a little pressure on him to accept."
