"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly $15,000. This means you are getting no discount and saving no money.  You can get the same product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
