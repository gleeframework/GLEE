Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim for a much higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit for me while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to his own valuation. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed as a conversation starter, inviting Bob to consider the offer and potentially counter-propose, leaving room for further negotiation."
