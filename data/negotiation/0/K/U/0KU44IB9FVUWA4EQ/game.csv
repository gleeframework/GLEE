"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is likely much higher. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say, I'm still a bit surprised by the low offer. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counter with an offer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to accept.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but that's still a big jump from my initial offer. To be frank, I have other options I'm considering.  How about $650,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round, and I'm not willing to give up more value. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I can tell this product has value, but I also need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already given you a significant discount, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,7,
