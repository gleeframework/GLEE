"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12000?  This is my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the transaction.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
