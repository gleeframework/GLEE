"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can still buy from John for $1,500,000 if you don't reach a deal with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $2,000,000. It is still within your budget and hopefully attractive enough for Alice to consider, while giving you room to negotiate further if needed."
