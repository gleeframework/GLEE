"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I already have John willing to pay $150. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob, as he's unlikely to go higher. It's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
