"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum but not unreasonable. I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'd prefer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $150.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
