"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit low for me.  How about $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of this product for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be reasonable with my expenses.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.  It's a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
