Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a start, it's too low. I need to see if I can get a higher price from Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my goal, it's still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob before committing to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway at $1,000,000.
