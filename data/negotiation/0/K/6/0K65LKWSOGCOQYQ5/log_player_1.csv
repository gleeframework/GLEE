"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to see if I can get close to my desired value.  I'm also aware that Bob only values the product at $120, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell for that yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still aiming for a value higher than my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $160, Bob's offer of $145 is reasonable. It's only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that if I reject, he might lower his offer again or we could reach a stalemate.  With only 6 rounds left, it's better to take the deal now."
