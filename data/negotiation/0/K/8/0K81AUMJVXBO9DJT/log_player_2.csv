It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice is unlikely to drop much further.
* **Good deal:** $1,010,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly lower price isn't worth the risk of Alice walking away or the potential cost of missing out on the deal altogether."
