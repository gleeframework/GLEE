"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to start the negotiation high.  
* You have a better alternative with John ($1,000,000) if Alice doesn't come down significantly in price. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better deal and are willing to walk away."
