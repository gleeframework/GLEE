"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. How about $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
