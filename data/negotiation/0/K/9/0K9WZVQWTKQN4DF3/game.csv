"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $750,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $720,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $735,000.  That's a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiations moving forward.",735000.0,Alice,5,
