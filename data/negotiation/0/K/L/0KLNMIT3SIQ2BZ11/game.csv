"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am not able to pay such a high price. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price? I would like to propose $1400000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1400000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also include some additional support and training worth $200000 for free. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. While I'm interested in the product, I'm unable to agree to your latest offer. I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product, without the additional support and training. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
