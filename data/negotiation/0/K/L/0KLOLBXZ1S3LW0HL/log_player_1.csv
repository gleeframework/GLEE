"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to adjust based on his counteroffer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial asking price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this offer is reasonable and shows my willingness to work with Bob, while still ensuring a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm offering $12,500.  I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that we can find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I believe I can still get a higher offer with further negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
```

I'm offering $11,800. This is a significant compromise from my previous offers, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. We've gone through several rounds, and time is running out. I want to close this deal, but I also want to ensure that I don't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $10,800 is barely above my minimum, and there's no guarantee that he will accept any further counteroffers.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low for my product.  Selling to John at $10,000 ensures I get a fair price and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
