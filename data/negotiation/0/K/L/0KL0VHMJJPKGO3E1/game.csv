"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $16000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $18000?  This would give you a significant saving compared to my initial price, while still acknowledging the unique qualities of this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
