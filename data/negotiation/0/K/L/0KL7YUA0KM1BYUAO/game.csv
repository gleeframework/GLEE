"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you and allows for room to negotiate further. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my price range. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This price is fair considering my budget and the product's potential.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. This product has significant long-term value that I'm confident you'll benefit from.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This offer reflects my strong belief in the product's worth and is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me.  Given our ongoing discussions and my desire to reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and ensures we both achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
