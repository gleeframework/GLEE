Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him a small incentive to buy. It also leaves some room for negotiation if he counters.  However, it's significantly below your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you still make a profit if he rejects and you sell to John."
