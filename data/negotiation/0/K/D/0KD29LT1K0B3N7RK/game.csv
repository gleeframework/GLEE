"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that my initial offer was competitive. Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a better deal. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise that would allow us to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
