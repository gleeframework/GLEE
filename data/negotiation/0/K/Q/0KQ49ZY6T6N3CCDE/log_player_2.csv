"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is still worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for the potential of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's ideal price point. While there is a risk of losing the deal entirely, continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's latest offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is showing that he is willing to compromise but is still pushing for a price closer to his desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. The risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price outweighs the potential for a lower price.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his target price without the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
