"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a little more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, aiming for a compromise closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $132. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $132 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $130 and close this deal.  Let's make it happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $130.  While it's a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum value and closes the deal.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away or we might not reach a deal in the remaining rounds, and I'd end up selling to John for $150. It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the potential for a worse outcome."
