"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above her own valuation.  There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you and a great value for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a lower price.  The offer from John is always a safety net, so there's no rush to accept anything yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that's a bit lower.  I'm going to offer $860,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a small gap. It's worth pushing for a little lower price.  The offer from John is still a safety net, so there's no need to rush into accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close. I'm willing to go up to $865,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I think it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $865,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved back up slightly in price, but Bob is nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting Alice's offer at $880,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  It's a good compromise to secure the product and avoid the risk of losing it entirely."
