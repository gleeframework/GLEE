# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $110. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can save money by trying to negotiate with Alice.  $110 is too close to your limit of $120.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

$105 is still a bit too high. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a little more."
