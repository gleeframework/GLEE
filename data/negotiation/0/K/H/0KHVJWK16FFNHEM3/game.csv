"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. How about $800000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,5,
