{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but it's getting closer. We have several more rounds to negotiate, so let's try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my limit.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and it seems like we're at an impasse. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
