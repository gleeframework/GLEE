"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still above Bob's budget, and there's room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make this purchase. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, $900,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to get closer to Bob's target price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit higher than his target of $800,000, it's a good deal considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could result in Alice becoming unwilling to sell, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure the product now at a slightly higher price than risk losing the opportunity."
