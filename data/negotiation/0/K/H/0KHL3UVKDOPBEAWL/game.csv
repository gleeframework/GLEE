"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make this purchase. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,
