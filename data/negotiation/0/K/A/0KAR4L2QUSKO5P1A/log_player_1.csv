Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for concessions. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,000,000, I aim to set a high anchor in Bob's mind, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for proceeding with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for this product.  I believe this price is still fair given its potential value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, and it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss ($300,000).  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while staying firmly above my $1,500,000 floor.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value, I aim to steer Bob away from his initial lowball offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $600,000 gap between our offers allows for further bargaining without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,800,000, but it's still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the value you've put on the product and my maximum budget. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed offer. There's no strategic advantage to further negotiation or holding out for a potentially higher offer from Bob. Accepting his offer secures the sale at my desired minimum price."
