"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, Bob has two options: 

* **Continue negotiating:**  This could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal or becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget. 

Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of getting the product at his desired price from John, Bob chooses to buy from John."
