"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to pay a fair price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's try to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
