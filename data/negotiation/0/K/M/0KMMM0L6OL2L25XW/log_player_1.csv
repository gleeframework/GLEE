Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial asking price, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
