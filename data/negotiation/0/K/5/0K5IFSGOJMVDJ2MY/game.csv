"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget and I need to make sure it fits within my means.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,
