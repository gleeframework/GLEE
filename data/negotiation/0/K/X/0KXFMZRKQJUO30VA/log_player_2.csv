"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny. Considering its worth to you and its intrinsic value, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its market value and your perceived value, aiming to ensure both parties benefit. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and you have a backup option with John at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. If she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John."
