"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $12000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to pay $13500 for the product?",13500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $12750 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Would you consider $13000 as a final compromise?  I'm not sure I can go lower.",13000.0,Alice,5,
