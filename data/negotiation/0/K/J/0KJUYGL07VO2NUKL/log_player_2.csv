You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above my budget. I want to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's offer, aiming to meet halfway. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  We can then see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and $10,800 is within my budget. While I could try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John or having to go through more rounds isn't worth it.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
