"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more agreeable price. However, $1,400,000 is still a significant leap from my initial offer.  To be realistic, I'm thinking closer to $950,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing the need for a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,000,000.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but $1,250,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product. This represents my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer considering the market value and my own financial considerations. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
