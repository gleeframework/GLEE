"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,
