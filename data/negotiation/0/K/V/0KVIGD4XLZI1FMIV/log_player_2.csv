Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential return on investment.

However, to be totally transparent,  anything much above $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I also have budget limitations.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. It seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,500,000.
