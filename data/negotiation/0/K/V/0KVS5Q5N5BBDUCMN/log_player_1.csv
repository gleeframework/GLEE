Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 with John. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I'm hoping Bob values the product even higher than $1,500,000 and is willing to pay it.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While I'm taking a risk that Bob might reject the offer, the potential for a higher profit outweighs that risk. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** A high starting price gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still having a backup buyer in John."
