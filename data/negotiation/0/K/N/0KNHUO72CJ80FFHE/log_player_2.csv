"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still above your maximum. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering is the logical first step.**  This allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the best move yet.**  You haven't explored Alice's willingness to negotiate, and you may be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Starting with your maximum price sets a clear boundary and shows Alice you're serious about saving money.
* **Knowing John's Price:**  You're using John as a benchmark to ensure you don't overpay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is your limit, you're leaving a little space for Alice to come down a bit without feeling like she's losing too much."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction, but still above your limit.**  While $1,150,000 is closer to your target, you're still not there.
* **Continuing to negotiate is the best choice.**  You want to keep pushing for a lower price and see how much Alice is willing to budge.
* **Buying from John is still on the table, but not yet necessary.**  You haven't completely exhausted Alice's willingness to negotiate, and you may be able to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of jumping back to your initial offer, a small increase shows you're willing to compromise but also that you're serious about saving.
* **Staying within your budget:**  $1,050,000 is still within your maximum, and allows for some potential room for negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's willingness to compromise:**  This counteroffer tests whether Alice is willing to meet you halfway, or if she's set on a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your limit:** While Alice is coming down, $1,125,000 is still more than your maximum price.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have several rounds left, so you can continue to negotiate without a huge risk.
* **Building towards a compromise:** By rejecting and counteroffering, you're demonstrating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price, which could lead Alice to make a more favorable offer.
* **Buying from John is always a fallback option.**  You haven't ruled it out completely, but you're still aiming for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Getting closer to your target:** $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's a significant step closer and signals your willingness to negotiate.
* **Creating pressure:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or make a final counteroffer.  If she rejects, you'll be in a strong position in the next round.
* **Leaving room for a deal:**  You're still leaving some wiggle room for Alice to come down further, but you're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit.**  While it's closer, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.
* **More rounds left:** With several rounds remaining, you have time to continue negotiating without feeling pressured.
* **Building momentum:** By continuing to reject and counteroffer, you're demonstrating your commitment to finding a lower price and increasing the pressure on Alice.
* **John is a backup option:**  You haven't exhausted all options with Alice, so buying from John isn't necessary yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet Alice halfway while staying within your budget. It's a significant drop from Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to close the deal.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only two rounds left, it's time to make a decisive move and see if Alice is willing to accept a price closer to your target.
* **Risk Assessment:** While there's still a chance Alice might reject this offer, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  If she rejects, you'll likely have to buy from John, which is your backup option.
* **Seeking a Balanced Outcome:** This counteroffer offers a compromise that benefits both parties. You'll save money, and Alice will get a price closer to her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit.** Even though it's dropped slightly, you're only one round away from having to buy from John, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.
* **John is a guaranteed deal.** You know you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your target price.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer, and you may end up paying more than necessary.
* **Time is running out.** With only one round left, it's better to secure the product at your maximum price than risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. 
* **The risk of another round:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice means there's a chance she could make a counteroffer higher than $1,100,000, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John anyway.

By buying from John, you ensure you get the product at your target price, even if it means ending the negotiation with Alice.  It's a smart move to secure the deal and avoid further risk."
