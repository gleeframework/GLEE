"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $1,300,000 is too high, and while buying from John is an option, it's best to see if Bob can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better offer than the initial one, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not there yet with $1,150,000. How about $1,050,000? It's a good compromise and closer to the value I see in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but the gap is still significant. To show my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,125,000.  However, I need to see a more substantial move from your end to justify going any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but Bob wants to try and push for a lower price.  While $1,125,000 is better than Alice's previous offers, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. Rejecting this offer gives Bob another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $1,100,000? This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
