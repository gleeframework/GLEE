"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness and provides insight into his negotiating strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I won't let the negotiations with Bob drag on if they don't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, Bob's offer is considerably lower than my initial ask and still leaves a substantial gap to his perceived value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but still holds firm to a price significantly above my minimum.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  By splitting the difference between our previous offers, I signal flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin. 
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds, but I want to guide the negotiation towards a close sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not there yet with $1,150,000. How about $1,050,000? It's a good compromise and closer to the value I see in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my range, but the increments are small.  I need to signal that I'm looking for a more substantial jump to close the deal. By rejecting this offer, I maintain pressure and reiterate the product's higher value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but the gap is still significant. To show my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,125,000.  However, I need to see a more substantial move from your end to justify going any lower."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Condition:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to signal that I'm reaching the lower end of my acceptable range. 
* **Clear Expectation:** By stating that I need a ""more substantial move,"" I emphasize that Bob's incremental increases won't suffice to close the deal.
* **Urgency:**  We're past the halfway point, and I need to push for a significant development in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $1,100,000? This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a very good profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price and a substantial gain from John's offer.
* **Deal Momentum:** Bob's message indicates a stronger commitment to closing the deal, and his increase, while not huge, shows movement in the right direction. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more risks a potentially larger profit, but it also increases the chance of the negotiation stalling completely.  Securing a great deal now outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal later."
