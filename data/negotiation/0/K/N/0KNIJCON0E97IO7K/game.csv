"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without having to go through the hassle of finding another buyer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
