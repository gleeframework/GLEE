I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  This is to give myself room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  It's a risky strategy, but it could pay off.  I'll need to see Bob's reaction to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum value. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and find a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $15,000.  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  If that fails, I'll sell to John."

I'm taking a slight risk here by lowering my price again.  It's my last offer before I'm prepared to settle with John. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to agree to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  His offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  While I'd prefer to make more, it's better to secure a sale than risk getting nothing at all."
