{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate and leaves potential for a deal that's still profitable for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and enthusiastic. I want to pique Bob's interest and make him feel like he's getting a good deal, even if the price is a bit high.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my floor of $15,000, but I'm open to negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to negotiate more aggressively.
* **Flexibility:**  I'll be prepared to either accept a counteroffer from Bob or make a new counteroffer, depending on his response and my assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates that he is interested in the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 allows me to be patient and hold out for a better offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll likely propose a price in the $13,000 - $14,000 range, aiming to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good deal on this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $13,500.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but is still lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us. This helps create a sense of collaboration and hopefully makes Bob feel more comfortable negotiating.
* **Focus on the product:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing its ""amazing"" qualities. This subtly reinforces the idea that the price is justified.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
