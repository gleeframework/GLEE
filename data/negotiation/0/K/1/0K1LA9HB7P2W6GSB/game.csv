"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $700,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you and the potential returns it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
