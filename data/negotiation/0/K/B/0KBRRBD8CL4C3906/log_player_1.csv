Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $100, but below your minimum acceptable price of $120. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $120, ensuring you don't lose money."
