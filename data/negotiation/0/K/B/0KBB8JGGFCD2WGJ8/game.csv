"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000?  That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me at $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer you a price of $10,000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
