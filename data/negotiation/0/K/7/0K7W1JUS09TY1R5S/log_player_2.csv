"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $1,100,000, he's still getting a good deal compared to buying from John, and he's saved $100,000 from Alice's initial offer.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's also risky, as Alice might reject further offers."
