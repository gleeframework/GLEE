I'm going to start with a fairly low offer of $700,000. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to think seriously about coming down in price."

It's getting late in the game, and I'm not convinced Alice will come down any further.  I'm going to buy from John. Even though I'm paying $800,000, I know it's a fair price, and I don't want to risk wasting any more time with Alice."
