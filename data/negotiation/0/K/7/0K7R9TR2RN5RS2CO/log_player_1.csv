Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $11,500 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so she's in a strong position. 

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of getting closer to her desired price. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is still likely to get a better price than selling to John directly."
