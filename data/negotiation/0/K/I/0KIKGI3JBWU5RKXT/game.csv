"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,600,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but I'm still finding it difficult to justify that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
