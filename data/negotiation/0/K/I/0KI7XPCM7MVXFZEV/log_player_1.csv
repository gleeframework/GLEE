"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's a good deal considering the time constraint and the risk of losing the sale altogether."
