"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little high for me. How would you feel about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
