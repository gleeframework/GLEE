"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $110? That's the absolute highest I can go.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little high for my budget. I'm happy to pay $115, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $120. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $118. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",118.0,Alice,5,
