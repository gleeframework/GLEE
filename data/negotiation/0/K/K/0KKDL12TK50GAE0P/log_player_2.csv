"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $100 is significantly lower than what I need to get, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as John is offering the product for your desired price."
