"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $100 is significantly lower than what I need to get, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $130 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $110. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
