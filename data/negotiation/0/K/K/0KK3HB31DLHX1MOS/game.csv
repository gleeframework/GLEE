"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value and our current negotiation. Let's try to close this deal, I'm eager to get this product.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $887,500 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I could buy it from John for less.  I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",850000.0,Bob,8,
