Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $85."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $82 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not very profitable. Considering that John is offering $80, it's more sensible to sell to John and avoid further negotiations. I can always try to sell to Bob again in the future if the opportunity arises."
