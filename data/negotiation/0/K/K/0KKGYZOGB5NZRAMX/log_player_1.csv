Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,150,000? This would allow me to make a more feasible decision.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
