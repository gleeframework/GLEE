"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $11,750. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $11,000. My revised offer is $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I know we're both trying to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to stay closer to my target price. My revised offer is $11,800. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I can tell we're both serious about getting this deal done.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $11,100. I think that's a fair compromise.",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,100 and my previous offer of $11,800. My revised offer is $11,450. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",11450.0,Alice,9,
