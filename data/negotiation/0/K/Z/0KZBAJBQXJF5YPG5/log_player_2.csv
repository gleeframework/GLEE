"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer."
