"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. You can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than John's price, and closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
