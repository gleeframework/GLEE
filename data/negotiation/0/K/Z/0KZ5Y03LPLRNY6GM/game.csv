"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it for $11,500.  This price still allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500.  Would that be feasible?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to go that far.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
