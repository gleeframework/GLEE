"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value for that price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $14,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly aiming for a profit, and I have a $1,000 buffer before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could you do $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming slightly above Alice's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for further negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my price limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer sets a good starting point. Even if Alice rejects it, we have ground to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Alice is meeting me almost exactly in the middle. This price is a good compromise, saving me $1,750 compared to John's offer. There's a slight chance I could push for a tiny bit more, but the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
