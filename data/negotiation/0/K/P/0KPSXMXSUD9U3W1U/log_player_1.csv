Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so a price of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  Your minimum is $15,000, so you are willing to compromise a bit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a reasonable price to start the negotiation and see if Bob is interested.

This offer is a good starting point.  We can adjust it based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer of $11,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and also below the initial offer I made.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially getting a better deal.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative:**  I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000 with John. This option is always available if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair price.
* **Remaining above my minimum:** $13,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so it's a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I've included a message inviting Bob to continue the conversation, indicating that I'm flexible and open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12800? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $12,800 is only slightly below my minimum value of $15,000, it's still a significant difference. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  Bob has already indicated that $12,800 is his final offer.  Continuing the negotiation would likely result in further price reductions, potentially below my minimum.
* **Selling to John offers a guaranteed profit:**  John is offering me $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer and meets my minimum.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John, rather than risking a lower price with Bob."
