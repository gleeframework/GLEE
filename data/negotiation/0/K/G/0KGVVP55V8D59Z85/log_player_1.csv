Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The range where a deal can happen is between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer.  Your goal is to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum without pushing him away completely.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and the high demand, I'm offering it at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Confident Tone:** The message highlights the product's value and demand, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to move from your $1,100,000 price."
