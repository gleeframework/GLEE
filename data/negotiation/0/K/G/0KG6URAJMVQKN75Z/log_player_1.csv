Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you, for $950,000."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $950,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still making it very attractive for Bob to accept rather than risk missing out. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
