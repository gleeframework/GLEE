Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
