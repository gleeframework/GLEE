"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000?  This is a very valuable product, and I believe this price is still fair.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I still can't agree to that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a very fair price, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
