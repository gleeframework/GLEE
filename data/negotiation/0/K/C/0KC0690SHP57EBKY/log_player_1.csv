Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120. By offering it at $119, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving Bob with a slight incentive to buy ($1 gain). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
