"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the price as low as possible, so we start with a significantly lower counteroffer than our actual limit. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a polite and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. We also express continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to work with us.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:**  We don't reveal our absolute maximum price ($80) just yet. This gives us some flexibility in future rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $100 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $80. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** We're getting closer to our limit, so we're now being more direct about our desired price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating we're ""ready to buy right now,"" we add a bit of urgency and hopefully encourage Alice to accept.
* **Final Offer (To Alice):**  This is our maximum price, matching John's offer. If Alice rejects this, we'll go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go down to $80. Her latest offer of $110 is still considerably higher.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  We have a guaranteed option with John at $80. It makes no sense to pay more when we can get the product for our target price elsewhere. 
* **Time to Move On:** Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a satisfactory outcome."
