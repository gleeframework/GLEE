"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given my own assessment of its value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. This product offers significant untapped potential, which my initial offer reflects. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget. While it's a lower price than the first offer, it's still a considerable gap. Bob can continue negotiating to get a better price, or he can choose to buy from John at a guaranteed lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for continued negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to accept a compromise.  My final offer is $975,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal. Bob can potentially negotiate further and get a lower price, especially since Alice has said this is her ""final offer."" If negotiations fail, Bob has the option of buying from John for a guaranteed $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair and realistic price that reflects both of our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 925000}
