"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given my own assessment of its value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. This product offers significant untapped potential, which my initial offer reflects. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of what's on the table.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for continued negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to accept a compromise.  My final offer is $975,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair and realistic price that reflects both of our perspectives.",925000.0,Bob,6,
