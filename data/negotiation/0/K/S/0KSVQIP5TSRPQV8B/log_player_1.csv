"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my range, but I'm really interested in the product.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm serious about buying it, but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for my desired price, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I still have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for my desired price. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget.  How about $9,750?  That's a solid price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
