"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my range, but I'm really interested in the product.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm serious about buying it, but need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget.  How about $9,750?  That's a solid price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's a price that allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal now.",10250.0,Alice,7,
