"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. Since Bob has 10 rounds, he has time to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my range, but I'm really interested in the product.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm serious about buying it, but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his budget. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can leverage the fact that Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob still wants to try and get a better price.  He's already gotten Alice to budge from $12,000 to $10,000. There are still 5 rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  If Bob doesn't get a better deal, he can always buy from John in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget.  How about $9,750?  That's a solid price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's a price that allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a while, and while Alice has come down significantly, she's still above Bob's budget. There are only 3 rounds left, and the risk is that Alice might not be willing to go lower. Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget and allows him to finalize the deal."
