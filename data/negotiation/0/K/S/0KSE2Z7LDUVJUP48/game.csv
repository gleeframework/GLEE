"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $725,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to settle at $690,000?",690000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $690,000. I'm thinking of a price of $715,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I want to close this deal. How about we split the difference and agree on $707,500?",707500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $707,500. I'm thinking of a price of $712,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",712500.0,Alice,7,
