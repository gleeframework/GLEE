Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $900,000 offer. He's shown a consistent pattern of incremental increases.  While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the difference is unlikely to outweigh the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
