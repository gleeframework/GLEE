"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Would you be willing to consider that?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $13,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,375? This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",13375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,375 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,300, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $13,300 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time at $13,350. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",13350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,350. I'm willing to go up to $13,325, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1325.0,Bob,8,
