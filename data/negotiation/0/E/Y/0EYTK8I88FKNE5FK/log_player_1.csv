"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, and I'm offering the product for $10,500. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a cycle of increasingly small price changes.  John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
