"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still leaving room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to your final offer and still within my spending limit.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $920,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to earn a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $910,000. This is my final compromise.",910000.0,Alice,7,
