"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,012,500?  This offer is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs. Let me know what you think.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that. While $1,012,500 is a fair offer, I have a hard limit at $1,000,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I understand and will have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
