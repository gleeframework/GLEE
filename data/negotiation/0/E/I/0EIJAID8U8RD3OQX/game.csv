"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great product that I know you'll appreciate, so let's try to reach a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and find a solution we're both happy with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,
