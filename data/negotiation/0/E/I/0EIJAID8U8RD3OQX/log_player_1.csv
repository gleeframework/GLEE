Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great product that I know you'll appreciate, so let's try to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and find a solution we're both happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant drop from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a fair price and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  It also allows me to close the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities."
