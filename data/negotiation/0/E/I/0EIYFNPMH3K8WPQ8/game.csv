"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is far too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
