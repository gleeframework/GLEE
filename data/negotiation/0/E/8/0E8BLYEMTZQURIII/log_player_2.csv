Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and you're still $150,000 below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower. While we could try for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll hold firm and we'll end up with a worse deal or have to go with John at the full $1,000,000. Accepting $700,000 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
