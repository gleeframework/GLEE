Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be confident and show that I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is tempting, it's simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise that still leaves me a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm also using a friendly tone in my message to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $90, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to consider. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your offer, $85 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a significant reduction from my original asking price, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is another compromise, but it brings me closer to my desired price of $120.  I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making to make the offer more appealing. I'm also reminding him of my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $92.50, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to go with John's offer of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob and have made several compromises, Bob's final offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's important to remember that I have a backup offer from John that guarantees my minimum desired profit."
