"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $800,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still a bit under my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $820,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. Would you be willing to close the deal at $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",810000.0,Alice,7,
