Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and we're running out of rounds. While we could push for a lower price, the risk of her walking away and us having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting $810,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
