"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would work for me at $5,000.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I could consider $6,500. I need to be mindful of my budget.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price point. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12,000 is still above what I can justify.  My absolute limit is $7,000. If that's not workable, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,
