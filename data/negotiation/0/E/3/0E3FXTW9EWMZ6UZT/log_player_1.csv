"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart in our valuations.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12,000 is still above what I can justify.  My absolute limit is $7,000. If that's not workable, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob is not budging significantly towards a reasonable price. It's clear that his valuation is far too low. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss. It's time to cut the negotiation short and move on to the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
