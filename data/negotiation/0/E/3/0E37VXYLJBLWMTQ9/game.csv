"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of offering $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair value.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a significant reduction from my original price and still allows me to maintain a healthy margin. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
