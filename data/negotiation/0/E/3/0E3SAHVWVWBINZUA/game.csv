"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, given the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
