Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair value, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for you, given the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum price, and it's the same as what John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate and risking getting a lower price, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
