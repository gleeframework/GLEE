"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing Bob values the product at $120. This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired $150 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $130 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $140? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $140. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $135 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds. I believe I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. How about $140? It's a fair compromise that keeps the value of the product in mind."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. I've shown flexibility by moving from $150 to $140, and Bob's offer hasn't moved much. I believe repeating my counteroffer will demonstrate my firmness and potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $132 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds. I believe I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about the budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $136? This would give us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 136}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $136, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's desire for a compromise, which could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, and only 2 rounds remain. I'm concerned that Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm at risk of ending up with a price that's too low.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John at $150, guaranteeing a profit closer to my desired price."
