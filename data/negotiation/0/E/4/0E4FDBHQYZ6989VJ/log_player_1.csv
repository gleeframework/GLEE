"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm confident in getting at least that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to close the deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I've got 6 rounds left and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,500. This is a small compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to accept. We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to avoid going back and forth for too many more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. This is a good price, and I'm happy with it."
