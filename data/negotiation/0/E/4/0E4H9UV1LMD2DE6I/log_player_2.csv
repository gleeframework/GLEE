"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $85 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $80 he can get from John. There's a chance that Alice might come down further, but with 5 rounds remaining, it's a gamble.  It's more reliable to buy from John and secure the product at a price Bob is comfortable with."
