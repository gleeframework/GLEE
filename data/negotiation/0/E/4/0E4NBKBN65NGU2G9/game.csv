"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $900,000 either. I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe $900,000 is a fair reflection of its worth, I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $875,000, so I'll offer $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
