"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves me with a comfortable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  While Alice's offer is below your maximum, there's still room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is a fair offer, I need a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down slightly, it's still not ideal.  There's still a gap between her offer and your target price. You should continue negotiating to try and squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a good compromise, and allows us both to get closer to our target prices. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
