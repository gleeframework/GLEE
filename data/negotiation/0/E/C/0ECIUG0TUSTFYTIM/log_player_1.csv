"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it!  I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message upbeat and focused on the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, which will allow for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **I have more leverage:** I know John is willing to pay $100, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer, making it a better deal for him. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and open to finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John is a safer bet:** I have a guaranteed $100 from John.  There's a chance I could get a better price from Bob, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal from Bob increases."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $75 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go to $80?  That's a fair price for both of us and would let us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my bottom line.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm trying to make this a final offer, subtly putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
