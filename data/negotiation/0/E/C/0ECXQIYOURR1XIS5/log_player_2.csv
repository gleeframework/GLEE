"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $15,000.**  
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  
* **Buying from John is a last resort, as it's the most expensive option.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's product is worth $12,000 to her.** This is a good starting point for a counteroffer.
* **Offering $12,500 gives Alice a $500 profit.** This is a reasonable margin that might make her accept.
* **It's still significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000.**  This gives you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $15,000.**
* **Rejecting gives you the opportunity to counteroffer again and try to get closer to your desired price.**
* **Buying from John is still the least desirable option, as it's the most expensive.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between her previous offer and your previous offer.
* **This gives Alice a $1,000 profit**, which is still a decent margin for her.
* **It's still below your maximum price of $15,000.**  This keeps you within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price but still above it.**  
* **I've already made two counteroffers and Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $13,800.**
* **Buying from John is the safer option.** It's still within my budget and avoids further negotiations with Alice, who seems unwilling to compromise."
