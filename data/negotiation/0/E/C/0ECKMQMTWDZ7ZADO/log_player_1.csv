Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 to guarantee a sale, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed selling point ($150) creates a sense of urgency and a perception of a good deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

It's important to note that this is a starting point. How Bob responds might lead to further adjustments in my approach."
