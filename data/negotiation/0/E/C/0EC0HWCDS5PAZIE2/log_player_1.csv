"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting high, we can gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give us insight into his perceived value of the product and his willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000). This knowledge gives us leverage and allows us to be more assertive in our initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  We'll counter in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest, that price undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're making a significant move from our initial offer, coming down $150,000 to show flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still aiming high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob.
* **Time Consideration:** We're aware of the 10-round limit.  By making a substantial move early on, we aim to accelerate the negotiation process and reach a mutually beneficial agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his offer is getting closer to our acceptable range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting $1,700,000 at this stage might leave money on the table. We still have negotiating power and time to try and secure a higher price.
* **Calculated Risk:** While we risk John's offer by continuing, the potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a way to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,775,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done."",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,775,000, we're splitting the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,700,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,850,000). This signals fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By using phrases like ""let's close this deal"" and ""commitment to getting this done,"" we inject a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** We're still well above our minimum selling point, ensuring a substantial profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,725,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has increased his offer and stated this is his ""final offer."" While it might not be truly final, it suggests he is very serious and unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,725,000 is still a significant profit over our minimum and John's offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing carries the risk that Bob will walk away, leaving us to settle for John's lower offer. Accepting now minimizes this risk."
