"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. My initial asking price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,350,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
