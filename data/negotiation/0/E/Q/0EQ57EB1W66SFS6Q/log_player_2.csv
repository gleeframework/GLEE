"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a bit better for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $760,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for both sides at this point. Getting the product for $795,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer, and Alice is getting a price close to her own valuation.  There's a risk Alice might go even lower in further rounds, but it's getting close to a point where it's not worth the additional risk of losing the deal altogether."
