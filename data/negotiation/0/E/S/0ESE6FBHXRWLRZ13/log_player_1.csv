Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product's value to Bob is $1,000,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" without explicitly stating what that value *is* to Bob.  This encourages him to focus on his own perceived value, which might be higher than $1,000,000.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, ensuring I don't lose money."
