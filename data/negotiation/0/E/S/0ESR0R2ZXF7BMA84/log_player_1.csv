Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $80. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
