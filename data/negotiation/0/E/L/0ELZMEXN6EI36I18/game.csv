"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you at $800,000, but I'll throw in some additional value-added services worth $20,000. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits to help you get the most out of it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
