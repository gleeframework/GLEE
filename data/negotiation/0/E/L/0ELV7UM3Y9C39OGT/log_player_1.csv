Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Open Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By offering a higher price and using a friendly approach, I'm hoping to pique Bob's interest and get the negotiation started. I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to no sale."
