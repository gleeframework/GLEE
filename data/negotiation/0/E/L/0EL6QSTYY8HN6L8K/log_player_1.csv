Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I make a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
