"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While the product is worth $15,000 to you, Alice's offer of $14,000 allows you to purchase it at a $1,000 discount. This is a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
