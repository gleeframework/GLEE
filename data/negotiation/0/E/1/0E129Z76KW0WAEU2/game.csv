"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1500000.  This represents a fair value considering my current market research.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to go slightly below your offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This price reflects the value I see in your product while still staying within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $1650000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1625000 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1625000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1637500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1637500.0,Alice,7,
