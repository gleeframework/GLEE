Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and what John is offering. While I want to find an agreement with Bob, accepting such a low price in the second round is not a good strategy.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider  $1,600,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I recognize the product's value,  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob. It's more than I would get from John.
