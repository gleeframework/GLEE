"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. We believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to work with us. However, we're still a bit apart on the price. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at a price of $1050000. We believe this is a fair compromise that still allows us to make a reasonable profit. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high for you. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have more rounds to go. You can try a counteroffer closer to your desired price point to see if you can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to move closer to our asking price. However, we're still not quite there yet. After further consideration, we're willing to offer the product at a price of $1050000, which is the same as our previous offer. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and our costs. If you're willing to meet us at this price, we're open to negotiating further. Otherwise, we'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stood firm at $1,050,000, and it's clear that we're not going to budge on price. We've already rejected her previous offer of $1,050,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's risky to keep negotiating. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. While this is slightly above your initial goal, it's still a significantly better deal than Alice's final offer."
