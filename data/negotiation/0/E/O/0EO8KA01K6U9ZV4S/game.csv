,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to meet you at $115. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus for you, which will make the total value of the deal worth $122. Would you be interested in that?",122.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus you're offering, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $122. I'm willing to consider the deal, but I'd like to get the price down to $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,8,
