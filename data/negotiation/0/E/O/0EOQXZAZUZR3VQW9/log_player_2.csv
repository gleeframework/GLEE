"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your operations and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than $1,500,000.
* **You still get a good deal:**  While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you can buy it for $1,200,000, saving you $300,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial decision."
