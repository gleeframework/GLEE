**Why This Strategy?**

This strategy aims to:

# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $900000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.

* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm aiming for the best possible outcome, and a little more negotiation might get me closer to $1 million.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge how flexible Bob is.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers you, while allowing for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, even though I'm lowering my price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a mutually beneficial deal, aiming to keep negotiations positive.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a significant concession but still keeps the price above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Building Pressure:**  By demonstrating willingness to negotiate, I'm subtly building pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 
* **Maintaining Control:** This counteroffer gives me more control over the negotiation and keeps me in a favorable position."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000? This would represent a significant saving for me while still giving you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still slightly below what I'm hoping for.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left.  

**Strategy:**

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm not willing to settle yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to $950,000, showing I'm flexible but not ready to concede too much.
* **Value Justification:** I'll emphasize the product's value to Bob to reinforce my asking price."
