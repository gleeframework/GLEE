"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1000000. I believe it has tremendous value for someone in your position. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since my maximum budget is $1,200,000, there's a chance I can get the product for less. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers you, while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get it for less. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This would represent a significant saving for me while still giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down slightly to $940000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's unique value and potential benefits to your business.  I'm confident you'll find this investment to be very worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $940,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer. This is a decent compromise and getting closer to my goal of a price under $950,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely the price won't drop much further, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price within my budget."
