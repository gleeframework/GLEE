Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can meet Bob somewhere in the middle."

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

We're getting close, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  We have time to negotiate and John's offer provides a solid backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately reflects the product's value and our previous discussions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise a bit more but also establishes a firm stance.  
* **Time Constraint:**  Mentioning ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and limits the negotiation going in circles.
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob why he was initially interested and willing to pay above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could likely negotiate a slightly higher price, the gains would be minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,220,000 is a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,000,000. It's better to secure a good deal now.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation means tying up the product longer. Accepting now allows us to move on and potentially pursue other opportunities."
