Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal will require compromise or creativity.

**Strategies**

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation to try and shift his perception of value. This could lead to him countering closer to your desired range.

2. **Value Justification:** If you have any information about why the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to Bob (even if it's not worth that objectively), you can use that to justify a higher price.

**The Offer**

Since there is no ZOPA based on the given information, securing a deal with Bob will require him to re-evaluate the product's worth to him.  Therefore, focusing on a high anchor strategy with strong justification is key.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Its unique features and market potential place its value well above typical valuations. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let's discuss how this asset can transform your operations and find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:**  The $1,800,000 starting point aims to reset Bob's expectations.
* **Value-Focused Language:** The message emphasizes ""unique features,"" ""market potential,"" and ""significant returns"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""find a mutually beneficial arrangement"" signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:** This strategy doesn't guarantee a deal with Bob. He might outright reject the offer. However, it gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit if he's willing to reconsider the product's value to him."
