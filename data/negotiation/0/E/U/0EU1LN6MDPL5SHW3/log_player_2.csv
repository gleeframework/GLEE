"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential returns. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still a gap between your price and hers.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm firmly set on my previous offer of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and my current financial capacity. If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
