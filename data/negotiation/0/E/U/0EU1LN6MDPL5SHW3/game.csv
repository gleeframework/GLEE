"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not comfortable going beyond this price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential returns. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm firmly set on my previous offer of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and my current financial capacity. If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
