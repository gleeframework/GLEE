"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,150,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to get a good deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
