``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving you some room to potentially negotiate upwards. However, it's also close enough to Bob's value that it's likely he'll be willing to at least consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?
