{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us a starting point for negotiations.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.  Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at our desired price gives us leverage.  We don't *need* to go below $1,200,000.

**The Offer:**

By offering the product at $1,150,000, we're:

* **Aiming High:** We're seeking a significant profit margin.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** If Bob counters, we can potentially still settle on a price higher than his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Maintaining a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can confidently sell to John at our desired price."
