"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $750,000, which is $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $975,000 gets me the product for $25,000 less than John's offer, which is a decent saving.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely for a potentially small additional discount."
