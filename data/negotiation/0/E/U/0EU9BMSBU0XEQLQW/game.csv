"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is only worth $1,000,000 to me at most. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. While I understand its value, I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $750,000, which is $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
