Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a significant amount:** It shows you value the product and aren't just giving it away.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while leaving space for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your desired price:** While it's above your minimum of $10,000, you want to maximize your earnings.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You have room to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed $10,000 option.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  Since he's already lowered his price, you can try something a bit closer to your initial offer but still below his perceived value.  A counteroffer of $13,500 might be a good starting point."

* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $2,000 below your initial offer and is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has consistently lowered his price, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If you reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and you'll be left with only the option to sell to John for $10,000.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It allows you to secure a sale quickly while still earning a respectable profit."
