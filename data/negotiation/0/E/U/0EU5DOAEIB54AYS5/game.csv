"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $125. Would you be willing to consider it?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think you're a serious buyer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. How about we discuss $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'd like to make a revised offer of $130. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. I'd like to make a revised offer of $132.50. This is my last offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'll make one more concession. I'll meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price, but if you don't accept, I'll have to consider other options.",135.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make one last offer of $130. If you can't meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",130.0,Bob,10,
