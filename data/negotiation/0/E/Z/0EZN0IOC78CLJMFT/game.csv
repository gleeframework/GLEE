"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $930,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,7,
