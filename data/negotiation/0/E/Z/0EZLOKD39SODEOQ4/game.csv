"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise and still leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
