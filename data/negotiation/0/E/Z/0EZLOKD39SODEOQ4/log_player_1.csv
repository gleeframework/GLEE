{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum, but also leaving room for negotiation. It's important to balance maximizing profit with keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise and still leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $120. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
