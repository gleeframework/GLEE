"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
