"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial offer is $900000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and offers you a great opportunity for a significant return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is $100,000 more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $800,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
