Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
