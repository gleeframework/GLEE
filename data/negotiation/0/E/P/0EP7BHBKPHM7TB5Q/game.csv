"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer,  let's make this happen.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider it.",915000.0,Bob,6,
