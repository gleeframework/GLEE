"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a high price. 

If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially increase the final selling price. I'm not willing to settle for the minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my price by $150,000 from the initial offer, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial bid. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I want to see if I can push him higher.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me another opportunity to counter.  I'm also still wary of selling to John for the minimum, as there's a chance I could secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my price again, but only by $100,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while also showing that I'm still holding firm to a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer again, as we are getting closer to a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation with Bob isn't going well. We've reached a point where he's offering less than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a profit and secures a sale.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
