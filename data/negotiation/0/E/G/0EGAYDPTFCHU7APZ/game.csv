"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below my acceptable range. To be honest, I'm very close to accepting John's offer of $800,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you.  Let's meet halfway at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
