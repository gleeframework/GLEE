"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll let you have it for $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,
