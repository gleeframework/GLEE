Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle at $125?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than $100, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll let you have it for $137.50?"", ""product_price"": 137.50}
