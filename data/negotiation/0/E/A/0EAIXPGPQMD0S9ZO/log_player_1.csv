Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, as it's unlikely Bob will immediately accept. I'm hoping to use this as a starting point for negotiation and see if I can get closer to my target price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $100. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. It's a compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still keeping things moving towards a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get $100, Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me. I'm not sure if we can get closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk the negotiations dragging on any longer.  John offers a sure and solid price, and I'll take it."
