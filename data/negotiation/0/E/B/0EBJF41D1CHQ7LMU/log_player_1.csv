Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair return.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 125}

You have three options:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only $120, which is the same as what John would pay, it saves me the time and effort of negotiating further."
