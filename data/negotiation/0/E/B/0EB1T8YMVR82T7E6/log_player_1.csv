"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $12,000, as it's significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is still above my minimum value of $15,000 but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will show I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $15,500. This is only $500 above my minimum value and demonstrates a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $15,000, but with only a few rounds remaining, I'm starting to consider selling to John if I can't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $15,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.  If he rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John."
