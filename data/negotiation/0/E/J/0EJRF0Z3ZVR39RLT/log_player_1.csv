Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob counters. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message subtly hints that the price could be lower than what John is willing to pay, creating a sense of urgency. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
