**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her ($950,000 vs. $800,000), it's still significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,500,000). 
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $550,000 compared to buying from John."
