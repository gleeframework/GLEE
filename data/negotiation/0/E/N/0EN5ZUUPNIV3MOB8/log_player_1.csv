"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while also providing a significant return on your investment. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer ($1,100,000) that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the high price (""unique value and potential""), subtly anchoring the negotiation around the product's benefits to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy balances being assertive with being open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both Bob's perceived value and my initial offer. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about achieving a price closer to the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the market,  I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's true worth and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to the middle ground by suggesting $1,000,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price and shift the focus away from ""market conditions.""
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:**  By positioning the counteroffer as mutually beneficial, I'm encouraging Bob to see it as a collaborative solution rather than a point of contention."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Would you consider $950,000? I believe that's a very competitive offer and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the $1,000,000 I was aiming for, it's still significantly higher than my guaranteed sale price to John ($800,000).  

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Strong Profit:**  $950,000 is a $150,000 profit, which is a great return.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations has a cost. Accepting now means I secure the profit sooner. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Extended negotiations can be draining. It's better to close a good deal than risk things breaking down over a relatively small difference."
