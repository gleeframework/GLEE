"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, but  $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another offer lined up, but I believe in giving you a fair shot. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
