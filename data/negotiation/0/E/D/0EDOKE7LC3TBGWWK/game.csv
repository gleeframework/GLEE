"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
