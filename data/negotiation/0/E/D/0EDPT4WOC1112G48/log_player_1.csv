Even though Bob increased his offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $92.50? That's a very competitive price for this product."", 
""product_price"": 92.50

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than $92.50. How about we try $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's not ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $87.50 is better than risking him walking away and having to settle for John's $80 offer."
