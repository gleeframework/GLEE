Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:**  Mentioning the product's usefulness might sway Bob to pay a bit more. 

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to decide if I want to counter-offer or go with John's guaranteed $120.  I'll base my decision on how confident I am in getting a better price from Bob and how much time I'm willing to invest in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum of $120, so I can't accept it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay something, so there's potential for a compromise.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I know I can get $120 from John, so I don't have to rush into accepting a low offer.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range but still within a reasonable negotiation zone."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $100 doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it's still a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  Staying friendly and open encourages Bob to keep talking.

**Next steps:**

I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. If Bob still says no, I'll need to weigh the potential of getting a higher price with the risk of losing the sale and having to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses down. Could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $105 is still below my minimum of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has already lowered his offer significantly, so further negotiations might be less productive. 
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  I can confidently get $120 from John, giving me a safety net.

**Next steps:**

I'm going to counter-offer Bob one last time, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John. I'll aim for a compromise price that's closer to my desired range but still takes into account Bob's financial limitations. If Bob doesn't budge, it's time to move on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To make this work for both of us, I'd need to stick to $112. It's the absolute lowest I can go, but it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there.  If not, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my last counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still acknowledges Bob's budget.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us, not just about my needs.
* **Setting a deadline:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly suggests that if Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on to John.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John.  I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to secure the sale and maximize my profit."
