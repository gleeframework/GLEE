"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This still leaves room for you to gain significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,025,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good deal on the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
