Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something that can be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is significantly better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This still leaves room for you to gain significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,025,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good deal on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise and significantly closer to my initial offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,100,000,  it's a substantial profit and a good return on investment.  It's also more than the $800,000 I'd get from John.  Accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit at this stage."
