Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $16,000. This is a compromise,  closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept."
