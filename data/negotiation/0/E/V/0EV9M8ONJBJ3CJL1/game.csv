"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $11,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
