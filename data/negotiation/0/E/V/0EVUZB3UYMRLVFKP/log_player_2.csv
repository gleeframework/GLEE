"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs $1,500,000). This suggests there is room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, considering the product's value to me and the market price, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. I'm confident this price is still fair and beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. Considering its value to you and the market price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting her offer at $1,100,000 still saves me a substantial amount compared to buying from John ($400,000). Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
