"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the potential value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This would be a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
