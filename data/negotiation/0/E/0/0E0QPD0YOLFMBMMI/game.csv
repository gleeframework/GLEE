"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can accept. To be honest, I have another potential buyer lined up for $15,000.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that reflects the product's value. Would you consider $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,5,
