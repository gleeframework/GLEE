"Alice, your product seems great, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets both of our needs.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $950000, but that's still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value and that it allows us both to close this deal.  I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking $975000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a fair compromise that should satisfy both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
