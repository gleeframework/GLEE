"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Although I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, Bob's offer is already at my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future rounds, and it's always a risk to continue negotiating.  Selling to Bob now guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
