Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my initial offer, starting slightly higher gives me a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm implying it's a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even though it's just below my minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
