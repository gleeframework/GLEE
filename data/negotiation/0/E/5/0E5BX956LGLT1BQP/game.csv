"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum threshold. I understand we both value this product highly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This price still allows for a significant return on your investment and keeps the deal fair for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,450,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to making this deal work, but $1,325,000 is simply too low. To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price is fair, considering the value of the product, and gives you a great opportunity for a strong return. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,360,000 to meet you closer to the middle.  What do you think?",1360000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts and willingness to compromise. To reach a deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,380,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer and represents a great opportunity for you. Let's finalize this deal.",1380000.0,Alice,7,
