"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $15,000 when you can buy the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is aggressive but gives me room to negotiate.  I'm assuming Alice wants to sell the product and might be willing to come down a bit.  I also need to leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's, but I want to try and get the price down even further. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time I'm going to be more conservative. I'm going to offer $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's offer. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept it."
