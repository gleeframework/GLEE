"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but not too aggressive. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close enough to my minimum and still gives me a small profit. I'm accepting this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potential lower offers."
