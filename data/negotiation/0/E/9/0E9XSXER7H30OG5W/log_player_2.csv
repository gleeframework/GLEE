Alice's offer:

You are still willing to pay less than $112.50, as you are trying to save as much money as possible. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $112.50. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. How about we meet at $111.50?

You have three options:

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $111.50.  While you would prefer to pay less, it's not worth risking losing the deal for a small price difference. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
