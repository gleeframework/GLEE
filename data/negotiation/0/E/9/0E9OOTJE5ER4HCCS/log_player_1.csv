"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit for myself. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $16,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $16,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $18,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have more rounds to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit further to $17,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also maintaining a good profit margin for myself. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $16,500.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $16,500 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance to close a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about $17,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $17,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm emphasizing the ""investment"" aspect to highlight the long-term value of the product and encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile purchase."
