"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a starting point to work with. By starting at a lower price, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still below my maximum budget. This is a compromise, and hopefully, it will encourage Alice to accept or come back with a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my preferred price point. There's still room for negotiation to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. I want to see if I can get her even lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also getting closer to my maximum budget. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm willing to pay a fair price and accept my offer. If she rejects, I'm getting close to the point where I might consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, as I'm not going to get a better price. It's the same price as buying from John, so I might as well accept and close the deal."
