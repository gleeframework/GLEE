"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to me and your cost.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle and go with $9,100?  This price allows both of us to get a good deal, and it's a step closer to finding a solution that works for us both. ",9100.0,Bob,6,
