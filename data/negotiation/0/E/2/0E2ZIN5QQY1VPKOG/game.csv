"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $120 for the product?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $120 is still pushing it.  Could you do $75? That would be a fair deal.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself too. $120 is my absolute lowest price. Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,5,
