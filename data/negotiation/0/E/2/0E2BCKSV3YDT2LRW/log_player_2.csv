"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to save as much money as possible.  $90 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, this time increasing his offer by $5, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a lower price. This amount is closer to Alice's last offer, showing good faith and signaling a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. I'm willing to come down further and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is within Bob's budget and a good price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's risky. There's a chance Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
