Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob room to counteroffer, while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $925,000 is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a reasonable compromise and gets me closer to my minimum goal. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal without risking losing out on any potential future opportunities."
