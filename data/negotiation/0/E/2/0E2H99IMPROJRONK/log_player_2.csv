Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.
