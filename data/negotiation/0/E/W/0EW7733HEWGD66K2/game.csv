"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your desired selling price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
