Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and leaves Bob with the impression you might be willing to settle lower. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and what his negotiation strategy might be. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone higher. If he rejects it, you can start working your way down towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:** Keep in mind you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge empowers you to walk away from any deal with Bob that doesn't meet your minimum needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $15,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $15,000 matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob countered higher than his initial statement of $10,000, indicating he's willing to go higher to secure the product. I'll aim for a price closer to $17,000-$18,000 before accepting his offer or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is quite high. Could we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise, which can be persuasive.
* **Staying Firm:** While moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still aiming for a significantly higher price than his initial $15,000.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves some space for further negotiation if Bob pushes back, allowing me to potentially settle around $16,000-$17,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $15,000 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $15,000, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  Accepting his offer now secures the same price John is offering, preventing the risk of a stalemate and potentially losing both buyers."
