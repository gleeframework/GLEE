"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is as close to our initial meeting price as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
