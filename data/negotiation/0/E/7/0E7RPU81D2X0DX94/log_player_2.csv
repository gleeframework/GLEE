This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $9,200, a saving of $2,800 from your maximum budget and a good reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price or the deal falling through, forcing you to buy from John at the full $12,000."
