{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always worth exploring other options before accepting the initial offer.  Since Bob has a limit of $1,500,000, Alice's offer is at the maximum. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower the price.  Negotiating could potentially save Bob some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer starts at a significantly lower price. This is a bold move, but it's a common strategy to establish a starting point for negotiation and see if Alice is willing to budge.  It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but this sets the stage for a potential compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, which is a positive sign.  However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's still worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down even further.  There's a chance Bob can get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

{""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**
