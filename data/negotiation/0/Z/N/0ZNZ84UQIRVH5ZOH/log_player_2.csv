"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A $7,500 offer is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her valuation of $12,000. This counteroffer tests the waters and provides room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to her initial offer of $9,000. While buying from John for $8,000 would be even cheaper, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is present.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product and minimizes the chance of losing the opportunity."
