Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200? I think that's as low as I can go while still making it worth my while. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,100 is still a bit of a compromise for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $7,150? I think that's the best I can do without losing money on the deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $7,100 and is meeting in the middle for a final offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better price and risking going over $8,000 with another counteroffer isn't worth it."
