"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200? I think that's as low as I can go while still making it worth my while. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $7,200 is still a little higher than I'd like. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,100? That would work well for me.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,100 is still a bit of a compromise for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $7,150? I think that's the best I can do without losing money on the deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",7150.0,Alice,7,
