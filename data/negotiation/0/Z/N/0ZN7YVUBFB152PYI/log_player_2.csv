Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $1300000 is a decent offer, it's a bit too low for me at this point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. Your offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $1340000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win situation.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is now below your target price of $1,350,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you've already achieved a good discount compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's a good time to close the deal to avoid potentially risking a higher price or losing the opportunity entirely."
