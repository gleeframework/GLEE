"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's try to reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close! I can see you're willing to go up to $105, but I'm not sure I can go that low. How about we meet at $112? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $108?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $112, which would be $110. I think that's the best price I can offer.",110.0,Alice,7,
