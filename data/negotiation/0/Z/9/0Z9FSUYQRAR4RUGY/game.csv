"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your initial offer, so how about $975,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $1,012,500? This price is more in line with the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,012,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,6,
