"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9000. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $9000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your offer. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
