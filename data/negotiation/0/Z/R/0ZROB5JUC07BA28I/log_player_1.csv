"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price early on. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $120.  I'll counter again, but I'm running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

This is my final attempt to get a higher price from Bob. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left, the risk of getting a lower price than John's offer is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $120."
