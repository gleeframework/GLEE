# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,100,000 is still above my target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John remains a backup:**  If I can't get a better deal from Alice, I have John as a fallback option."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for us both. I'm willing to come down slightly further.  How about we settle at $1,090,000? This reflects my desire to close this deal while still valuing the product fairly.

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,090,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe we can reach a price closer to my target.
