Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its potential value to you, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could start higher, a price too close to $1,200,000 might discourage Bob from engaging in negotiations at all. 

This approach balances ambition with a strategic understanding of negotiation dynamics."
