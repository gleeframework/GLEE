"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is far too high for me. I'm only interested in paying a maximum of $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $1500000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget for this product remains at $800000.  Let's work towards finding a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I understand his budget limitations, I cannot sell the product for $800,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge your efforts to compromise, $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my maximum offer of $800000.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions, and it seems we're at an impasse.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
