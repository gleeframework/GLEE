{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth $850,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, which may motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant discount, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our negotiation,  $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
