"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit below my minimum acceptable value to give Bob some room to negotiate.  This should encourage him to make a counteroffer, which will give me a chance to gauge his interest and potentially get closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking for a price closer to $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd like to close the deal, it's too early to accept such a low price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price that's still a fair distance from Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial price. This shows flexibility, while still aiming for a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to purchase the product, I can only agree to a price of $90. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm going to offer $100, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I am willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to give away the product at a price that's too low for me.  I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can reach an agreement at $95. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable value. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle, and John's offer is still available if this falls through.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
