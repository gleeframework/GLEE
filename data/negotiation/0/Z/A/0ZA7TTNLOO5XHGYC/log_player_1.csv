""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 if Bob refuses.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between Bob's valuation and our minimum acceptable price. By offering it at $1,300,000:

* **Bob Profits:** He still gets a $200,000 gain ($1,500,000 - $1,300,000).
* **We Profit:** We make a $300,000 profit above our minimum ($1,300,000 - $1,000,000).

This starting point leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, but ensures we maximize our potential earnings."
