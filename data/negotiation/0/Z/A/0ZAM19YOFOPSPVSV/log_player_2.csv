"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is well above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My next counteroffer is $12,500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While $12,000 is a great price,  it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to guarantee a purchase within his budget than risk not reaching an agreement with Alice in the remaining rounds."
