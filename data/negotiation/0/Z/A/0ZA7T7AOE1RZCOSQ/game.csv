"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
