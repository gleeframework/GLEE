,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend less, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $85 - that's a fair compromise, right?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, but I still think the product is worth a bit more than $85. How about we try $92? It's still a good discount from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $88. That way we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $95. I think the product is worth that much to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $92.50? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price.",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $92.50 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $90 - that's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",90.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $91? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",91.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $91 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's close this deal at $90, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you reject this offer, I'll have to buy the product from John.",90.0,Bob,10,
