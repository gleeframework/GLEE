Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
I am starting the bidding higher than Bob's perceived value, as there is no negotiation after his initial decision. While this risks him rejecting the offer, it maximizes potential profit if he accepts. If Bob rejects the offer, I will still get my minimum acceptable price from John."
