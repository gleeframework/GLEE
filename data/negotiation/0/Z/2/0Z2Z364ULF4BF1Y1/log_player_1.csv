Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. 
* **The message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While I won't get my full desired price, I'm still getting $100,000 more than Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Avoid risk:**  By offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation, I increase the chance he'll accept, guaranteeing a sale and avoiding the potential hassle of selling to John. 

**Important note:** This strategy assumes I have no other information about Bob's willingness to negotiate or his financial situation."
