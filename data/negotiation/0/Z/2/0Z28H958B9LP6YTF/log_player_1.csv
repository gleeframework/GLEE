{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, considering its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 seems a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I think I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $115.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $105. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is still a decent amount and better than selling to John for $100."
