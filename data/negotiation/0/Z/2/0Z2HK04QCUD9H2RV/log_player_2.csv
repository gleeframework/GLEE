"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and higher than Alice's valuation of $10,000. This means you can save $1,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a win-win situation, as you get a better deal and Alice still makes a profit."
