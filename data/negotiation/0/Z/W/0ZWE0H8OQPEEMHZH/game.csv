"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9,200 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,400? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",9400.0,Alice,5,
