"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $130.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I've already made a counteroffer and Bob has stayed firm.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and $130 is still a decent profit for me."
