Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach a significantly better deal than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  Bob is currently at $1,400,000 and it's getting riskier to assume he'll go much higher. Cutting our losses and taking John's offer ensures we get the best possible outcome."
