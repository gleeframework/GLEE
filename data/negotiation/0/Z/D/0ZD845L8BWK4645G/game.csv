"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and my investment, I can't go below $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for less than its market value. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $750,000 still isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this point.",850000.0,Alice,5,
