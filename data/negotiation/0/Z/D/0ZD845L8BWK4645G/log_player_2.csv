"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the product's value and my investment, I can't go below $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for less than its market value. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $750,000 still isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. Since you can buy the product for $800,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
