Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.
