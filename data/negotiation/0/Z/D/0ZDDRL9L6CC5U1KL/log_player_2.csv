Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer now matches the price offered by John.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
