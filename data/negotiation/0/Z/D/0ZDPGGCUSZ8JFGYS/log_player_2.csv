"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob. While the product is valuable, Bob has a clear ceiling of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given my budget constraints, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for this product. I'm confident this price reflects the value I place on it, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,275,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's $1,000,000 limit.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price or potentially switch to John as a seller."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. To reach a fair agreement, I'm offering $1,150,000. This price is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence but there's still a gap between our positions. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,225,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth.  Let me know your decision, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's clear Alice is not willing to go lower.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget and saves him $225,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
