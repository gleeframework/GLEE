"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given my budget constraints, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for this product. I'm confident this price reflects the value I place on it, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,275,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. To reach a fair agreement, I'm offering $1,150,000. This price is closer to my budget and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but there's still a gap between our positions. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,225,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's worth.  Let me know your decision, as I do have other interested parties.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
