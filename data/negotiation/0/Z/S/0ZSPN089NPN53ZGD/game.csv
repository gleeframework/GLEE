"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your life.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
