"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $120. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my actual budget ($80). This gives me room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This keeps the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $90. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my range, $90 is still above my budget and my alternative option (John). I'll counter-offer again, aiming to meet somewhere between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $70? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $70, showing willingness to compromise but staying below my max budget.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The message emphasizes fairness and seeks to find common ground. 
* **Time Constraint:** As rounds progress, I need to push for a deal or consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $85. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Alice stated this is her final offer, and it's still above both my budget and John's offer.
* **Time is running out:**  With more rounds passing, the potential savings from Alice are diminishing. 
* **Guaranteed deal:** John offers a sure thing at $80, which is within my budget.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
