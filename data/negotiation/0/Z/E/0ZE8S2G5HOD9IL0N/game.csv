"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business.

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which would be $1000000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1100000, which would be $1050000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to pay $990000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can agree on this price and finalize the sale.",990000.0,Bob,6,
