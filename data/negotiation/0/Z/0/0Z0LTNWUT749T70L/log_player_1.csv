"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is incrementally increasing his offers.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,375,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,350,000 is a little too low for me to accept. How about we settle right in the middle at $1,375,000?  This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,375,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting at $1,325,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away, forcing us to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
