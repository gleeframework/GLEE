"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500
* **Your Maximum:** $10,000
* **John's Offer:** $10,000

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price.  By rejecting her offer, you open the door to a potential counter-offer from Alice (hopefully lower) or you can always fall back on John's offer."
