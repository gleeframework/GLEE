"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a good middle ground between my minimum of $100 and Bob's perceived value of $150. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $125. I'm thinking more along the lines of $115. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to make this final concession to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. Can we meet at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is close to my minimum, I still want to try and get a better price.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get a slightly higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above $115. I'm thinking more along the lines of $108. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much further. I'm confident that I can get a slightly higher price with John.  He's a guaranteed sale for $100, which is more than Bob is offering. It's time to sell to John."
