"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, I'm unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can realistically work with. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000. How about we compromise at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you.  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
