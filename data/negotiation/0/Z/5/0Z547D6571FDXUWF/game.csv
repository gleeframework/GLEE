"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we try $70? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",70.0,Alice,5,
