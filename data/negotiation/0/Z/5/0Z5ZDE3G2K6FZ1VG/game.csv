"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential value of this product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $862,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",862500.0,Alice,5,
