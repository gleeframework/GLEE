"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business too. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000?  This would give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
