"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can use his knowledge of John's price as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is $200,000 lower than Alice's offer. This demonstrates Bob's intent to negotiate and potentially save a considerable amount of money. It's a bold move, but it could potentially push Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still slightly higher than Bob's ideal target. There's still some room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price.  It's a calculated risk, as Alice could ultimately decide not to negotiate further and Bob might end up having to buy from John. However, the potential savings are significant."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  $1,100,000 is a reasonable middle ground and could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price is significant.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price, saving Bob a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
