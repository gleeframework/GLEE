"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued by its users. Given its quality and features, it's worth significantly more than $100 to many people. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose a price of $120 for you to consider. This price reflects not only its current market value but also the potential long-term benefits you might derive from it.
