"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is close, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can make a deal work at that price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've been flexible with the price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiating. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,000,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
