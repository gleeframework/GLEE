"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $150 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we compromise at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $160? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob, but I'm getting closer to your price. How about we meet at $165? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $165 is still slightly out of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $162.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",162.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $162.50. How about we try $167.50? It's a small increase, but I'm hoping it's worth it to you.",167.5,Alice,7,
