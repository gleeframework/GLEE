"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $100, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $120.
