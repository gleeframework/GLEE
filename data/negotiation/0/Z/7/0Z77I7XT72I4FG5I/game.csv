"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $15,000 to you and I'm getting a fair price for my investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which still gives you a good value, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $14,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $15,750. That's a good compromise, and ensures we both get a fair deal.",15750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $15,000, so I'm thinking $15,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15200.0,Bob,6,
