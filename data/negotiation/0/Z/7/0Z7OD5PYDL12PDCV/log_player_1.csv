"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is significant. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob, aiming to encourage acceptance. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Leaving room to negotiate allows me to explore potential counteroffers. 
* **Backup plan:**  I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and the John alternative, so I'm prepared to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still significantly below my desired value.
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 8 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to explore a higher price through counteroffers.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a great opportunity for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (somewhat):**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still significantly higher than his initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while keeping a considerable margin.
* **Reframing the offer:** The message highlights the ""fair price"" and emphasizes the ""opportunity"" for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potential benefit.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  I want to keep the conversation going and see if I can bridge the gap further. 
* **Maintaining the safety net:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price I'm not satisfied with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my desired value:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,750 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000, and even my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have 6 rounds remaining to potentially secure a better price. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I'm aware that selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm not ready to give up on the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'll likely need to make a smaller counteroffer in the next round, to show my flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $10,900. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a smaller counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price. This is important to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob that my price is still fair.
* **Positive framing:**  The message uses positive language to encourage agreement.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I want to continue exploring possibilities with Bob before resorting to selling to John.
* **Staying close to my minimum:** My counteroffer is still relatively close to my minimum of $15,000, leaving room for future negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,450. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to 4 rounds left. It's getting increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  While Bob's offers are getting closer, they're still significantly below my minimum desired price, and my room for further concessions is limited.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  The likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds is decreasing.  The risk of ending up with a price below my minimum outweighs the potential benefits of further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than any price Bob has offered so far.  It's a more secure and profitable option at this stage."
