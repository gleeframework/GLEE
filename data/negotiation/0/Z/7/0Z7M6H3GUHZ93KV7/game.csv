"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to gain value from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.
