"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Consider this my best offer:  $1,000,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit by starting with a high offer. She claims it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, but you know your own valuation.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high, which might lead her to make a counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, closer to her actual valuation of $800,000."
