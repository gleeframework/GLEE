"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a little high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
