"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's plenty of room for negotiation.  I should aim lower to try and secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're not quite there yet. I'll try to negotiate a little further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is still a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down considerably, and while I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. $775,000 is a solid price, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk it falling apart."
