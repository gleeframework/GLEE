"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it gives us both a good margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. This aligns closely with its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
