"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold opening, but it allows me to maximize potential profit. I'm aiming for a good profit margin, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value, and it shows flexibility while leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer further.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable value and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a good compromise. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still believe I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range, and I'm running out of time. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a profit and prevents me from having to sell to John for a lower price."
