Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value and potential benefits for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There is a $2,000 difference between my starting price and Bob's perceived value. This provides a buffer for potential counteroffers and allows for a win-win scenario.
* **Maintaining optionality:**  I'm always aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This keeps me in a strong position and gives me leverage during the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a better price than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I have room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target while still exploring the possibility of reaching an agreement with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $13,500 to make this worthwhile. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing the scales:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reiterate the reason for my price. This can make Bob more willing to increase his offer.
* **Seeking a middle ground:**  Proposing a middle ground encourages a compromise and shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13000. That's the highest I can stretch it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiations:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has made a significant concession, and I can potentially negotiate further in the future.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a deal that's relatively close to my minimum and provides a foundation for potential future negotiations if the opportunity arises."
