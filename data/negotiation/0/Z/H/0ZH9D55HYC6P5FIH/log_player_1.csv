"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, making it clear I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Safety Net:** I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach aims to portray fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate. It shows I'm willing to move from my initial price.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  The message subtly reiterates the product's high value, reinforcing why this price is justified.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This offer keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we agree on $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Profit:** $950,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Bob's Budget:**  Bob's mention of a budget, while potentially a negotiation tactic, suggests he might be reaching his upper limit.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
