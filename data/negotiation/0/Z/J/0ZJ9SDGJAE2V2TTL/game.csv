Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14000, which is still a great value for the product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $14000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $12000.  This represents a fair compromise and a substantial reduction from your initial offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $13500.

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500, which I believe is a fair compromise and a very good value for the product.  Let's try to reach a deal before time runs out.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13000.
