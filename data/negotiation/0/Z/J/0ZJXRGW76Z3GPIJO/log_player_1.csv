"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum. I'm also framing the message in a way that emphasizes the value of the product to me, hoping to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to settle for less, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. The message emphasizes the desire to ""make this work,"" suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above that. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm determined to get at least $110 for the product. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the desire to close the deal, hoping to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $107.50. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I've still not reached my desired price. Bob is persistent, but his offers are still below my minimum.  Rather than risk losing more time with counteroffers, it's time to secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
