Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $800,000 for the product, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Negotiation:**  By offering $950,000, I aim for a price close to the middle ground. This gives Bob a significant discount from his maximum value, while still leaving me with a substantial profit.

This approach maximizes my chances of Bob accepting the offer while ensuring I don't miss out on a good deal."
