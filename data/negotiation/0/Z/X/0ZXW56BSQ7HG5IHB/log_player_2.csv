"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer and tailored specifically for individuals like you who appreciate its value. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity even more appealing to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible. Alice's first offer of $950,000 is too high. It's better to reject and counteroffer to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better align with your budget. I am willing to consider $875,000 as the price for our premium product. I believe this offer strikes a balance between value and affordability. Let's continue the conversation to explore if this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $875,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000. There is still room to negotiate. Bob should reject this offer and continue to try to get a lower price.  There are still 7 rounds left to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget. This is a serious offer, and I believe we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price for the product, Bob. In light of your latest offer, I propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value the product offers. I look forward to your response and hope we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Target:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 above Bob's ideal price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Going Higher:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will not come down further, and he might end up paying more. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a chance that Bob might not be able to secure a lower price before he needs to decide to buy from John.

**Conclusion:**  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and get the product for a price that's close to his budget."
