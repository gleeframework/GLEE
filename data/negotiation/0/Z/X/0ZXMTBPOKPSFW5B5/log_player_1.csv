Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we possibly meet at this price point?

Bob seems firm on his $10,000 offer.  It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher.  Selling to John ensures a $12,000 profit, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
