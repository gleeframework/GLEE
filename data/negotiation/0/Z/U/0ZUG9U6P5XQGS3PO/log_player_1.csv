Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a high number. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, his counteroffers might be closer to my desired range than if I started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000).  If Bob's counteroffers don't meet my expectations, I'm comfortable walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still $200,000 above his estimated value for the product. This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I can secure $1,500,000 from John. It makes sense to counter and see if I can bridge the gap with Bob before accepting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I believe the product's value is higher than that, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the product's unique features and potential for your business."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Target:** I reduced my price by $200,000 to signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I remain well above both Bob's perceived value and my guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Justification:**  I'm highlighting the product's specific benefits to Bob, subtly reminding him why it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me valuable insight into Bob's negotiation stance and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now $50,000 higher than John's guaranteed offer.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant increase. Further negotiation could also risk alienating him.
* **Securing the Deal:**  It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it by being too aggressive in the final stages."
