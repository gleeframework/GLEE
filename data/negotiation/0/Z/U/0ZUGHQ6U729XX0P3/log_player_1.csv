Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $100 from John, aiming higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $95 makes it more tempting than Bob's perceived value of $80, potentially leading him to accept. This price also leaves you with a $15 profit over your minimum. 
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:** By presenting the price as a ""special offer,"" it implies a time-sensitive deal and could encourage Bob to act quickly."
