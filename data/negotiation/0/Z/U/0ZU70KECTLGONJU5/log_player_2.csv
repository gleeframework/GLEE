"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your top limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $10,000.  While we could continue negotiating, the potential savings are getting smaller and we risk Alice becoming less flexible.  $10,250 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $4,750 compared to John's offer."
