"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your top limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,7,
