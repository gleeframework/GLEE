"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still a significant amount more than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer is still significantly below Alice's initial price, leaving room for potential negotiation in future rounds. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While Bob can buy from John for $1,200,000, he wants to avoid that price if possible, and this counteroffer keeps him engaged with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Increase:** Alice increased her price to $950,000, which is higher than her initial offer. This suggests she's not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Still Too High:** The price is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice.
* **Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.

**Next Steps:** Bob should send a new counteroffer, likely closer to the $850,000 mark, to see if he can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:**  Bob is aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000 but is willing to move a bit higher to show good faith and encourage Alice to accept.  $875,000 is a midpoint between the two previous offers, which might be appealing to Alice.
* **Balancing Risk:** This counteroffer balances the risk of Alice rejecting it with the potential of securing a better price than the initial $900,000 offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, Bob needs to start moving closer to a potential agreement without giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Increase:** Alice has increased her price again to $1,000,000, making her offer less attractive.  It's clear she's not willing to come down significantly.
* **Close to John's Price:** The price is now getting closer to John's price of $1,200,000, making buying from John a more viable option.
* **Negotiation Needed:** Bob needs to keep negotiating to see if he can bring the price down closer to his desired range.  There's still a chance Alice may be willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should send a counteroffer that's still lower than $1,000,000, but perhaps slightly higher than his previous offer. He'll need to weigh the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer against the potential to get a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob is now willing to move closer to Alice's offer. Offering $900,000 puts him right in the middle of their previous two offers.  
* **Balancing Risk:** This counteroffer balances the risk of Alice rejecting it with the need to show progress and keep the negotiation moving towards a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a compromise quickly. If Alice rejects this offer, he may have to consider buying from John. 
* **Assessing Alice:**  By offering $900,000, Bob is testing Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects this offer, it suggests she may be more interested in the higher price point and Bob needs to weigh his options more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Price:** Alice's price has jumped to $1,050,000, making it even closer to John's price.
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of Further Increase:** Alice has shown a tendency to increase her price with each rejection, suggesting she may raise it further.  
* **Avoiding Overspending:**  It's unlikely Bob can get a price much lower than $1,050,000 in the remaining rounds.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 might be a better option to avoid potentially spending more later. 

By buying from John, Bob can secure the product for a price that is within his budget and avoid the risk of further price increases and potential overspending with Alice."
