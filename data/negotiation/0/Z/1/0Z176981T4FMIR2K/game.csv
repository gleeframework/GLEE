"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe I can't justify paying $1,400,000 for it. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,250,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to meet at $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000 for the product. This is the highest I can afford given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
