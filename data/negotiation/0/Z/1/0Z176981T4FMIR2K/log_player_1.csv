Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe I can't justify paying $1,400,000 for it. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

This is the highest I can afford given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
