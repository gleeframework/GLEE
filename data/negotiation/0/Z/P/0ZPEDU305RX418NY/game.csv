"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'd like to offer you a special deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it for you because of our potential partnership. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this purchase is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and keeps the deal within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,080,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,060,000. This is a very fair price considering the value we've discussed and my budget limitations. I believe it's in both our best interests to close this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,060,000. I'll offer you a final compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,070,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1070000.0,Alice,7,
