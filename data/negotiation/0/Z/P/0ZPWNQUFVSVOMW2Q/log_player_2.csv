"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is selling for, you can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of you to find a price that works."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves her with a profit, as the product is only worth $120 to her. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate to reach a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $142 is only slightly better than her original offer of $140.  This suggests that she's not willing to negotiate much further. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $150. It's guaranteed and only slightly more than what I'm willing to pay.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of her ending the negotiation or raising her price again."
