"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting your bottom line.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
