"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer but still a little high for me. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
