"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with my offer: $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a counteroffer that is still slightly higher than his maximum budget. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal. The offer of $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to adjust my offer to $90. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to negotiate, offering a price that is still above his maximum budget of $80 but closer to Alice's last offer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise and shows he is actively trying to reach a mutually agreeable price. The offer of $87 also keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm glad we're getting closer. To continue moving forward, I propose we set the price at $89 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $89 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still not within his preferred range.  Bob has a better option with John offering the product for $80.  However, there's a chance Bob can still negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there.  $89 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $86?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a price that's closer to his preferred range. The offer of $86 is a slight compromise, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway. This is also a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to concede further. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely buy from John, as it's getting close to his maximum budget and John's offer is already at his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already had 6 rounds of back and forth with Alice.  Given John's offer of $80, it's more financially advantageous for Bob to simply buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
