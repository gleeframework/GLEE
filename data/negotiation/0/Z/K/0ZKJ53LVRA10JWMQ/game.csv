"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $92. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",92.0,Alice,5,
