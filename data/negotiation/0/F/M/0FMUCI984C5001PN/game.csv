"Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
