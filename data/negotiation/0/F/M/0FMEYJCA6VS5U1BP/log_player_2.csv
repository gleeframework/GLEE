"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $105 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $110?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $105.  While Bob could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk Alice will reject and Bob may end up paying the full $120 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $110 is a good compromise and saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John."
