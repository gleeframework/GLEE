"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $850,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, leaving room for both parties to compromise.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fantastic price considering the value you'll get. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:**  Buying from Jhon would be significantly more expensive, so it's better to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  Bob emphasizes that $900,000 is a ""fair price,"" making it sound reasonable.
* **Closing the deal:**  Bob focuses on finalizing the deal, suggesting a sense of urgency."
