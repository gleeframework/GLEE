Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fantastic price considering the value you'll get. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired range. While I'd like to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
