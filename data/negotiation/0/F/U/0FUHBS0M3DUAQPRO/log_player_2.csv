"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! I've set the price at $950,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $900,000. This still gives you a significant benefit and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's $100,000 less than buying from John and is within Bob's desired price range.  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it's also possible to risk getting stuck with John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
