"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if a lower counteroffer can be reached before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible while still securing the product. He offers a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a respectable amount above John's offer. This counteroffer establishes a starting point for further negotiation while keeping Bob in a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John for $10,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $1,000 compared to John."
