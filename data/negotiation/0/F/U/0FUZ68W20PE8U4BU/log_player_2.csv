"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my maximum, I don't know if Alice is willing to go lower. It's always worth trying to negotiate. There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's a reasonable starting point that gives us both room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a $1,000 saving for me. While I might be able to squeeze out another $1,000 or so, there's no guarantee Alice will accept further counteroffers.  Accepting this offer saves me time and ensures I get a good deal compared to John's price."
