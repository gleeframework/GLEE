"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8000. This is my maximum offer, considering the value I place on this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still out of my price range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm willing to offer $9500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
