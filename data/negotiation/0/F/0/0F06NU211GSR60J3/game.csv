"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's split the difference and get this done.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $900,000, which would be $912,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",912500.0,Alice,7,
