Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price than selling to John.  Let's see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still a good price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price by counter-offering.  Let's see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's closer to his perceived value than my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back to selling to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a bit more. Let's try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair price for Bob given his initial offer.  If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob is firm on his price, and while I'm willing to settle at $1,000,000, I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to move on and avoid further negotiation."
