"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $25000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $15000 for this product.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $20000 for the product. Can you consider that?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $18000. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,
