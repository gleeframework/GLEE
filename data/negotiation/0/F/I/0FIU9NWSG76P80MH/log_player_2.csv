"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal, as it's worth $100 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to anchor the price lower. While it's a significant jump from her offer, it leaves room for negotiation and is still a profitable price for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate further.  Getting closer to $80 would be ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. It puts the negotiation within a reasonable range for both parties."
