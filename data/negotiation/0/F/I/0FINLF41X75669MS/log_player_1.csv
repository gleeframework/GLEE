{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values the product at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000). 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could try for a price closer to $15,000, it might make Bob less likely to accept. A price of $14,000 seems both attractive to Bob and profitable for you."
