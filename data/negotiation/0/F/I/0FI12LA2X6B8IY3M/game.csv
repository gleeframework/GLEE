,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $900000. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which is as high as I'm willing to go.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not sure $850000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product, which is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $925000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not sure $925000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $800000, Bob. I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle, but I need you to be willing to pay at least $1000000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
