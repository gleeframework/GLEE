{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000 because it's slightly above the value Bob places on the product, giving me some room for negotiation.  However, it's not so high that it would immediately make him reject the offer. I'm also being positive and framing the offer as beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going with a counteroffer of $11,000. It's a compromise that's still above my minimum, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the fairness and the potential for Bob to be happy with the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That seems fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $12,000, as that guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
