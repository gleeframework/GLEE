"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, $14,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $11,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer $10,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
