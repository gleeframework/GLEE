Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that's lower than what I would receive from John, so I'm not losing money by offering it to Bob. 

I believe this is a good starting point for the negotiation, as it gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured into accepting a price that's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000. This is still above Bob's offer of $850,000 but is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While it's still below my minimum target of $1,200,000, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.  Further negotiation might take time and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  Therefore, accepting his offer seems like the most reasonable decision at this point."
