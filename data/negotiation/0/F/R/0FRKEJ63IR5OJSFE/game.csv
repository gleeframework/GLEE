"Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
