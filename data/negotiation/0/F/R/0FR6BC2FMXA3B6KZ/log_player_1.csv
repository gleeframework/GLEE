Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering it too close to $15,000 might make Bob balk.  A slightly lower price increases the chances he'll accept outright.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less than that."
