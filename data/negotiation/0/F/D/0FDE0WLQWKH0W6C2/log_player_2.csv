"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000. By rejecting the offer, you have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  While you have a guaranteed option with John, it's always better to try to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's not willing to budge, you can always adjust your counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue to try and get a lower price. You are still significantly below your maximum price point, so continuing to negotiate is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting closer! This counteroffer increases the price by $100,000, showing that you're willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's a reasonable increase, but still leaves room for Alice to come down a bit more.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both parties feel they've gotten a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, and we are getting closer to a good deal.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not come down further, and we would be stuck with John's much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
