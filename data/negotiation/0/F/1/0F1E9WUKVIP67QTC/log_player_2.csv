Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product to me is significantly higher, and I'm willing to continue negotiations. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects a compromise, allowing you to acquire the product at a price that's still advantageous to you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could become inflexible or you might lose the opportunity to buy from her.  Accepting the offer is a safe choice and gets you the product at a favorable price."
