Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $900,000 price point allows for some flexibility during the negotiation, while still being a substantial profit for me.
* **Motivating Bob:**  By offering a price that is slightly more attractive than John's offer, I hope to encourage Bob to engage in negotiations. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  There's still some space between his offer and my minimum price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting his offer, I want to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he's prepared to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $875,000? This would still allow you to profit from the product, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Compromise:**  By offering $875,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  This price point is still above my minimum acceptable amount, but it's more enticing to Bob than my previous offer.
* **Maintaining a Balance:**  I'm aiming for a price that is fair to both parties, allowing Bob to profit while ensuring I get a reasonable return."
