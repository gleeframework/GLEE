"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to establish a lower price point and leave room for negotiation. By offering $950,000, Bob shows his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum. He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Alice.  He should reject the offer and try to push for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price, which is also the price he could purchase the product from John. This is a strong move as it shows Alice that Bob is serious about closing the deal, but also that he is not willing to go higher."
