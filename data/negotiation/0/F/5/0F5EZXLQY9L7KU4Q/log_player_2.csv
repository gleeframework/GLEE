"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for a price significantly lower than its value to you, and I'll be able to earn a substantial profit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. John's offer of $1,200,000 sets your maximum price, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."
