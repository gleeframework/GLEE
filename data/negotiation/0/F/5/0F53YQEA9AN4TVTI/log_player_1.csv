Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Let's push a little further and see if we can get closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.  What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob seems anchored at $1,250,000.  While ideally, we'd like to get closer to $1,300,000, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting his offer at $1,250,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or dragging out the negotiation further."
