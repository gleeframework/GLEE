This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also highlights the value to Bob, potentially motivating him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $650,000 is better than my floor of $800,000, it's still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

$750,000 is still below my floor price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made.  To be honest, $850,000 is a bit too tight for my budget.  I can do $800,000, and that's my absolute best.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and if we can make it work, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

This is my floor price, and Bob has come up to meet it. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by trying to squeeze out more."
