"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This still gives you a significant discount on the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made.  To be honest, $850,000 is a bit too tight for my budget.  I can do $800,000, and that's my absolute best.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and if we can make it work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
