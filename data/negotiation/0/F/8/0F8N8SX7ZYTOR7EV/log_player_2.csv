"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should start by offering a much lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This still gives you a significant discount on the true value of the product.

Alice is coming down, but we're still far apart.  I'll try to nudge the price closer to my target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.

This is a tough one. Alice is putting on the pressure with a ""final offer"". However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to risk it and see if I can push her a little further."

I can do $800,000, and that's my absolute best.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and if we can make it work, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
