"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob ($150), making it tempting.  
* **The message is friendly and positive:**  This sets a good tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to $150, but I'm starting lower to see how willing Bob is to negotiate. I'll also use the threat of selling to John as a backup option if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While I'm happy he's showing interest, $120 is still below my minimum of $100.  
* **I have room to negotiate:** I'm not in a rush, and I believe I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob why he's interested.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm using positive language to keep the communication friendly and encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to inch closer to my desired price while still maintaining a reasonable position. This counteroffer also gives Bob an opportunity to meet me in the middle, potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Even though I'm willing to negotiate, $115 is still below my $100 minimum.
* **I'm not in a rush:**  I have 6 more rounds to get a better deal, and John is a guaranteed sale for $100.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $125, but I'm prepared to lower my expectations slightly to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to drop my price to $110. This is a fair offer for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows continued flexibility and a desire to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that $110 is a ""fair offer"" for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Keeping the negotiation positive:** I use positive language and reiterate my desire to make the deal work.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal at a price that's just above my minimum, but still acceptable to Bob.  This counteroffer should hopefully encourage Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to keep negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $125, Bob's offer of $105 is just above my minimum of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $100. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a deal with Bob at $105 than to risk getting nothing at all.  While I'd like to get more, accepting this offer is the most practical choice given the circumstances."
