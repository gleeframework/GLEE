Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is getting closer to my goal, I believe I can still push for a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm only two rounds away from reaching my target price of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the next two rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to buying the product, but $9,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we meet at $9,750?  This is a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $9,200? I'm really interested in buying this product and I think this is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, I'm still hopeful I can secure a price closer to my target of $10,000. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's meet at $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us. If you agree, we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really at my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. If you accept, I'll buy the product from you right now.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm very close to my target price. However, with only one round left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get Bob to budge any further. Selling to John for $8,000 is still a good deal and guarantees me a profit."
