"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This way, we can both walk away happy with a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
