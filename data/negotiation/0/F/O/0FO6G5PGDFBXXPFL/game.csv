,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I can't go below $9,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
