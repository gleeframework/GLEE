"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant about $82, but I'm willing to go up to $78. It's still within my budget, and hopefully, it's a good compromise for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $81. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",81.0,Alice,5,
