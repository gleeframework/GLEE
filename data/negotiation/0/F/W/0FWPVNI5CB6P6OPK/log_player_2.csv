"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

This seems like a good deal! Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is significantly less than John's offer."
