"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to make an offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle around $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,
