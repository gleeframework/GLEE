Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,199,999. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""worthwhile investment"" aim to increase the perceived value for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't mind potentially losing Bob as a buyer to gain an extra dollar. If you want to be absolutely sure Bob buys it, a price closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) would be wiser."
