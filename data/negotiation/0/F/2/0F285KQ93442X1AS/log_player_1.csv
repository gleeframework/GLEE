Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a price closer to that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **High but Reasonable:**  This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but the message emphasizes ""value"" and a ""competitive price"" to make it seem more appealing.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay.  If you had more information about Bob's willingness to spend, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
