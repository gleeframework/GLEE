Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 if Bob declines. 

By offering the product at $140, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive compared to not having the product. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while ensuring I get a good deal even if he refuses."
