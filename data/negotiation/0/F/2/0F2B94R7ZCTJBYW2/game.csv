"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're confident in the product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is the maximum value I place on it. Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited.  I'm happy to pay $12500 for it. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll sell it to you for $13750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,5,
