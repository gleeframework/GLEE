Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, $7,500 is still not meeting my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my target of $10,000. Let's aim for $9,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

It's clear Alice is very firm on a price above your budget and very near your fallback option. It's unlikely she'll go below $8,000, so it's better to secure the deal with John at your target price."
