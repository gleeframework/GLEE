"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's a bit less than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That leaves room for us both to be happy.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. Would you be willing to accept $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a little below what I need.  However, I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
