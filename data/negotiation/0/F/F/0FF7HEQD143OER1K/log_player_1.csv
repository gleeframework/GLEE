"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:** Using a friendly tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Value proposition:** I subtly hint at the value of the product for Bob without explicitly stating his perceived value.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get Bob thinking:** The higher price might make him consider the product's value more seriously.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The initial offer provides space for both of us to make concessions and find a mutually beneficial price.

I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the backup option of selling to John for $100. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value ($80), it's still below my floor of $100. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's room for a more agreeable price within the remaining rounds. 
* **Avoiding the ""John"" option:**  Selling to John for $100 would be a safe bet, but I'm aiming for a higher profit if possible.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to close the gap between our prices. I'll consider the following:

* **Remaining rounds:** With 8 rounds left, I have some time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a baseline for my counteroffers.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  Based on Bob's initial offer, I'll assess his potential to compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's a bit less than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That leaves room for us both to be happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $110 to $95, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I use phrases like ""leave room for us both to be happy"" to maintain a positive and cooperative tone.
* **Focusing on the benefit:**  I highlight that $95 is a good price for both of us, emphasizing the mutual benefit of closing the deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** $95 is roughly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($85). 
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $100.
* **Encouraging negotiation:** I'm hoping this counteroffer encourages Bob to come closer to my price in the following rounds.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will move the negotiation forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. Would you be willing to accept $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's getting closer, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** We have 6 rounds remaining, and there's room to close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'll try to find a compromise that both of us can agree on within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a little below what I need.  However, I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm further reducing my price from $95 to $92.50, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  $92.50 is precisely halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Focus on closing the deal:**  I emphasize the desire to ""finally close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Potential for acceptance:** Bob's willingness to negotiate, and the fact that this offer is a compromise, increases the chance of him accepting.

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between my interests and the need for a quick agreement."
