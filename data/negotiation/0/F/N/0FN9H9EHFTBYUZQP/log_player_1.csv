Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $11,500 as possible.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than $12,000 to entice him.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secured with John who will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
