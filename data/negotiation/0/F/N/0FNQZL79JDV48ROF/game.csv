"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts on this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
