"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a potential win for Bob, highlighting the product's value.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  While Bob has shown interest, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price.
* **Strategic move:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price and might make him reconsider his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not willing to accept Bob's low offer but am showing flexibility by lowering my price. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing it's a good investment.
* **Closing statement:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  While I could accept and secure a sale, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's a possibility he might increase his offer further.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $135 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can reach a price that's fair for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a reasonable compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly but remaining firm about not going below $140. 
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach a decision and making it clear that $140 is my final offer. 
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept and avoid a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

By making a small concession and presenting it as a final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting the deal. If he rejects, I have two more rounds to potentially negotiate with him before resorting to selling to John."
