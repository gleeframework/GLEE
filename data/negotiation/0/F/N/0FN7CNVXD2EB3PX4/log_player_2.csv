"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $9,500. While this is a good price, you can get it for $10,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer. Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John allows you to save $500."
