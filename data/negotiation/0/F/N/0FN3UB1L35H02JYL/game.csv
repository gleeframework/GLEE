"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1250000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
