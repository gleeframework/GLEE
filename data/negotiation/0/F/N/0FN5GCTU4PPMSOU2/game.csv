"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This feels like a fair offer considering my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $975,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $975,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $720,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything below $900,000 would be difficult for me to justify.  How about we split the difference and settle at $810,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",810000.0,Alice,5,
