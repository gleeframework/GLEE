"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This feels like a fair offer considering my budget."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $975,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $975,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $720,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 720000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything below $900,000 would be difficult for me to justify.  How about we split the difference and settle at $810,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $810,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $10,000."
