"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping to get Bob to agree quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he wants to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want to get for the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $115 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $105 is getting closer, I believe I can get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $110. This is my final offer.  If you're truly interested, let's seal the deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence! However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I am open to negotiation, I've already lowered my price significantly. I've also been through several rounds of negotiations, and Bob's offers are still below my target price. Given the time constraint, I am better off selling to John for $150 and guarantee a good profit for my product."
