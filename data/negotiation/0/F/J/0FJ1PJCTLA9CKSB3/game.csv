"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $115 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $110. This is my final offer.  If you're truly interested, let's seal the deal. ",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence! However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Bob,6,
