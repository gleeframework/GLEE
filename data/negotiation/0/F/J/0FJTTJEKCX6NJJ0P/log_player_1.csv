"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if needed.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'm confident he'll be willing to pay closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current proposal.  I believe this is a reasonable price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I don't want to sell to John at this point, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price and closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I don't want to sell to John at this point because I'm confident we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm going to counter with $935,000. This is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while also demonstrating that I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe Bob is willing to pay closer to $935,000.  I'm not ready to sell to John at this price point, and I still have time to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe Bob is close to accepting, but I'm not willing to drop below this point.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my desired price. While I would have preferred to get closer to $925,000, I'm running out of time and need to make a decision. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing out entirely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
