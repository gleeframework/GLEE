"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I know you value highly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is still more than your maximum value.
* You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum value. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
