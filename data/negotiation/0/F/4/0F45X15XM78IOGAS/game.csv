"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to bridge the gap, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while still being within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to land a little lower.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  I believe this is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm making a good profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
