"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you a fair offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential. However, I think $1,100,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you be open to considering $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to protect my interests. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $975,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value this brings to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own interests. I can offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
