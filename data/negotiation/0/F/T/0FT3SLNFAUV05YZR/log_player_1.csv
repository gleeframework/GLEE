```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see if Bob bites.  If not, I'll adjust my offer based on his response and my desire to close the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000,  $850,000 is a good price and ensures I make a profit.  It's also more than John is willing to pay, and we're already halfway through our rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
