Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $20,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the value and my budget constraints.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $14,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us very close to a deal.
