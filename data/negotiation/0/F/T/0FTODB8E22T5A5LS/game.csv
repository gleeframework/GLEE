"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $25,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $25,000 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $20,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the value and my budget constraints.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $18,000. This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'd agree once you experience its benefits.  What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $14,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us very close to a deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
