"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget, and John offers a better price.  However, rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a potential better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to quickly gauge her willingness to negotiate. This is a strong opening move, potentially causing Alice to reconsider her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. There are still rounds left, and Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but remaining firm about his price limit. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance while still keeping the price within Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  With John offering the product for $10,000, Bob has a guaranteed alternative. There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is very close to John's price, making it clear he's serious about acquiring the product but not willing to pay more than necessary. This move puts pressure on Alice to make a decision, as she's getting closer to the price of Bob's alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is tempting because it's closer to Bob's desired price and only $600 more than John's offer.  However, Bob still has a few rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting, he can potentially push for a lower price, especially since Alice is showing willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $10,300. This counteroffer is a good compromise between his last offer and Alice's last offer. With only a few rounds left, Bob is trying to find a middle ground that both parties could find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's only $500 more than John's offer. However, Bob has one final round left to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially secure a lower price from Alice or, in the worst-case scenario, buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final chance to secure a deal with Alice. By increasing his counteroffer slightly to $10,400, he's showing a willingness to compromise. This is a strategic move, as it's a very small step up from his previous offer, which was $10,300. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Put pressure on Alice:** Alice is now facing the possibility of losing the deal altogether if she rejects the offer.
* **Offer a reasonable compromise:**  $10,400 is a fair middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer.

While Bob could offer $10,500 to match Alice's offer, he's hoping that Alice will accept the $10,400 price, allowing him to save an additional $100."
