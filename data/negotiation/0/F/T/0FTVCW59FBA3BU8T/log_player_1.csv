Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Going too high (e.g., $119) might make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage, potentially making him walk away. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, $100 is a significant profit compared to selling to John for $80."
