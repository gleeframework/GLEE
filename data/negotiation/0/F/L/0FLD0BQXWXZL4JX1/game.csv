"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you've stated it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
