{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives me some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit over my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and ensures I get a profit over my minimum.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or even selling to John for less."
