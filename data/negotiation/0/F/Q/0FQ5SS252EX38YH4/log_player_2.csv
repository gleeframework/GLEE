"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price above my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay well below my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is the lowest I can go. This is a great product and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to my maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as I won't get a better deal."
