Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to greater profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. He might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A higher initial offer can make Bob perceive the product as more valuable, increasing the chances of him accepting a price closer to your goal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob rejects the offer outright, you'll miss the opportunity to make more than your guaranteed $15,000."
