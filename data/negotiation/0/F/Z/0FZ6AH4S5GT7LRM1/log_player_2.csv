"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and John is willing to sell the product at that price, there's no incentive to negotiate with Alice. It's a guaranteed deal with John, avoiding any risk of a protracted negotiation."
