"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my target. ",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,400. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this conversation with you.  I see that we're both willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,300.  This is a fair price that allows me to meet your needs while staying within my expectations. What do you think?",9300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,150? I think this is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs.",9150.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I want to make sure we can reach a deal. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're not comfortable with this offer, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. How about $9,175? I think this is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs.",9175.0,Bob,10,
