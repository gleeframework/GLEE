Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially allowing you to still secure a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, going too close to $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could discourage him from negotiating."
