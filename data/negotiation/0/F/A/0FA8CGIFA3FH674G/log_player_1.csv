"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it's important to establish a strong starting point. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to negotiate seriously and potentially reveal more about his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a value above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob has offered $9,000, which is closer to my desired price point.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing with each round.  It's better to secure this sale for a solid profit than risk ending up with only $8,000 from John."
