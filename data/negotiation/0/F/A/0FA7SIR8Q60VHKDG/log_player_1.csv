Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I'm not going any higher than that. Is there any room for negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I understand he's firm on $1,200,000, I still believe the product has more value than that. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure if the product is worth $1300000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1250000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer in the next round.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll take the $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession from my initial price.  If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is a fair deal.  Let me know if you'll accept it."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1275000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'm not going any higher. Can you consider this as my final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and while $1,250,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale and is close enough to my minimum price to make it a better option than continuing to negotiate."
