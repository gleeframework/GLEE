Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've set your minimum at $12,000, and this offer is $2,000 higher.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate. This increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You haven't priced it at the maximum you'd accept, so you can potentially make concessions if necessary. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a little more than his initial counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to secure a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come back to his original counteroffer of $13,000. This is a fair price, especially since I'm already at my minimum. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
