"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I can come down to $11,500. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $11,500 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we both see the value in this product. Let's meet in the middle - $10,500, and we have a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still beyond my limit. Let's split the difference and settle on $9,000.  This way, we both get a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
