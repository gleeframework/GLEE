"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that is fair to both of us.  I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is full of fluffy language about fairness and value, but the actual offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000.  There's a good chance you could get a better price by negotiating further. While buying from John for $15,000 is the absolute worst-case scenario, it's worth seeing if Alice will come down before resorting to that."
