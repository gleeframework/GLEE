"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($800,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we establish the product's value in Bob's mind and create the potential for him to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" as the negotiation progresses.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes collaboration and finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to actively participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  While I see the value in this product, my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is his maximum valuation, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side.  We have a significantly higher floor with John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer would be a substantial loss.  We'll reject and counter, aiming to guide the negotiation closer to our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, however, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential ROI for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We make a substantial decrease from our initial price to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price remains significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above John's offer.
* **Value Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value and tailor it to potentially resonate with Bob's needs, justifying the higher price point.
* **Pressure Point:**  By staying firm above John's offer, we subtly signal that we have other options without explicitly mentioning John. This might encourage Bob to be more realistic with his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  We need to assess if Bob is likely to move closer to our target in the remaining rounds, or if accepting John's offer is the more strategic choice.  We'll reject and counteroffer again, but with smaller adjustments to gauge Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm sensing we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value this product brings to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We make a smaller concession ($200,000) this round, signaling that we're approaching our limit while still incentivizing Bob to move further. 
* **Focus on Agreement:**  We shift the tone to emphasize finding common ground and the positive aspects of reaching a deal.
* **Value Justification (Again):**  We reiterate the value proposition but tie it directly to benefits for *Bob's* specific business, increasing its perceived worth.
* **Strategic Timing:**  With rounds decreasing, this counteroffer keeps us above John's offer while encouraging a more decisive response from Bob. We need to gauge if he's truly willing to negotiate towards our range or if accepting John's offer will be necessary soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above our guaranteed alternative of $1,500,000 from John. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer beyond this point, especially as he's already exceeding his initial budget.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Prolonging the negotiation further could lead to frustration or Bob reducing his offer. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
