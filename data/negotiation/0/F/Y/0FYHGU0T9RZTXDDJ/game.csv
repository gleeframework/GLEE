"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  While I see the value in this product, my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, however, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential ROI for your specific needs.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm sensing we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value this product brings to your business.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
