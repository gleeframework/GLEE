Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $175 is a good starting point, as it allows for potential concessions without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer or even sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it signals a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Potential for higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth more than that. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $125 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and above my minimum price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I'm still unable to meet at $125. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Further negotiation could lead to even lower offers, potentially resulting in a sale below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a profit. 

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob if possible, the risk of further price reductions outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
