Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing your profit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") can encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Why not other options:**

* **Offering at $120 or higher:** Bob is very unlikely to accept, as it exceeds his perceived value.
* **Offering at or slightly above $100:** This leaves potential profit on the table. You have leverage since you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
