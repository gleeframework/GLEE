Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is a bit pricey for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $140 is better than risking Bob walking away and having to settle for $150 from John.  It's a reasonable compromise."
