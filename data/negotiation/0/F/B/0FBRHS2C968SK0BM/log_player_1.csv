Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($20) while also leaving some room for negotiation with Bob.  I believe $100 is a reasonable starting point given that the product is worth $120 to him and $80 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's closer to my initial asking price of $100. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential risk of further negotiation."
