Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly anchored at $8,500. While I could push further, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $8,500 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by going to another round."
