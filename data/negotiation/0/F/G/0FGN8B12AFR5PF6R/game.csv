"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me, but I'm very interested in the product.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this work. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I understand this product represents significant value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
