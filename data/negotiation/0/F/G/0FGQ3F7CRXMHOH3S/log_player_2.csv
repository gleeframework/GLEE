"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. I have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to her value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the price significantly closer to Alice's estimated value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. It's too early to settle at $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $11,750?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It splits the difference between the previous two offers, demonstrating a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - $12,100 and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is getting closer to her likely bottom line. Accepting this offer secures a good price for me ($12,100) and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling or Alice becoming less flexible."
