Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting at $1,800,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it leaves space for negotiation. You can gradually lower the price, ultimately not going below your $1,000,000 safety net.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and Bob isn't urgently seeking an immediate purchase. If speed is key, you might offer a slightly lower price, but still above the $1,000,000 mark."
