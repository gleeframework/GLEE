Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer. I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay a significant amount for it. My initial offer was $1,200,000, and Bob's counteroffer is $1,100,000, which is still a decent price. However, I'm not sure if I want to sell it to him at that price, as I could potentially get a better deal.

After considering my options, I've decided to...

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. Maybe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000."
