Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It also gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to sell quickly,  $15,000 is my absolute minimum, and I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.  Hopefully, this shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly from his last offer, and it's now above my minimum threshold. While I would love to get more,  it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
