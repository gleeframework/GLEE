"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,500,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
