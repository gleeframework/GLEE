"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? I'm really interested in the item, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair compromise, and it lets me buy the product without breaking the bank.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. $100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $90.  That's a really fair price for both of us. It would allow me to buy the product, and I'm sure you'd still make a good profit.",90.0,Bob,6,
