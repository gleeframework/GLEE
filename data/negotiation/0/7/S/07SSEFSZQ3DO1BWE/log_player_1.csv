Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its quality and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider the price (quality and potential) which might make him more likely to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message explicitly shows I'm open to discussion.

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Counter-offer:**  I can propose a price closer to my initial offer,  perhaps $15,000, to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Test Bob's interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious he is about buying the product and how willing he is to negotiate.

**Next steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'll propose a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Be firm:** I'll stick to my minimum price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value and quality to justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to keep negotiating.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's next move.  If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter-offer again or sell to John.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:**  I'm ready to continue negotiating if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000. Can you consider $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $1,500 above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will walk away entirely. There's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the next round.
* **Time value of money:**  It's advantageous to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation time. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $13,500 ensures a quick sale and a price that's only slightly below my ideal asking price.  It's a good compromise considering the risk of further negotiation."
