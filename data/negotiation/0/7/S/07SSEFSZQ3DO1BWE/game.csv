"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $15000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000. Can you consider $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
