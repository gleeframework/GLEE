(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,500. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price.  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum price of $10,000. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay. There's a good chance that Alice is willing to go lower, especially since her offer is higher than your last counteroffer.  You can likely get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing flexibility, but still lower than Alice's current offer. It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're sticking to your price limit. This approach increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still higher than you're comfortable with.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not lead to a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity to purchase from John. Buying from John ensures you get the product for a price within your budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest."
