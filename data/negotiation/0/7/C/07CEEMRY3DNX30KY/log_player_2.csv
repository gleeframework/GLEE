Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $87.50?  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $91.00. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's a good deal for you, saving you $29 compared to buying from John.  Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, it's likely that rejecting it will lead to more back and forth that may not get you a better price."
