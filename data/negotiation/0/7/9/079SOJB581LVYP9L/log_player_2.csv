"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. $6,000 is a good price, but there's a chance you can get it even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore the possibility of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 17% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to negotiate further. While $5,000 is a considerable drop, it's still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still lower than her starting price.  This suggests she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $5,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to my ideal price point.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but she is showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to reject her offer and make a counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my desired price point.  There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $6,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal. At this price, I'm still saving a substantial amount compared to John's offer.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this counteroffer, as it seems like a fair compromise considering the progress we've made in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now getting closer to John's price.  While there's still some room for negotiation, the risk of going another round and potentially ending up with a higher price than John's is too high.  At this point, it's more prudent to secure the product from John at a known price, ensuring I stay within my budget."
