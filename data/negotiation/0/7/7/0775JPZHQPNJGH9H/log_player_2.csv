"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $2,000 by going with John, making it the most financially sound decision."
