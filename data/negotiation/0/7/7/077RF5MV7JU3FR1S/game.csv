"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. I'm confident that this price is fair and will benefit both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
