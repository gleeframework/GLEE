"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $800000. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price, taking into account the market value and the benefits you'll receive from owning this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is closer to my budget, I'm still limited to $800000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and the potential returns. If you're willing to consider my offer, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and potential returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm trying to be reasonable.  While $950000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. My final offer remains $800000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
