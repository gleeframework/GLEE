"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $11,500. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and get the best deal possible. While Alice's new offer is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. He wants to see if he can get even closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,250? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob ideally wants to pay less, Alice's offer of $11,250 is very close to his target of $10,750 and also a good deal compared to John's price of $12,000.  It's reasonable for Bob to accept this offer and close the deal.  It's unlikely he'll get a significantly better price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
