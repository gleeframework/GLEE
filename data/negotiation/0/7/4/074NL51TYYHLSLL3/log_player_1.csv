Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $14,000.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price point. I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
