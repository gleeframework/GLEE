Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key here is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but still allows you to make a profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you don't need to go below your minimum price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Profitable:** You make a $1,450,000 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him, which is a significant saving.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, there might be a small window for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn even more. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you should immediately sell the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
