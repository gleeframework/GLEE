"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's my absolute limit.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
