Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Can you consider my counteroffer?

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm not going any lower.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a good deal here, but we're still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiations, I've had enough rounds and I'm not sure he'll come closer to my value. John is a safe bet and offers a guaranteed profit."
