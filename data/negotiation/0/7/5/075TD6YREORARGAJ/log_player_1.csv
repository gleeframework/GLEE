I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to entice Bob to engage in the negotiation, while still giving me a decent profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still being a fair price for the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'll sell to John for $10,000 to secure the sale and avoid the possibility of a further price reduction."
