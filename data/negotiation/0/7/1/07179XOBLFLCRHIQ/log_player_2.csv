"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,200,001. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  Since you're only willing to pay up to $1,200,000, a counteroffer would be a good strategy to try and save even a small amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,001 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $1,199,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1199000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,199,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is now exactly your maximum limit.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again, and then you'd be forced to buy from John for the same price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product without taking any more risks."
