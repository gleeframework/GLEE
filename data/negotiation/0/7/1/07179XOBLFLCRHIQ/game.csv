"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,001 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $1,199,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1199000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,199,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
