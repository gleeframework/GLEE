"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000. A counteroffer of $10,000 provides a good starting point for further negotiation. It leaves room for both parties to compromise while still achieving a positive outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is still lower than what John is offering ($15,000) and is a good compromise compared to Bob's last counteroffer of $10,000.  It's worth accepting to save $2,000.  There's a chance Bob could get an even lower price by continuing to negotiate, but there's also a risk that Alice might walk away, and Bob would then be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
