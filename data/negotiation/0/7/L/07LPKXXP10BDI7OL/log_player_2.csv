"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its quality and the value it brings, I would like to propose a fair price of $140 for you to purchase it. This offer reflects its true worth while allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above your maximum budget of $150 and more expensive than buying from John. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to purchase from John at your set limit."
