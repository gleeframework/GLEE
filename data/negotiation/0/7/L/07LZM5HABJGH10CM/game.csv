"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $1,050,000.  The product is worth significantly more to me, and I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair price that still offers you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product to you, I am still aiming to keep my investment below $1,000,000. Could we perhaps agree on $1,075,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
