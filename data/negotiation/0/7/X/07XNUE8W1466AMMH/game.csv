"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However,  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can meet you at $12,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,100. This is my absolute limit, and I think it's a very fair price for both of us.",12100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but no lower. This is the best I can do.",12500.0,Alice,7,
