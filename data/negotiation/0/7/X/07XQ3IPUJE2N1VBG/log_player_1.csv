Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know you're interested in.  Given its value, I believe a price of $10,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring you get a price significantly above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
