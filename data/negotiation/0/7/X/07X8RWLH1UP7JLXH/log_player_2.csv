"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product for a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to spend a maximum of $10,000. Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is above your budget.  While it's a ""unique opportunity"",  it's not worth paying more than you're comfortable with.  You can get the same product from John for your maximum price."
