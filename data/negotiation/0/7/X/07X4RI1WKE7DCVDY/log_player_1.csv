Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to try and get a better price than $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for.

Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to my desired range. I've already gone through a few rounds and don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $16,500."
