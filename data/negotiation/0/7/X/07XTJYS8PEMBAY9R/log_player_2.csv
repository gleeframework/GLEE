"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's always a good idea to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high, giving you room to negotiate.  You can then try to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13500, which is a great compromise. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can still try to negotiate further, aiming to get closer to your $10,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $12200, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,200 is still above your comfort zone.  At this point, you've tried to negotiate and it seems unlikely that Alice will go any lower. It's more beneficial to purchase the product from John for $10,000, saving you $2,200."
