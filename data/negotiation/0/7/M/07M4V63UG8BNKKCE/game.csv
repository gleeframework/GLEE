"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. I can go up to $700,000 if that works for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to sell for $1,000,000.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this deal work with you, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. I'm hoping you can agree to this offer.",900000.0,Alice,7,
