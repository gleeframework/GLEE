{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I can afford to make concessions. 
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""very valuable"" helps frame the offer in a positive light.

This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still giving me a good chance of getting a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I need to earn.
* **There's still potential for negotiation:**  I can still try to get a better price from Bob. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that attempts to bridge the gap between our desired prices while still protecting my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,800. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce the worth of my offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Ending with ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Bob a chance to accept a more favorable price than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,200, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,900. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum but still below:**  Bob's offer of $8,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks going back and forth without reaching a price I'm happy with. There's also no guarantee he'll accept any further counteroffers.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further negotiation risks.

Given the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum and the potential for prolonged negotiations, selling to John is the most financially secure option. It ensures a quick sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
