I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before deciding whether to go lower or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still too low for me. I'm not willing to drop down to that price yet. I'll make a counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge much further.  It's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a better price from him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
