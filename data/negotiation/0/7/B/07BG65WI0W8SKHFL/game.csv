,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of your product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1375000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $1375000 is closer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1625000. This price is closer to your offer and still ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1625000 is still a bit above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
