"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation.
* You want to try and get a lower price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay a premium for the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I want to see if I can push for a lower price closer to $850,000.
* Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's a good chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up on the deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and her offer of $885,000 is only $35,000 more than my last counteroffer.
*  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
*  At this price, I'm still saving $115,000 compared to buying from John. 
*  It's a good deal for both of us, allowing Alice to make a profit while securing me the product at a reasonable price."
