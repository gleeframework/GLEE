Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start with a strong and confident message, emphasizing exclusivity and value.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is below your guarantee from John but significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing""  suggests there might be some flexibility, giving Bob an incentive to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give more room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might adjust your price accordingly."
