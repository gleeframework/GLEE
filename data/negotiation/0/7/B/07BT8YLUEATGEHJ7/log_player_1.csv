Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
