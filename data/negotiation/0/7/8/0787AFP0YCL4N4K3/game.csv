"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider $1,300,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
