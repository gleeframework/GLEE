Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 leaves room for him to counteroffer while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $100 provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers fall too low, you can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is more than your minimum, Bob's offer is significantly below his perceived value of the product ($120). There's still room for negotiation. You'll reject his offer to signal that you value the product higher and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Countering with $110 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Middle Ground:**  This offer positions itself as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing for Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** $110 still provides a good profit margin over your minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $108? That's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gain vs. Risk:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal at this point. Accepting $108 ensures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob's message suggests he's nearing his budget limit.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. 
* **Good Enough:** $108 is still a profitable outcome exceeding your minimum acceptable price. Sometimes, a good deal now is better than the possibility of a slightly better deal later."
