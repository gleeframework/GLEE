"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,107.5,Bob,4,
