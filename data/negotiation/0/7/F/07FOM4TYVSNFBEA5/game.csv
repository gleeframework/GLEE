"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $18000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $19000. It's a good price for a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17500 for it. Can you consider that?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. You're not willing to go up much and I'm not willing to go down much further.  I'm going to counter with $18500 and if you're not willing to go up to that price, I'll move on to another buyer.",18500.0,Alice,5,
