"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $8,500?  This is still a good deal for you, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000.
