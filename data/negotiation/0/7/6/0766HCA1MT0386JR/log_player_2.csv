"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her original price and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product at a good price, saving money compared to buying from John."
