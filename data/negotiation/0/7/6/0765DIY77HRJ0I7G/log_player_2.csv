"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $20,000 is closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $10,000 and will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm still not able to go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? It's a significant discount from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high for my budget, and I've already made a couple of counteroffers.  At this point, I'm running out of time and the risk of not getting the product is too high.  I'll go with John's offer of $10,000.  It's my maximum budget, but it ensures I get the product."
