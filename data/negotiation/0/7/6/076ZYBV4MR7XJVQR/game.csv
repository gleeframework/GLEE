"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more strategic investment. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a strategic investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $815,000. This is still a good price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",815000.0,Alice,5,
