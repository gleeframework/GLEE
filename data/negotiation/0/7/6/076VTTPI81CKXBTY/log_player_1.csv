Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $150 allows for a potential $30 profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer at $120, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
