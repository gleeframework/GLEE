"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  However, since you have the option to buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's better to reject her offer and maintain the option to buy from John if you decide you want the product."
