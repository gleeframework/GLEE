"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That's a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This offer represents a considerable discount already, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $725,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer, $725,000 is still considerably less than my minimum price and John's standing offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to nudge him closer to the $800,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $725,000 is still significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000.  I think this price reflects the value of the product while recognizing your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can appreciate the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle this right now at $775,000? That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could hold out for $800,000 from John, Bob's offer of $775,000 is quite strong. It's a significant amount over my minimum, and there's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away. Taking this offer now is a good balance of profit and minimizing risk."
