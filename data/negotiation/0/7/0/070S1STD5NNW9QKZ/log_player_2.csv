"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That's a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low, Counter High:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives more room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer is well below both Alice's asking price and my maximum budget, but still potentially profitable for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm prepared to increase my offer in subsequent rounds, but I want to see how Alice responds first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This offer represents a considerable discount already, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** While Alice lowered her price, the decrease is not substantial enough. It suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Target Price in Mind:** My goal is to get as close to $800,000 as possible, and I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** The option to buy from John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $725,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** My counter-offer shows willingness to compromise by increasing my previous offer significantly. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market value"" introduces a slight element of doubt about the product's absolute worth to Alice, potentially encouraging her to be more flexible.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still below Alice's last offer but considerably closer, putting pressure on her to make a more significant move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $725,000 is still significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000.  I think this price reflects the value of the product while recognizing your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is getting closer to her value for the product, which suggests we're in the final stages of negotiation.
* **Room for Maneuvering:** There's still a $25,000 gap between her offer and John's price, providing some room for a final push.
* **Risk vs Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a risk that Alice might not budge much lower. However, securing a price closer to $800,000 is a worthwhile gamble at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I can appreciate the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle this right now at $775,000? That's a firm offer."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($825,000) and my previous counter ($725,000), signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **""Firm Offer"" Tactic:**  Using the phrase ""firm offer"" suggests this is my final price, potentially adding pressure for Alice to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, stating a firm offer can expedite the negotiation process. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** Even if Alice rejects this and I have to go up slightly in the next round, I'm still within a reasonable range of my target price and well below John's offer."
