"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and am open to discussing it further.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be very valuable for my business, but only at a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that for me. I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's on the table.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, that price is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering the potential value it holds for my business. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a price that aligns with your budget, and I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
