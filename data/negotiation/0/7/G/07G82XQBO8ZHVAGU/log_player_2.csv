# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and am open to discussing it further.  What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:

I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's on the table.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a price that aligns with your budget, and I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still acknowledging the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her absolute lowest offer of $1,500,000. This is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to choose that option and save the extra $300,000."
