Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I think that would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
