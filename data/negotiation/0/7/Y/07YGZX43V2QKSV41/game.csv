"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1050000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me at $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I can offer you a slight premium of $100000, which would bring the price to $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,5,,
