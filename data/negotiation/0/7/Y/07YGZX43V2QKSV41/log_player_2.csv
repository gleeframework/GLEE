"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  There's no guarantee John will be willing to sell the product for $1,000,000 in the future, so it's worth exploring the negotiation with Alice further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1050000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your target.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. While John is a backup option, it's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more savings by continuing to counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me at $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I can offer you a slight premium of $100000, which would bring the price to $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,100,000, which is still above your target. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  It's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower, and you're running the risk of the negotiation going on indefinitely.  It's safer to buy from John at $1,000,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
