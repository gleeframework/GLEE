Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $11,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go lower.  Waiting any longer risks souring the deal, and John's offer is considerably worse. Accepting at $11,250 ensures you get the product at a price significantly below your maximum."
