Round 2

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I do like it, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $60."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for this great product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $100? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a little closer to my budget. Would you consider $80? That's the absolute highest I can go."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $100, which would be $90. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to budge below $90.  While you might be able to haggle her down a little further, it's unlikely you'll get a price significantly better than John's offer of $80. You've already spent considerable time negotiating, and John's offer is guaranteed."
