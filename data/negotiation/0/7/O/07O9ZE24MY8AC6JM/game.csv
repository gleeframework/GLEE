"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I do like it, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $75? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $100? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a little closer to my budget. Would you consider $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $100, which would be $90. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you.",90.0,Alice,7,
