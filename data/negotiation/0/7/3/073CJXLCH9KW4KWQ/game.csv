"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think it's a fair compromise.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.25. I think that's a fair compromise.",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $106.25, which would be $107. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",107.0,Alice,5,
