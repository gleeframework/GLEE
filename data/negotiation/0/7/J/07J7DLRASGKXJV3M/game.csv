"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
