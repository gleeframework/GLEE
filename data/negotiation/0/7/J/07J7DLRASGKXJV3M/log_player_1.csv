{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, while also being lower than the product's worth to Bob ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
