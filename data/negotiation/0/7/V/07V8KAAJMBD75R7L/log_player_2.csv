Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you have an alternative option at $1,200,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's clear she's not going to reach $1,200,000.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a relatively small difference.  Buying from John ensures the best possible price."
