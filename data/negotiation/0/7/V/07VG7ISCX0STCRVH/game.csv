"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise given our starting points. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it ensures we both get what we want. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
