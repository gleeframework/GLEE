Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
