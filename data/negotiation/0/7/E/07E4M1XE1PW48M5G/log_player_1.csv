prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you hold a strong position. There's no need to lowball Bob. Instead, aim high to see if you can exceed your minimum. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm asking for $13,500.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Ambitious Price:** By starting at $13,500, you're aiming higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone encourages a response and potential negotiation.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get more than your minimum and Bob gets the product, though at a price higher than he'd ideally like.
* **Bob Counters:** You can negotiate down, potentially settling somewhere above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem! You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $12,000."
