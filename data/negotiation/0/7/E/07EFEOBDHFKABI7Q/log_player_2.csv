# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and the product's value doesn't change, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
