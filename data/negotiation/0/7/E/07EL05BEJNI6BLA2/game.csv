"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
