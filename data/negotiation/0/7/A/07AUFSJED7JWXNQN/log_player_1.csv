Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the value of the product and positions the price confidently, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Important Note:** This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer and you'll have to settle for your backup price. However, aiming high increases the potential for a much larger profit."
