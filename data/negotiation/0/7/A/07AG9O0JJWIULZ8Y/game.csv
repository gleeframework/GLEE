"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $10,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,500 is a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $7,000. This is a fair offer considering I can buy it from another seller for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,7,
