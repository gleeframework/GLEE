I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or simply sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway.  Since my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's not the ideal price I was hoping for, but it's still a profitable sale."
