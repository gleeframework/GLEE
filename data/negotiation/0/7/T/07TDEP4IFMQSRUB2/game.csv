"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. My asking price is $900,000.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential it holds. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure a fair return on this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential it holds for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair return, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,
