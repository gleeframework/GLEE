"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I can do $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,5,
