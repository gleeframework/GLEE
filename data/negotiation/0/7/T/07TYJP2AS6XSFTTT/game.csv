"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1400000 is slightly out of my range. I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to consider.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1375000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I think we're really close to a deal now. I'm willing to meet you at $1365000, but I'm also willing to accept $1362500. However, I'd like to propose a compromise that gets us closer to the higher end of the range. I'm now offering the product to you for $1360000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1360000.0,Alice,9,
