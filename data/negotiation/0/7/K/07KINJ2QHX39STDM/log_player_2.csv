"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying well within my $150 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my range, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer a bit below her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $97.50?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
