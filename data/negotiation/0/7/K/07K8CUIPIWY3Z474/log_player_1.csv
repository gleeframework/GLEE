Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **Lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you don't lose money if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can always adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than his own perceived value. It's not worth accepting. By rejecting his offer, you can attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than his previous offer and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price."
