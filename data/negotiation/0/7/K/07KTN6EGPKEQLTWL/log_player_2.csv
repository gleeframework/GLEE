Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $72.50. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $74? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $74. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only $6 above your ideal price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking it further might mean losing the deal and having to pay John's full price."
