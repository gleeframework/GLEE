"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $77? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",77.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $70?  That's a reasonable compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $75? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",75.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Would you consider $72.50?",72.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $72.50. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $74? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",74.0,Alice,7,
