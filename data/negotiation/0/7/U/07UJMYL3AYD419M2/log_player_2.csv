"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering and negotiating.  It's also too early in the negotiation to buy from John, as you have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong opening move that demonstrates your commitment to getting a good deal. 

It's important to remember that Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000, so this counteroffer is below that.  However, you have 9 rounds to negotiate, and Alice may be willing to compromise to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal range and you still have several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice and shows you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. It also acknowledges that Alice's offer was a step closer to your target price, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  This shows a commitment to finding a middle ground, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still too high.  You're already nearing the midpoint of the negotiation, and there's no reason to rush into a deal that's still above your ideal price.  Rejecting this offer demonstrates that you're still willing to walk away if you don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from your previous offer, showing that you're actively trying to meet Alice halfway. It's also still below your target price, but leaves room for Alice to potentially come up slightly.  

This is likely the final counteroffer before you have to seriously consider buying from John, but you're still showing you're committed to getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $812,500 is still above your ideal price, it's getting very close to your maximum budget. You've already reached round 7 of 10, and there's a risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer or even increasing her price. You also run the risk of losing the deal completely and being forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price.

Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while still saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise that secures the deal and avoids potential future risks."
