"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price, especially in the first round.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to come down in price, and you have 9 more rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I've included a brief reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing your budget constraints while acknowledging the product's value. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends by suggesting a willingness to negotiate further, encouraging Alice to respond positively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:** While Alice has shown some flexibility, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. You have 7 more rounds to explore further compromises. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice than buying from John at this point. You may be able to get a better deal than $1,500,000 if you keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  It's a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is at your maximum budget but presents it as a fair middle ground. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  It acknowledges the value of the product to keep Alice engaged.
* **Finality:**  The message implies that this is your final offer, encouraging Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1500000, which would be $1550000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to your maximum budget.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** However, you only have 5 rounds left. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, but there's also a chance she won't. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  You are now in a position where you can secure the product for a price that is only slightly higher than your maximum budget. Buying from John now eliminates the risk of further negotiation failing and potentially losing out on the product entirely. 

Since you're nearing the end of the negotiation and you're close to your budget, it's a wise choice to minimize risk and secure the product from John."
