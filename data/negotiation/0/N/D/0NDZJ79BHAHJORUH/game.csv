"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000?  It's a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product, and it's within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1500000, which would be $1550000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
