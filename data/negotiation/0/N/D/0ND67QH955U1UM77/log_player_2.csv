You're still above your ideal price point. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price of $10,000 by counteroffering again."

Alice is being stubborn and refusing to budge much further.  While $11,000 is better than John's price, it's still above your target and you're unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.  It's better to just buy from John and get this process over with."
