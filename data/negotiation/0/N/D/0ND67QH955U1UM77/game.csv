"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price that should be comfortable for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,,
