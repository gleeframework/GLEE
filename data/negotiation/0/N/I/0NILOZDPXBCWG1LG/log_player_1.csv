"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation. If he rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not ready to settle yet and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to lower my price again, showing flexibility.  I'm still above my minimum price, and hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to offer $120. I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. We're nearing the end of our rounds, so I'll need to consider whether selling to John for $150 is a better option if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely Bob won't go any higher. With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my desired price."
