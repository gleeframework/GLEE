"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings to you will more than justify the price.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
