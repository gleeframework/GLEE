"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $180 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a very low offer might encourage Alice to come down significantly from her initial price. While it's unlikely she'll accept $60 right away, this establishes a low anchor point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my $80 limit.  Alice seems firm, but I'll try to negotiate a bit more before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but $120 is still outside of my price range. Could you do $75? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Staying firm:** I'm reiterating my budget limitations to emphasize that I'm serious about not exceeding $80.
* **Incremental increase:**  By offering $75, I'm showing movement from my initial low offer while still staying below my max limit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges if Alice is truly firm at $120 or if there's room for a compromise closer to my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $110. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $110 is still significantly above my $80 limit.  
* **Final offer:** Alice stating this is her final price increases the pressure, but I'm not going to exceed my budget.  
* **One last try:** I'll make a final counteroffer that's firmly at my limit, hoping Alice might be willing to take a smaller profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but to be totally honest, $80 is the absolute maximum I can spend. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I'm hoping we can make this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, matching my maximum budget. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, but it's worth a shot before resorting to John.
* **Transparency:** Being upfront about my budget limit could encourage Alice to accept, knowing this is the best she'll get from me. 
* **Respectful but firm:** I'm acknowledging Alice's position while clearly stating my limits, leaving the decision in her hands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I understand that $80 is your absolute limit. However, I still need to make a profit, and $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $80 and my minimum price of $150, which is $125. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** It's clear now that Alice will not go below $125. She's revealed her minimum price, and her final offer reflects that. 
* **Wasting time:** Further negotiation is unlikely to change the outcome. Alice has set her boundaries, and I've set mine.
* **John's offer is better:**  It's time to cut my losses. John offers the product for $80, which is my maximum budget and a much better deal than Alice's $125."
