"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly impact your business. I'm confident it will be worth more than $10000 to you. Let's discuss how we can make this work. Considering its value, I propose a starting price of $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $25000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. Given my maximum is $12000, I'd like to offer $10000 as a starting point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $15000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget considerations. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go to $11000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for considering my proposal, Bob. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I am willing to accept $12000 for the product. This price is still above your initial offer, but it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
