Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm looking to get at least $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  My starting price is $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I have 9 more rounds to potentially get a better price.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price range before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  How about $17,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $16,500 is my final offer. This price still leaves me with a good profit margin.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he'll either walk away or refuse to negotiate further, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I make a good profit and avoids the risk of a less favorable outcome."
