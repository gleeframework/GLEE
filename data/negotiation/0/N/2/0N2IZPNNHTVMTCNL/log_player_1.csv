"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I value the product at ($15,000).  This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and we can then go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I believe I can squeeze out a bit more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is still a good deal for Bob since it's below what he values the product at.  However, it's also closer to my minimum, and hopefully will lead to a quick agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is tempting, I'm going to hold out.  I've already made a counteroffer, and accepting now might make me seem too eager.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about closing this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This is my final offer. I'm coming down to a price that's still profitable for me, but it's also getting close to my minimum. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. John offers a guaranteed profit, and I'm happy to sell the product to him."
