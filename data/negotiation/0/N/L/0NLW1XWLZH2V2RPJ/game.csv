"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's still a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
