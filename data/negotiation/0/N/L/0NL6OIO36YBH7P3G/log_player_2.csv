"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation of the product, but it's still within your budget. However, there's room for negotiation to save even more money.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1.35 million. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire for a good deal.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,275,000, which is still a good deal for me.  It's well below my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also below John's price.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
