Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's enthusiasm. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is significantly closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than your minimum ($1,000,000). This maximizes potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception and encourage a favorable response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1.35 million. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than his perceived value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit but leaves a potential $200,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire for a good deal.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's offer and desire for a good deal helps maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,200,000) and your previous asking price ($1,350,000) shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price point."
