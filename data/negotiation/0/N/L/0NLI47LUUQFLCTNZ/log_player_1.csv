Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases your chances of a successful deal.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Considering its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You position the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 price leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, a strong incentive to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and discourages Bob from countering with a much lower offer. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly downward if Bob pushes back, but don't go below your $1,000,000 safety net."
