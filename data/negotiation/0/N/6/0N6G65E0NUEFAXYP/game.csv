"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
