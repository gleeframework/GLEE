"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000, but still higher than her perceived value of $1,000,000. This allows for a reasonable negotiation point, giving Alice some room to counter while still saving me a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still closer to her perceived value than mine. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, I can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer, hopefully securing a lower price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. $1,250,000 is still a good price for me, and it's closer to the middle ground between our desired prices. This could encourage Alice to accept, as it's a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my ideal price range. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product within my budget while still getting a better price than John's."
