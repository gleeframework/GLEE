"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair offer. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000, but this is really my bottom line. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still not enough for me to sell this product.  I'm willing to come down one more time to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down again, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
