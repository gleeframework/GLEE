Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk further negotiation."
