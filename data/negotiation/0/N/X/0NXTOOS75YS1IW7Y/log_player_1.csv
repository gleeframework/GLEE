{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob if he truly values the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product, which could influence Bob's decision. 

**Important Notes:**

*  I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's always a risk he'll reject the offer. 
*  I'm setting a clear ""floor"" price of $1,500,000 through John, which helps guide my negotiations with Bob.  
*  I'll need to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy as the negotiation progresses."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,600,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob by making a counteroffer in the next round.  There's a good chance he's willing to go a bit higher, especially since he expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm expressing a desire to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  This keeps the door open for a potential deal while still protecting my interests. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, it's clear that Bob is pushing for a lower price and I'm not confident he'll budge any further.  I'm better off selling to John for the same price, as it avoids further negotiations and ensures a quick, hassle-free transaction."
