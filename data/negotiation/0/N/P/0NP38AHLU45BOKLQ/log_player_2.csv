"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your $80 limit and not a good deal. John offers the product at a price you find acceptable."
