"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1200000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
