Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. However, I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer. If he does, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how much I'm willing to compromise. 

It's important to remember that John is a safety net, ensuring I won't lose out on a guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's not unreasonable. I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above John's guaranteed price.  I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good deal. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my own valuation of the product.  While I would have liked to get more, accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
