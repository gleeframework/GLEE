Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fantastic deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can make Bob more inclined to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, gradually lowering the price until we reach a mutually agreeable value or I decide to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is a decent amount, it's still far below the $1,000,000 minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, it's not the optimal outcome. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000. 
* I'll use this counteroffer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate further."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $850000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for improvement:** There's still a gap between our desired prices, suggesting that further negotiation might be possible.
* **Risk of losing to John:** While selling to John is tempting, it's still worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $850,000. I'll try to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum price.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and my remaining options. If he doesn't budge, I may have to consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $775000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer has not changed, indicating a stalemate. He's firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go below $825,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to further back-and-forth, wasting valuable time and energy.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit of $200,000, which is better than the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,000,000. 
* While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, selling to John ensures a comfortable profit and eliminates further negotiation."
