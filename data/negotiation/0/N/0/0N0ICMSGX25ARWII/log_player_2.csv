"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice in negotiation to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important, even while negotiating aggressively. This helps foster a more collaborative environment.
* **Signaling Interest:**  While starting low, it's good to express continued interest in the product. This shows Alice you're serious about purchasing if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice met us halfway between our initial offers, $900,000 is still significantly higher than our backup option of buying from John for $800,000. There's room for Alice to come down further.
* **Anchoring:** Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around a higher price. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're not willing to settle for a price that's too far from our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. It shows you're willing to make a deal. To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement. By proposing $700,000, we're signaling a willingness to negotiate but also holding firm to a price point closer to our target.
* **Justification:**  Lightly referencing a ""budget"" can be a useful negotiation tactic. It provides a reason for our counteroffer without revealing too much about our true valuation.
* **Seeking Compromise:** We're continuing to frame the negotiation as a collaborative effort where both parties can find a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the product at a price that fits your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has stated this is her final offer and has highlighted that she knows the product is worth $800,000 to you. This indicates she's unlikely to go any lower.
* **Minimal potential savings:**  Continuing the negotiation might result in a slightly lower price from Alice, but the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk that she won't budge from her $850,000 offer.
* **Secure the guaranteed price:** John offers a guaranteed $800,000. It makes more sense to secure this price rather than risking a higher price with Alice."
