"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. It shows you're willing to make a deal. To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the product at a price that fits your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
