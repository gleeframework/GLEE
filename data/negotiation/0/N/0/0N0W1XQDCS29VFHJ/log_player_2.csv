Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's potential.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,200,000.  This product is worth every penny of that to you, and likely even more in the long run. I'm willing to let this be my final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,200,000.  Since I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut my losses and buy from him."
