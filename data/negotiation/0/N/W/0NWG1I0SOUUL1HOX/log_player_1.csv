Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting, the product's value is significantly higher than $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I think that's a fair price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth risking a lower final price. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a solid profit."
