Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $8,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming closer to his $15,000 valuation can maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes the product's value, increasing the chance of a successful sale.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob negotiates. However, remember your bottom line is $8,000."
