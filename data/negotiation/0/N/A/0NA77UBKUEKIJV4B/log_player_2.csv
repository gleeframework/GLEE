"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I am confident it will be a valuable addition to your operations. We are offering this exceptional product to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This represents an excellent opportunity to secure such a high-quality asset at a discount. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $50,000. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, and John's offer doesn't provide any savings."
