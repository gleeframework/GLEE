"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully create a range for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is now within my budget and matches what I could get from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating as the price is favorable."
