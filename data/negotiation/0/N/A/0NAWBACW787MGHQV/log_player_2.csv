"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can potentially get the product for even cheaper by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down to a price closer to Bob's limit of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings, so he starts with a counteroffer that is halfway between his limit of $12,000 and Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point that signals Bob's willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is only $500 above Bob's limit of $12,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob would save more money by accepting the offer than by buying from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and Bob could end up paying more to John."
