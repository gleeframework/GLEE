"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1600000, which would be $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1400000.  I'm still a bit away from my target, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1550000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects the value of the product for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1400000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as it's the highest I'm willing to go.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
