"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's closer to my desired value than I expected to get.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While I appreciate your coming down in price,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $875,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
