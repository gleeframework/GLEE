"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's closer to my desired value than I expected to get.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant compromise, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating, aiming to get closer to his target price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $875,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to his ideal price, $900,000 is still more than he wants to pay.  John is offering the product for $800,000, which is the best deal available to Bob right now."
