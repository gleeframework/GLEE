"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's try $11,500. That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you given the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe the product is overvalued. I would like to propose $9,500 as a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $9,500 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,500.  This is a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose $9,800 as a fair price for the product.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close. $9,800 is a good number, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200.  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've reviewed our past negotiations and believe $9,900 represents a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. $9,900 is a good offer, but I'm really hoping for $10,000.  It's a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you. Let's finish this deal.  I'm ready to close at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,9,
