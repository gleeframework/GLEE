Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow more room for concessions.
* **Market Dynamics:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, understanding any broader market demand for the product could influence your strategy."
