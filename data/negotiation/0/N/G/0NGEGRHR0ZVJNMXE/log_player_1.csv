Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is significantly more than Bob values the product at, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob won't accept this offer immediately, but it sets a starting point and establishes my desired price range. 

Here's why this strategy is beneficial:

* **Sets the tone:**  A high initial offer signals that I value the product and am not desperate to sell.
* **Space for negotiation:** This gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, allowing us to reach a compromise.
* **Security:**  I have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a loss by being too aggressive. 

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I'm continuing to explore the possibility of a more favorable deal. Here's why:

* **Potential for compromise:**  By counter-offering, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate further. He might be willing to increase his offer slightly to avoid losing the deal altogether.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps my options open. I can still ultimately sell to John if the negotiation with Bob breaks down.
* **Setting a reasonable expectation:** A counteroffer allows me to set a realistic price that reflects the value of the product without being too aggressive. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that reflects a more favorable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,400,000 represents a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to accept his price.

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Reasonable compromise:**  It splits the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer, creating a potentially agreeable midpoint.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a loss by being too lenient.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  By showing willingness to adjust my price, I encourage Bob to reciprocate and potentially make a counteroffer closer to my desired range. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation, but I'm prepared to either accept a final offer close to $1,400,000 or revert to selling to John if the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target and leaves me feeling uneasy.  

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Risk mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a risk of a drawn-out process and a potential outcome below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's current offer.
* **Time constraints:**  Continuing to negotiate could waste valuable time, especially if the deal ultimately falls through.

By selling to John, I'm ensuring a swift and profitable transaction while minimizing potential risks and delays."
