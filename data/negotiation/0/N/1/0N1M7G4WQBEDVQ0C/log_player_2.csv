"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $12,000, you can still get the product for less from John. By rejecting the offer, you have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John if you're unable to reach a satisfactory price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my maximum budget of $8,000 as possible. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll consider adjusting my offer based on her response or moving on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get her down to my desired price. Since John is offering the product at my maximum price, it's more prudent to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
