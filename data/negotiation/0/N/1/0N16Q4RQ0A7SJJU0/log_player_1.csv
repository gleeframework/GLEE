"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still believe that $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I am willing to negotiate further if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Explanation: Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000 which is our minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer avoids further hassle and guarantees the minimum price."
