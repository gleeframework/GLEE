"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit too high for me though. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price we're both comfortable with.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $11,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
