Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, opening with a higher price ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" and implying there's other interest (""before I list it publicly""), Alice creates a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is phrased in a way that invites a counter-offer from Bob. If he rejects the initial price, Alice can always negotiate down towards his perceived value, but still aim for a price higher than John's guaranteed offer."
