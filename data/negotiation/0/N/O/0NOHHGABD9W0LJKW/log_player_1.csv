Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I'm selling. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's common to start with a higher price in negotiations to leave room for compromise. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **John as a safety net:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** I'm willing to sell the product for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need for further negotiation:**  There's no point in rejecting his offer and going through further rounds of counteroffers when I'm already at my bottom line. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the possibility of Bob backing out or failing to reach a mutually acceptable agreement in subsequent rounds."
