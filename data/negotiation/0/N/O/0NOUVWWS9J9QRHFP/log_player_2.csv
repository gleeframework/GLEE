"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,700,000. This is a significant investment, but it's a price that allows us both to make a good deal.  I understand the product is worth $800,000 to you, but  this price reflects its true value to me, and I'm confident it will be profitable for you as well. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer."
