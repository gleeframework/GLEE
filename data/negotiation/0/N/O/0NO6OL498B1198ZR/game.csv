"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. Given my current valuation, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both place on this product.  Let's work together to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While $1,000,000 is still below my initial assessment, I recognize your desire to find a solution. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This offer reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
