"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that Bob might consider, given his perceived value of $100. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm not ready to give up on a higher price with Bob yet. I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $160. This is a compromise, lowering my initial offer but still staying above my minimum. I believe this price is reasonable considering Bob's initial counteroffer and my desire to avoid selling to John at a lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is now within my minimum acceptable price range. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential delays. It's also important to note that selling to John for $150 is only a slightly better option, and the potential of further counteroffers from Bob could lead to a lower final price."
