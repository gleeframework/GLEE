"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a fair price for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
