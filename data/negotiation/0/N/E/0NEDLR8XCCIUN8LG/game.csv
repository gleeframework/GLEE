"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product has considerable value beyond what you're currently offering.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and is a fair price considering my budget. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product, but this is my final offer. This provides a significant return for you while acknowledging the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, let's finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
