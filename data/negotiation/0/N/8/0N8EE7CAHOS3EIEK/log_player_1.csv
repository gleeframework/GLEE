Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
