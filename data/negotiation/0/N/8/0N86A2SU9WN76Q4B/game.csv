"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great fit, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has a high value, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering the market and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
