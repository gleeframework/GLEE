"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $8500? It's still below my ideal price, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",8000.0,Bob,4,
