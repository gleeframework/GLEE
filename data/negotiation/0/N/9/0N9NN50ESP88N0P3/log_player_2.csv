"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to buy the product and you're willing to pay up to $100, accepting Alice's offer for $100 is the best option. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and buying from John for the same price."
