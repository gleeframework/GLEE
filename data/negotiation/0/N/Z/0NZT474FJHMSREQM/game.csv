"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal than your initial offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls quite a bit short of that.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
