"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not able to go that high. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",12750.0,Bob,4,
