(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price. Since you have 7 rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price. There's still potential to reach a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,425,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  You have 5 rounds left, so you should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. You can also use the fact that you can buy from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,425,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,375,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 as a final concession. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can close this deal, but if this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your budget, and you only have 3 rounds left. With this amount of time remaining, you are unlikely to be able to negotiate a lower price that would be acceptable to both parties.  Therefore, it's best to take the sure thing and buy from John for $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
