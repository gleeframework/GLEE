"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. 

I'm also setting a high starting point to allow for potential counteroffers and still leave room for profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'll be able to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal target.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll likely propose a price closer to my initial $1,800,000 offer, but will adjust depending on how confident I feel in the possibility of a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,700,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good price. It's above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 and is within a reasonable range of my expectations. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
