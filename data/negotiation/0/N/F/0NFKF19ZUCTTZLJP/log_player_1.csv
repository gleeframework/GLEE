"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price. It should hopefully be a reasonable offer for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum value.  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a lower offer from Bob or even reaching a stalemate outweighs the potential of getting a better price.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid selling to John for the same price."
