"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. $9,000 is a fair offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
