"Alice, your product looks great, but I'm not sure I can justify your asking price. I'm happy to pay $1300000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
