"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while establishing a strong initial position. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's ""true value"" provides a basis for the high price, even if that value is subjective.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Expressing willingness to discuss further signals flexibility and invites Bob to actively participate in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would leave potential profit on the table. I'm willing to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I have in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm taking his perspective into account, but I'm also holding firm that his initial counter was too low.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value as justification for the higher price.
* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100,000 instead of $250,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. This also gives Bob room to meet me closer to the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently meeting me halfway, which is a positive sign of his interest. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant distance from my initial offer. It appears there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence tells me you recognize the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while meeting you closer to your budget."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Acknowledging Bob's persistence helps maintain a good negotiating atmosphere and encourages him to keep engaging.
* **Smaller Concession:** I'm continuing the trend of making smaller concessions, signaling that I'm approaching my limit.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value as a way to justify the price, even as I move slightly closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is consistently halving the difference in our offers, meaning my potential gains from continuing to negotiate are shrinking.
* **Strong Offer:**  $1,325,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further risks Bob losing interest or finding alternative solutions. Accepting now secures a very good deal without unnecessary delay."
