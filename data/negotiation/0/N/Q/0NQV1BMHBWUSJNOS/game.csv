"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I have in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your persistence tells me you recognize the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth while meeting you closer to your budget.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
