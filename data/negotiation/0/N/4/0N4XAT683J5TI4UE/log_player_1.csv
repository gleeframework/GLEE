Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a 25% profit margin if Bob accepts. This is a reasonable markup for many products.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the goal is to get $150, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. This starting point leaves you space to potentially lower the price slightly and still make more than your guaranteed $120."
