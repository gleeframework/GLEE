Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, you leave some room for Bob to negotiate down if he wishes.
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still likely to get a price higher than John's offer."
