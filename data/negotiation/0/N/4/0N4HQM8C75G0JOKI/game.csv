"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $13,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'll meet you at $13,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit.",13200.0,Alice,5,
