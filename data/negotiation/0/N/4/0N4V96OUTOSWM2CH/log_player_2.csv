"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and secure the lower price."
