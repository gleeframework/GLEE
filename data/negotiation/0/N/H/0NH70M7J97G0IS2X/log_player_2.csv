"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He has a clear maximum price point ($1,200,000), and Alice's minimum is likely closer to $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore his options."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, demonstrating he's serious about a lower price. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair deal"" for both parties, creating a collaborative tone.
* **Room for Compromise:** $750,000 is still well above Alice's minimum, leaving space for negotiation."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference – I'm offering $800,000.  This would be a fair price, allowing us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```
