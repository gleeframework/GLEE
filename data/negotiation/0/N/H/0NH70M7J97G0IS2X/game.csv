"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my original offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,,
