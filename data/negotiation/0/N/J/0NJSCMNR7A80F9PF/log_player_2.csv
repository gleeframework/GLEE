"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may differ. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $100, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum price point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
