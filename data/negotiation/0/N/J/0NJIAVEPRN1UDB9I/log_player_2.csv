"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice at $1,200,000 when you can get it from John for $800,000. It's worth exploring the negotiation further to see if you can get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further to get the price down closer to my limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to make a decent deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900000 is your top limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1100000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $1,050,000, which is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John. Even though I'd prefer to get it from Alice, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
