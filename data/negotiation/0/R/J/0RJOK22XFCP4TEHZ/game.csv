"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This price reflects its exceptional qualities and potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $1800000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your counteroffer,  $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products and the potential return on investment.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get the sense that we may be a bit far apart on price. While I appreciate your persistence,  $1300000 simply doesn't cover the true value of this unique product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to drop to $1500000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1500000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're getting closer.  $1350000 is a good offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm going to come down to $1450000. This is a final offer, and a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident that you'll be happy with the value this product brings. Let's get this deal done.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
