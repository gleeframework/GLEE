Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your counteroffer,  $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get the sense that we may be a bit far apart on price. While I appreciate your persistence,  $1300000 simply doesn't cover the true value of this unique product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to drop to $1500000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.
