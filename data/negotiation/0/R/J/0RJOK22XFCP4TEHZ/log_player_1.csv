Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth $1800000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I want to see if he's truly interested in this product and is willing to come closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your counteroffer,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll try to push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get the sense that we may be a bit far apart on price. While I appreciate your persistence,  $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover the true value of this unique product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to drop to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I want to see if I can push him a little further before considering John's offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've reached a point where Bob is not willing to budge much further. We're only $25,000 away from a deal with Bob, but I'm starting to run out of time and rounds. It's a risky move, but given the limited rounds left and the close proximity to my minimum, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
