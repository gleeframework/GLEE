"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  This is a fairer offer considering the potential returns you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  I can offer $700,000, and I think that's a very fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $700,000 is still too low.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than reasonable considering the value you'll receive.",950000.0,Alice,5,
