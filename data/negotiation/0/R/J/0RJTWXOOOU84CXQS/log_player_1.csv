Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential. To be fair, I'm not comfortable with that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.
