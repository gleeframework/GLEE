Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and  willing to hear Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Leverage:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000, so I can afford to be firm.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (fair price for both).
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end the message by asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling that I'm still open to discussion. 
* **Leverage:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so I have the luxury of not settling for an unreasonably low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my counteroffer of $9,500, and it's significantly higher than his initial offer of $8,000.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or John's offer might expire. It's better to secure a sale now.
* **Profit Margin:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, so I'm still making a profit."
