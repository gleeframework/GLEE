""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal!"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's valuation matches mine, he's starting at his maximum price.  There's little chance of negotiating him higher. It's safer to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
