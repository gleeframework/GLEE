"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8,250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $8,250 is getting closer, but it's still a touch above my limit. How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,750. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",7750.0,Alice,7,
