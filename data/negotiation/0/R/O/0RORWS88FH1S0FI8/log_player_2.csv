Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000.

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than John's offer.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal than John's $800,000 offer."
