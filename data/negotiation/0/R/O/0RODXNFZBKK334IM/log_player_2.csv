"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than you'd be willing to pay elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you need to pay. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $250,000."
