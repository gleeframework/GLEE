Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to be made.
* **Your Safety Net:** John guarantees you'll get your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and represents a significant benefit to you. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Professional and respectful, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Price Justification:**  The price is framed as beneficial to Bob, highlighting the value he gains. 
* **Time Limit:** Creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Why this price?**

* **Profitable:**  You secure a $150,000 profit, which is a 12.5% gain on your minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Bob saves $150,000 compared to his perceived value, a strong incentive to buy.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly if Bob counters. However, don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum. You have a guaranteed buyer in John."
