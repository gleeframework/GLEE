"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $135, which is a significant discount from my original price. Would you be interested in that?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? ",117.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $117.50 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do $125, which is a bit closer to your offer. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Alice,5,
