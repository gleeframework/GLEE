"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget though. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? ",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
