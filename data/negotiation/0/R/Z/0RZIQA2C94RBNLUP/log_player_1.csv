Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high.  If he rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer just yet. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

```

It seems Bob is firm on $100.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation with him.  John is guaranteed to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
