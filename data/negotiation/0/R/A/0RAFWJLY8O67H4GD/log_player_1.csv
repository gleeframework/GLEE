Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 profit margin.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while maximizing your potential profit.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed amount.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value (""significant to you"") without explicitly stating his potential profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could aim slightly lower to increase the chance of Bob accepting, but that also means potentially leaving money on the table."
