"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth a significant amount to me, so I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree that this product is valuable, but the price point you've presented is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll take it seriously.",800000.0,Alice,5,
