"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your actual target price. This gives you room to move upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counter-offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial price, it might be better to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial.  I could come down to $1,900,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice dropped her price significantly, it's still substantially higher than both our budget and John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice stating  ""final offer"" could be a negotiation tactic. By rejecting it, we test her resolve and see if there's any more room for movement.
* **John as Backup:** We still have the security of purchasing from John at our target price if needed."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go as high as $1,250,000. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Below Budget:**  We want to show Alice we're serious but stay well within our budget. This counteroffer represents a considerable jump from our previous one while still leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we remind Alice that we have a viable alternative (John) and aren't desperate to close the deal with her. This might encourage her to be more flexible. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We continue to engage in the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious and I'm trying to find a middle ground.  Let's make this our final exchange - $1,600,000. This is taking into account the significant value this product offers.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginally Above Budget:** While Alice's price is getting closer, it's still slightly above our budget and what John offers. 
* **One Last Push:** Even though Alice presented this as her ""final exchange,"" it might be worth one more counter-offer. There's a possibility she's willing to meet us at our target price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  We can always fall back on John's offer if Alice refuses to budge further."

{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort you've made to find a compromise.  Honestly, my absolute limit is $1,500,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer, Firmly Stated:** We're laying all our cards on the table, presenting our budget as our absolute limit. This leaves no room for interpretation and sets a clear boundary.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""ready to close the deal right now,"" we inject a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage Alice to make a decision quickly.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** We've reached our limit. If Alice doesn't agree to $1,500,000, we're prepared to walk away and buy from John at that price."
