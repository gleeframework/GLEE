Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired range by counter-offering Bob."
