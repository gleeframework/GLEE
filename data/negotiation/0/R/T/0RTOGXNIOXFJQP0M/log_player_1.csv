Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your absolute bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a little.
* **Understanding Value:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and your minimum is $800,000. This means there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be split. 
* **Targeting a Favorable Split:** Offering the product at $925,000 aims to capture a larger portion of that surplus for yourself while still leaving Bob with a significant benefit ($75,000) compared to not purchasing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle and still secure a price well above your minimum."
