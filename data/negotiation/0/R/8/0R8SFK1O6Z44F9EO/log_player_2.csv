"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your operations. I understand its worth to you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price represents a fair value for both of us, allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Please let me know your decision.  If you decline, I will be moving forward with another buyer who is interested in acquiring the product at a lower price.
