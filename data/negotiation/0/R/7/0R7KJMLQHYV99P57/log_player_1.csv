"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a little more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good profit.  I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to haggle.  I'm happy with $850,000, especially considering the time constraints."
