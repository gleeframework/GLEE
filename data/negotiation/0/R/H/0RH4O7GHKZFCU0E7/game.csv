"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. I could consider coming down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant investment for you, but also ensures you acquire a valuable asset.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about $1,350,000?  This would allow you to still achieve a good profit while keeping the deal within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
