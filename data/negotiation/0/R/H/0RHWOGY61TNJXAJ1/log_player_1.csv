Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum, and I've only got 4 rounds left. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
