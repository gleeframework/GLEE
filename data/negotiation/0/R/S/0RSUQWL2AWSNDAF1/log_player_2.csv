"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
