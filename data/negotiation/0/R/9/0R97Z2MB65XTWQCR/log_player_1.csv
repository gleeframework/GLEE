{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me some flexibility."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good starting point, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
