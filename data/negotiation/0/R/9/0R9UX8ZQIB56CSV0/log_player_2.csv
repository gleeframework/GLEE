"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, and Alice's offer is above Bob's desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point, but it's closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be reached before deciding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and sell the product to you for $1,315,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal.  He has a guaranteed deal with John for a lower price, and the time constraint makes continuing negotiations with Alice a risky proposition."
