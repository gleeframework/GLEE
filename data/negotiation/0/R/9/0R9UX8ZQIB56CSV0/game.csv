"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and sell the product to you for $1,315,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
