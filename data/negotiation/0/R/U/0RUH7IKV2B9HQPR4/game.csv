"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference at $115. That seems fair considering the value we both see in the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
