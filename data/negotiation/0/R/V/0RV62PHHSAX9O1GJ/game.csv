"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $10,750.  Let's try to make this work.",10750.0,Bob,4,
