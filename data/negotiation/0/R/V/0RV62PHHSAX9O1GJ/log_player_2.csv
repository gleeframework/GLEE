"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.
