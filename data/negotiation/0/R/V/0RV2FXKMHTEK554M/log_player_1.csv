Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum threshold. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, while leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum threshold and a good deal considering the negotiation.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
