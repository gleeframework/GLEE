"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, however, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that be feasible?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $8,500. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product",9000.0,Alice,5,
