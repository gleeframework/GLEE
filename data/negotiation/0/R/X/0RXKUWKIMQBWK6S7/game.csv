"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $650,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a compromise, as it's still a significant discount from my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $812,500. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to accept, I'll sell the product to you at this price. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",812500.0,Alice,5,
