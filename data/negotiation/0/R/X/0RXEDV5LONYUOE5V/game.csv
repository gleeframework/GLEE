"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price is higher than I had in mind. I would be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the value of the product is recognized.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  However, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I can go as high as $1,100,000, but that's my limit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move on the price.  I've been evaluating the potential of this product carefully, and I believe it can generate significantly more value for you in the long run. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a substantial adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair and mutually beneficial offer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the serious interest I have in acquiring this product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and see the potential synergy with you. Therefore, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair price for this unique product.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
