,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $13750? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $12875?",12875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12875. How about we try $14000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can we try to meet in the middle once more?",1300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $13500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
