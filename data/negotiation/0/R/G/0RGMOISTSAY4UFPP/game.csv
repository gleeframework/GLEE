,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $100.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not able to go above $125.  Would you be willing to come down a little more?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $150. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",150.0,Alice,5,
