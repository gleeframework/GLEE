"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
