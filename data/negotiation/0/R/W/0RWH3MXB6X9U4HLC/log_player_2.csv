# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $875,000 is a good price, saving you $125,000 compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer."
