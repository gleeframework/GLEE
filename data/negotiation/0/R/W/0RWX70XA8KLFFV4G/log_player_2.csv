"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $950,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's the most expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still offering a price that is likely higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is closer to your desired price point, it's still higher than your ideal. Rejecting the offer again allows for further negotiation.  Buying from John is always a fallback option, but it's significantly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your previous offer by $50,000, showing Alice that you are willing to compromise but still aiming for a price that is beneficial to you.  This approach attempts to bridge the gap between the two offers and potentially reach an agreement closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price or a stalemate. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is still significantly lower than buying from John. While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price with further negotiation, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
