"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  This also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come up in price.  I'll counter with a lower offer than my initial price, but still above the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,500,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that much.  I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, selling to John becomes a more tempting option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price much further, especially with John waiting in the wings.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 seems like the safest and most profitable option."
