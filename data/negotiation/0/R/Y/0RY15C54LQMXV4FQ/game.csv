"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not ready to commit to $900000.  I believe a more realistic price for this product is $750000. I'm confident it's a fair value considering your stated worth.  Let's start there, and see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to lower my price to $850000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still above my target.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering your own assessment of the product's value.  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to lower my price to $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
