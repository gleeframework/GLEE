"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",700000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me. Could you consider $675,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",675000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,725000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you halfway and given you a significant discount. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm counteroffering at $725,000, as you suggested, but I'm only willing to go this low because I think the product is worth it to you. I'm not budging further.",725000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,720000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I don't think splitting the difference is quite fair considering the value I know you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $720,000, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the product's true value.",720000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, we're getting close!  I understand you value the product, and I'm willing to offer $710,000. That's only $10,000 away from your last counter, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",710000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,715000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $710,000, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $715,000, which is still a good deal for you, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer.",715000.0,Alice,9,,
