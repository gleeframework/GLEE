"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you set a high anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, even if he ultimately negotiates down. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price significantly above both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) gives you ample space to make concessions during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Holding Firm:**  You are acknowledging Bob's counteroffer by reducing your price, showing flexibility. However, you are still holding firm well above both his offer and your minimum price.
* **Aiming for Above Average:** By proposing $1,400,000, you're aiming for a price that's above the average between your initial offer and his counteroffer. This leaves room for further negotiation while still pushing for a strong profit. 
* **Maintaining a Confident Tone:**  You are not expressing desperation to sell. By using phrases like ""significantly below its value,"" you reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm still looking to keep the cost lower. Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $50,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal to John's standing offer of $1,200,000 increases. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk ending up with less.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer in a reasonable timeframe can help build a positive business relationship, potentially leading to future opportunities."
