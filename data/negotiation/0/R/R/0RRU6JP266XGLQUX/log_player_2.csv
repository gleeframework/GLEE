"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so he offers $9,000 as a starting point.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might make her more inclined to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,000.  While this is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to avoid further negotiations and simply buy from John."
