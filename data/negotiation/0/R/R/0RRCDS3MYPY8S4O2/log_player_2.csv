"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $130, which is less than the $150 John would charge.
* **You still save money:**  Even though you are paying more than the product is worth to Alice ($100), you are still saving $20 compared to buying from John."
