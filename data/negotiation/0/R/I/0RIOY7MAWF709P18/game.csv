"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair deal, as the product is worth the same to you as it is to me. If you decline, I'll have no choice but to sell it to John for the same amount. I believe you'll find this to be a good opportunity, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
