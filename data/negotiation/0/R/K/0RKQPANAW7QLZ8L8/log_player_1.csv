Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefit for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" and the price being ""significantly below"" my own valuation. This encourages acceptance.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still setting a firm initial price.
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup at $1,500,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more assertive and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** My product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Space:** I have room to negotiate. Bob's offer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the power to hold out for a better price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a deal that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he's getting. 
* **Clear Goal:** I'm aiming to reach a price that's closer to my desired range while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiations if Bob is still hesitant.

This counteroffer provides a good balance between pushing for a higher price while still being reasonable and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $1,050,000 would mean selling the product for significantly less than its value to me ($1,500,000).
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** Bob's statement that $1,050,000 is his ""lowest"" implies little room for further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly better than accepting Bob's offer.

While I would prefer to sell the product to Bob, maximizing my profit is my priority.  Selling to John ensures a much better outcome, making it the best decision in this situation."
