"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!
