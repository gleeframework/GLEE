It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially get a better price than $900,000."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my initial goal was to spend no more than $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and finalizing the purchase."
