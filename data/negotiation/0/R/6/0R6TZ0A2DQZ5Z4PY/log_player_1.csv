Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $110? This is a really good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $105 is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
