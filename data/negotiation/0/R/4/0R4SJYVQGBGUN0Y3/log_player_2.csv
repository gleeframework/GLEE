"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item, and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I believe you'll find it's a great investment. My initial offer is $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the item."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $9,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer is still too high, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely she will come down to a price that works for Bob.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price and avoids any further negotiation."
