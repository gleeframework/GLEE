Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80 for the product. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to $150 will maximize your profit, but you need to leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $80.

Offering $130 gives Bob a $20 discount, which is a significant saving, while netting you a $50 profit over your minimum. This strategy balances profit maximization with a higher likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
