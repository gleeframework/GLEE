"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the [Product name/description]. I appreciate the thought, but my budget is quite limited. I was wondering if it's possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
