Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,225,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer the product to you for $1,280,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice has signaled this is her final offer and it's a reasonable price. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $220,000 less than John's price and $120,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Pushing further could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
