"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is $2,000 above your maximum price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum. You can still try to negotiate a lower price. Since you're already nearing the middle ground, you might get closer to your goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that.  However, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about we settle at $11250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to $11,250.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are getting smaller and smaller.  You've already made it clear that $11,000 is your limit.  It's better to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better deal.  You'll save more in the long run."
