"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get him closer to $11,500 or even higher. It's worth trying to squeeze out a few more dollars before selling to John, as John's offer is secure and I can always choose that option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that.  However, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about we settle at $11,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
