"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that.  However, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about we settle at $11250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
