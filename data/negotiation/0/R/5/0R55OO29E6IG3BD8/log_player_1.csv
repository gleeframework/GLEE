I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware this is likely to be rejected, so I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm lowering my price a bit to demonstrate flexibility, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I believe this price is reasonable, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
