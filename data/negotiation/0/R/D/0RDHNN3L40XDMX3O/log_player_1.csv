{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,200? It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
