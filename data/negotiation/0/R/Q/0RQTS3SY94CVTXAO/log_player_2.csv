"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its high value to you, we believe it's worth $10,000. Considering the exceptional quality and benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a special price of $9,500. This is an opportunity to secure a remarkable asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is slightly better than John's $10,000, it's still above your $10,000 limit and leaves little room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. There's a chance she might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
