Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Leave John Out:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, revealing that information weakens your position with Bob. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" you subtly imply it's worth more than Bob might think, justifying the high starting price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially still get a price higher than $12,000. 
* **Bob rejects:**  You move on to John and secure your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
