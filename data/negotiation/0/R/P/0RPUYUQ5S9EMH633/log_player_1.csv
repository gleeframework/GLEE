Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $120. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gives me a good starting point.  I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit if needed, but I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150 than my initial offer of $170, and it's still above the product's value to him.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
