Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think it's a great deal for the value you'll receive."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 (its worth to John), starting high might scare Bob away. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Offering it at $125 is a compromise. It's more than Bob values it at inherently, but the potential value proposition might entice him, and it's still a profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy it at $150, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines."
