Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit.  Starting high and allowing room for negotiation is a common tactic.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussion."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is just below your guaranteed amount from John, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Open to Discussion:** The language encourages negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's ""unique value,"" aiming to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information about Bob (e.g., his personality, how badly he needs the product), you might adjust your offer and messaging."
