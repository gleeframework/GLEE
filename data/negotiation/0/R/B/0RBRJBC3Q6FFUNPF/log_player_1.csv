Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Showing confidence by starting high can sometimes encourage Bob to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired amount by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer.  While I want to maximize my profit, it seems like further negotiations with Bob might not yield a significantly better result. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'll sell to John for $8,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of Bob declining again."
