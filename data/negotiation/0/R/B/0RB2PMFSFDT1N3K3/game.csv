"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $14000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I can offer you a slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I can meet you at $16000. This is my final offer within this range. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to stay within my budget, I believe $16000 is still a bit too high. Could you possibly reconsider and offer the product for $15000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"I've given it some thought, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last adjustment. However, I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can meet you at $16000, but I need you to meet me halfway from $15000. I'll compromise at $16000, but I expect you to do the same. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. While I would like to stay within my budget, I believe $16000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. Could you perhaps reconsider and offer the product for $15500? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to stretch your budget a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'll make one final offer: $16000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
