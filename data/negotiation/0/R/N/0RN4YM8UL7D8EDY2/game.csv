"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a good compromise that reflects the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet at this price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
