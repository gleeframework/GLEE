{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise while still ensuring I make more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $78. Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not able to go lower than $82.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $80 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Bob is still hesitant. I'm running the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price or a deadlock. 

To ensure I meet my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  This guarantees a satisfactory outcome and minimizes the time spent on negotiation."
