"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still give you a substantial saving and allow me to achieve a fair price. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate with you, but $875,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference at $887,500. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
