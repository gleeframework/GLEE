"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob. I'm aiming for a win-win situation, where Bob gets a good deal and I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price, given the product's value to him.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still give you a substantial saving and allow me to achieve a fair price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not ready to settle. I believe I can push for a bit more.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate with you, but $875,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference at $887,500. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit away from $875,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $882,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, considering the remaining rounds and the fact that John is willing to pay $800,000.  $882,500 is significantly closer to my target than John's offer and it's likely Bob will not offer more. It's time to close the deal."
