"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your original offer and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
