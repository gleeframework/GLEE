"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer considering I could get it from another seller for $15,000.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",18000.0,Alice,5,
