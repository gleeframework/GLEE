"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still too high. We'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer considering I could get it from another seller for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

We're getting closer to a price that works for us. This counter-offer puts a little pressure on Alice by mentioning the other offer, but leaves room for her to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $18,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is firm on her price and unwilling to budge much further. Since her final offer of $18,000 is higher than John's offer of $15,000, it's more beneficial to buy from John at this point."
