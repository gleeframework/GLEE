Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. There's always a chance Bob might come back with a higher offer, but I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely."
