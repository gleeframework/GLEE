"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is more than his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $825,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  He can either counteroffer or consider buying from John if the negotiation doesn't yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
