{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that tries to maximize my profit while also being reasonable enough to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still try to get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob!  I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $112 is my absolute lowest price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $109? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $109 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for less.  It's time to take the deal and secure the profit."
