"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? That still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise, considering my budget. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise.  While $115 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $105, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
