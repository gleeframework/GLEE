"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer! While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $85 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $95 is the middle ground, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we go with $97.50? That's only a small increase, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",97.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $97.50 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,8,
