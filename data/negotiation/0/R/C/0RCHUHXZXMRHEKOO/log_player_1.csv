"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's still worth more to sell to John.  I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! While I appreciate your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth it to me.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $85 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $95 is the middle ground, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal from him."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we go with $97.50? That's only a small increase, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $97.50 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I could keep negotiating with Bob, I've only got 2 rounds left and I'm not confident that I can get him to accept a price closer to my minimum.  It's better to sell to John and be sure of a good profit."
