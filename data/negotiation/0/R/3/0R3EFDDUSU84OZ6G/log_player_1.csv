Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has signaled that $750,000 is his ""final offer."" While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to our desired price. Accepting his offer means losing out on a potential $50,000. Selling to John for $800,000 is the safer and more profitable option at this point."
