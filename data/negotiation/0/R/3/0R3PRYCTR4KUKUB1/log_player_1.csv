Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $900,000 is higher than $800,000, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, allowing room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong starting position:**  A firm opening price shows confidence and sets the tone for the negotiation. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's value, I'm giving him some room to bargain while still keeping the negotiation in my favor. If Bob rejects, I can always make a counteroffer or simply sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.  It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Fair price:** $850,000 is a reasonable price for Bob, as it's still less than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for further negotiation, as I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer of $900,000. 

By offering a slightly lower price while also emphasizing the value to Bob, I'm hoping to encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round. 

I believe I can still push for a higher price, as Bob has already shown he's willing to pay more than his initial offer of $700,000.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a better outcome, but I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still remaining within my acceptable price range.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which helps justify the price.
* **Final offer?:**  This counteroffer might be my final offer if Bob doesn't accept. If he rejects again, I might be ready to sell to John for $1,000,000.

By offering a price closer to Bob's initial offer and highlighting the value he'll get, I'm aiming to encourage him to accept and finalize the deal."
