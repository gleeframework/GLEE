Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is below your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product. By offering a slightly lower price, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, but you still have room to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price than to accept his offer.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is the exact value of the product to him. Accepting this offer allows you to maximize your profit with Bob, as he is unlikely to offer any more.  While selling to John for $150 is more profitable, it's risky since there's no guarantee John will be available or that he'll still be interested in buying later."
