Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and emphasize the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. This initial offer establishes a starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still leaving some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer. However, I have the safety net of John's offer, which ensures I don't have to accept anything lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value is only $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While his offer is close to his perceived value, it's far too low for me to consider. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting his offer, I maintain my negotiating position and demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. It's a crucial step in securing a better deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the market value,  $9,500 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this item. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,000. It's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $11,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer but firmly expressing that it's too low. I'm using positive language while remaining firm in my stance. I'm also highlighting the value of the product again to remind him of its worth. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground without sacrificing too much profit. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider his next offer carefully and decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I am not willing to sacrifice so much profit at this point.

**Strategy:**

I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own. I want to see if I can push him just a little bit higher before potentially settling for a slightly lower price. My goal is to maximize my profit while still considering the possibility of selling to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,800.  That's a good step in the right direction, but I'm still just a little too far apart.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $11,400, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's latest offer of $10,800.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's progress and express willingness to compromise. I also reiterate the value of the product to emphasize its worth.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. By meeting him halfway, I'm signaling my willingness to reach a deal while keeping the possibility of selling to John open. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to accept his final counteroffer or sell to John for a guaranteed higher price."
