Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the market value,  $9,500 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this item. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,000. It's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
