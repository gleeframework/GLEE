Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product for $100 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($120). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is your initial offer, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's really interested. 
* **Avoiding a ""Lowball"" Impression:**  Offering a price too close to $80 might make Bob think the product is worth even less, making negotiation difficult. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a price he might find acceptable."
