Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why not $15,000?**  While that's my minimum, I know Bob won't accept that. He values it at $12,000.
* **Why $14,500?** This is a compromise. It's higher than what Bob values it at, but lower than what I can get from John. It gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while still allowing me to make a profit. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my chances of getting a good price while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
