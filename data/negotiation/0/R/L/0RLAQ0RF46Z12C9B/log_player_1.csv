Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll find it incredibly useful. I'm asking for $160 to start negotiations."", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for my budget though.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is too low for me. Could you do $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $80. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
