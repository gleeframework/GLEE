"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I think it's a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still within your budget of $1,200,000 and saves you $100,000."
