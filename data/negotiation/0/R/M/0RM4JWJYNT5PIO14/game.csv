"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This gives us both some room to work with. ",95.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Could you possibly consider meeting me halfway?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $90.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's the best I can offer.  If you're not able to meet me halfway at $90, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",90.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Unfortunately, I still can't meet you at $90. I would like to propose $85 as my final offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
