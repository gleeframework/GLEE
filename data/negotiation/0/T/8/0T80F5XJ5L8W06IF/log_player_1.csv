Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **High Starting Point:**  The initial offer is high, giving me leverage and room to negotiate downward.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to make counteroffers if necessary, but I will always keep my minimum price of $1,500,000 in mind.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having a backup buyer like John gives me the confidence to walk away from a deal if it doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'd get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to take $850,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiations or by selling to John.  

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I need to find a price that is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for some negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the need to find a price that's fair for both of us.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further by suggesting a ""meeting in the middle.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm at $900,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to find a price point that is closer to my minimum but still allows for some compromise.  I'll also continue to keep my options open and consider selling to John if a suitable deal with Bob can't be reached."
