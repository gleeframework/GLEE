Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept it.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is lower than Alice's original offer, it's still above your budget.  Let's see if we can negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $950,000 is still more than you would like to pay, it's closer to your budget than what John is offering.  It seems like Alice is willing to come down to a fair price, and it's likely that any further negotiation will take us even longer. Let's accept the offer and move forward."
