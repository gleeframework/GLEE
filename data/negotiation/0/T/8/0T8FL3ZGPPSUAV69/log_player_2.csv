You can definitely do better than $110.  Let's see if we can get Alice closer to your $80 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a middle ground offer of $90.  It's still a decent deal for Alice, but closer to what I'm willing to pay."

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at my desired price. Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can get her to budge further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's offer $95.  It's a small increase from my last offer, but hopefully enough to show Alice I'm serious about getting this deal done, but not willing to go much higher."

We're getting closer, but $98 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter one more time to see if I can get Alice to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 93}

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway on the price. If she doesn't accept, I'll buy from John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice isn't budging, and it's getting close to the end of our rounds.  I'm going to go ahead and buy from John. It's a better price for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely."
