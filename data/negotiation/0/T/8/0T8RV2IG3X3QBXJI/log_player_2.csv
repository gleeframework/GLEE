"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer on this exclusive product, Bob. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Would you be willing to purchase the product from me for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay and more expensive than buying from John. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
