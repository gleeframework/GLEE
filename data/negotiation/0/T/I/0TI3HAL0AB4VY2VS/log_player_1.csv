"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500.  While I would prefer a higher price, I'm running out of time and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a stalemate is too high.  $12,500 is significantly better than selling to John and it's a good compromise."
