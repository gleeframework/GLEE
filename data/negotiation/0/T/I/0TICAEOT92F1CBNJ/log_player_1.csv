"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. I'm optimistic that Bob will be willing to negotiate and find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly to $9,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good compromise.  It's a substantial profit for me, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. It's  better to secure a deal now than risk losing him and potentially having to sell to John for less."
