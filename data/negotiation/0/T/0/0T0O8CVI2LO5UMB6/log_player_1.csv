Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. We've gone through several rounds, and it seems Bob won't budge further.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
