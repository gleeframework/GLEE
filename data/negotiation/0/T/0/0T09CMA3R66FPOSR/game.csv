"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I understand that you're being firm with your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",990000.0,Bob,6,
