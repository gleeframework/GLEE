# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
