Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get at least $15,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's counteroffer is within my acceptable range, and it's closer to my initial ask than John's offer.  I'll accept it and secure the sale."
