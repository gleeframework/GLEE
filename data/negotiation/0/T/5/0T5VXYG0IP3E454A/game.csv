"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is a significant concession from my original price. I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm really interested in this product and want to make this deal work. Would you consider a price of $12,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your flexibility. I can go up to $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,9,
