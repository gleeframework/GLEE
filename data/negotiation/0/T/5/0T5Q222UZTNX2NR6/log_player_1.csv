{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you are still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a $500 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for back-and-forth negotiations. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, given my budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to try to push Bob higher with a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a fair price, it's just a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me achieve my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair price, and it would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I believe I can get closer to my $9,000 target with another counteroffer.  It's worth trying one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
