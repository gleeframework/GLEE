"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a little high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
