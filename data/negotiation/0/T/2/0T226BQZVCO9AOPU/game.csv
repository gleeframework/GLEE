"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $7,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to make this deal work.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to my budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make it work.",7200.0,Bob,6,
