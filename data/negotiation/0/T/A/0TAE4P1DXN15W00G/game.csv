"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $11,500 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
