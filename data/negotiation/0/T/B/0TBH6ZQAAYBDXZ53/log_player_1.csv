"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below the minimum value I've placed on the product ($1,000,000).  I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this unique product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,200,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to ensure a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to accept it. I want to see if I can push for a bit more and possibly reach a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be flexible.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. I'm proposing a final price of $980,000. This would allow me to move forward with the sale, and I believe it still presents a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 980000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $960000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm hesitant to accept it. The risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially ending in a lower price than John's guaranteed offer is too high.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a safe and secure outcome."
