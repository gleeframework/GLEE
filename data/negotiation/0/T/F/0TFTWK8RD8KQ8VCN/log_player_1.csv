""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for profit while still being attractive to Bob. He gains $1,000 in value ($15,000 - $14,000). 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

By starting at $14,000, you leave yourself room to potentially negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your minimum selling point."
