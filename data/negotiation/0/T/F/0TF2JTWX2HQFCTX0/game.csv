"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,050,000? This recognizes the value it holds while still acknowledging your investment.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $2,050,000. How about we try $1,700,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor.  While $1,700,000 is a significant offer, the value this product represents makes it hard to go that low.  My final offer is $1,900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
