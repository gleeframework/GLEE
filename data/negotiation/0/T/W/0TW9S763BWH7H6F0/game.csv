"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit far from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, as I'm already making a significant concession.  I hope you'll agree it's a fair price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",10000.0,Bob,6,
