"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I value this product at closer to $800,000. To be fair to you, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your initial valuation, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I need to see the price closer to my initial valuation to make this work. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. I believe this is a generous offer considering the value this product brings. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your movement, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling for this product is $800,000. I understand that may not align with your valuation, but I'm willing to offer you $700,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,6,
