Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
