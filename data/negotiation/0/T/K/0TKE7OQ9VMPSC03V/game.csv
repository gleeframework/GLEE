"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
