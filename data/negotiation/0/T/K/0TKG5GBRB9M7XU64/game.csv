"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's split the difference at $105. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $107? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",107.0,Alice,5,
