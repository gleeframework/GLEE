"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is the best possible deal for Bob.  It's below his maximum price point of $15,000 and saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John. There's no reason to risk a counteroffer that might be rejected or lead to a higher price."
