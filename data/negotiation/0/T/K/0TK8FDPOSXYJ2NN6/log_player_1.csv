Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but seems anchored at $1,225,000.  While we could push for a bit more, there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:** We're already close on price.  Further haggling might yield little gain.
* **Losing Bob:**  He could walk away entirely, leaving us with John's $800,000 offer.

$1,225,000 is a significant profit above our minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially small increase."
