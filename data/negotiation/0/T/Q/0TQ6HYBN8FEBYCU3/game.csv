"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify paying around $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. If you're still interested, let me know!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I'd be comfortable with. How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. I can do $1,250,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
