"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value for the product.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum value for the product.  While I would prefer to get more, it's a fair price and will allow me to close the deal quickly.  I'm also hesitant to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale.  Accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point."
