"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. This puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate. If she's serious about selling, she'll likely counter with a price closer to $7,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above Bob's ideal price.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.  By emphasizing a quick deal, Bob is also trying to motivate Alice to accept."
