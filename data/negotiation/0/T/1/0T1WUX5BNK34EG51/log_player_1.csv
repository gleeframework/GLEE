"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm setting the bar high to see if he's genuinely interested. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to establish a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,500,000 target by continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.  I believe this price is attractive enough to keep Bob engaged and potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can achieve a higher price by continuing to negotiate. The difference between his offer and my target is still significant enough to warrant further rounds.  I'm also mindful of the dwindling rounds; I need to balance the risk of getting a lower price with the chance of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive in closing the deal. This price is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still represents a substantial profit for me. It also allows me to test Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I might have to consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  We are getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and the risk of not getting a better price is growing.  However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum desired profit margin. I will make a counteroffer to try to close the deal for a slightly better price, but I will be prepared to accept John's offer in the next round if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

This is my final push to secure a higher price from Bob. $1,175,000 is a slight increase from his last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a deal with Bob is too high. Even though I'm not happy with the price, it's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John. It's better to get $1,000,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
