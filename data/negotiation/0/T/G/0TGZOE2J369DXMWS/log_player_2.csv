Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $80 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $65. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 65}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $70 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $68 for the product, which reflects its value while staying within my budget. Would you be willing to consider that offer?"", ""product_price"": 68}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I'm willing to offer the product at $69. I hope this price works for you, and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $69. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $69
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$69 is very close to my target price of $65. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and it's likely I won't be able to get a significantly better price. Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
