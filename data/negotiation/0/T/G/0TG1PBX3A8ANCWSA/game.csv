"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product is quite valuable and $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
