"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting high ($1,800,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, giving me bargaining power.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" anchors the price to the product's worth, not just a random number.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrasing ""starting point"" signals willingness to negotiate, preventing Bob from being immediately discouraged.

This strategy aims for a high initial offer while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your starting price is far above my budget. To begin a meaningful negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects its value while allowing both of us to achieve a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round to steer the negotiation closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial long-term value, and to make a deal worthwhile for both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement and Rejection:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to maintain good faith but clearly state it's unacceptable. 
* **Justification:** I reiterate the product's long-term value, subtly reminding Bob he might be undervaluing it.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** My counteroffer is a $200,000 decrease, showing movement but still holding a strong position above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  
* **Aim for Compromise:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a compromise within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and I risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations."
