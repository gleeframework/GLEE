"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your starting price is far above my budget. To begin a meaningful negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects its value while allowing both of us to achieve a successful transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial long-term value, and to make a deal worthwhile for both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise considering both our interests.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
