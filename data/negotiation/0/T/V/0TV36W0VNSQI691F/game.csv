"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this conversation.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I feel the true value of this product sits a bit higher. Would you consider $1,130,000? This reflects its significance while acknowledging your perspective.",1130000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,130,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of your initial offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1080000.0,Bob,4,
