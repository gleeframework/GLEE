"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1300000?  This still leaves a healthy profit margin for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find common ground!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1250000? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get this deal done, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, and I'm committed to making this deal work. While $1250000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1325000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. Can you consider my offer?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
