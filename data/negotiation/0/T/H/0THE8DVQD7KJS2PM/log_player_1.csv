Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its quality and features. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's valuation matches my minimum, I'm not willing to go any lower than my initial offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees a clean transaction at my desired price."
