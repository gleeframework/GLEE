```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Change:** Alice's offer is only a small reduction from her previous one. This suggests that further negotiation might be difficult.

* **Better Alternative:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed option, even though it's more expensive. Given the limited time and uncertainty of further negotiation, it's a safer and more predictable choice."
