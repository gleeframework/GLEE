Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm looking to get $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you taking a look at my product. $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm open to discussion."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. Can we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll try to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really close to agreeing with you. $92.50 is not quite enough, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While $95 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum price.  Since I can get $100 from John, I'm going to take that option."
