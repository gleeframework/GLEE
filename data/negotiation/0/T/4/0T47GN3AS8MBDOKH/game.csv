"Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm looking to get $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you taking a look at my product. $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm open to discussion.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. Can we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really close to agreeing with you. $92.50 is not quite enough, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
