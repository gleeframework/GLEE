"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13500? That would be a fair compromise and still a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. I'm trying to save as much money as possible, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,4,
