"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13500? That would be a fair compromise and still a good deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
