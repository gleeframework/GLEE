"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the time constraints, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000.  It's a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close to the deadline, but I'm still not willing to budge from my minimum price of $11,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free consultation to make sure you get the most out of the product. This is a unique opportunity to get a top-notch product with added value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,9,
