Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I make a good profit.
* It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.

This approach allows for potential negotiation, maximizing my potential earnings while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
