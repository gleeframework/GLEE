"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as an opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower my price if necessary. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer than his initial perceived value, it's still not worth it to me to accept. I'm confident I can secure a higher price with further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to bring him closer to my desired price. If he doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John at any time, securing my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this unique product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum. 
* **Value emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's self-interest.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to find a middle ground with this counteroffer. If Bob still refuses, I'll consider lowering my price further in the next round.  However, I'll always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I believe we can find common ground at $1,550,000. This price respects the value of your product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale over potentially pushing for a higher price and risking Bob walking away.  With 6 rounds remaining, I can always try to negotiate a better deal with John if I want to explore alternative options."
