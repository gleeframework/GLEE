Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point because:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving him room to negotiate.
    * It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), giving me some room to compromise. 
* **The message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the deal's value for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to initiate a negotiation process. By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm encouraging him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price within my acceptable range. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or accept John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John guarantees me that amount, which is a much more desirable outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,350,000:** This counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining within my desired range. 
* **The message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm framing the offer as a compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer and offering a counteroffer, I'm showing my commitment to finding a deal while maintaining a strong negotiating position. The counteroffer incentivizes Bob to further negotiate, hopefully leading to a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and potentially wasting time.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of further negotiation lowering the value.
* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time, especially since he's consistently pushing for a lower price.
* **Future Potential:**  I might be able to find another buyer in the future who is willing to pay closer to my desired price.

By selling to John, I secure a reliable outcome and can pursue other opportunities for a higher price in the future."
