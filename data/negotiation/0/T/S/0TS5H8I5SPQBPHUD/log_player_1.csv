Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By aiming for $900,000, I have the chance to earn $100,000 more than selling to John.
* **Risk mitigation:** I still have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so there's no real downside if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob expresses interest but wants a lower price. 

This offer is a calculated risk that balances the potential for higher earnings with the certainty of a guaranteed sale."
