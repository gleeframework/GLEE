Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to what the product is worth to me. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or simply sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my floor price, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my floor price.  It's time to accept and close the deal.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's best to secure the sale and move on."
