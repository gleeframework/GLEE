Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $100 yet. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

```

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. At this point, it's unlikely we'll reach a price close enough to our $80 target.  It's more strategic to cut our losses and buy from John for a guaranteed good deal."
