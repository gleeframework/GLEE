Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175. It's a steal considering its value! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** My message focuses on the value of the product and uses positive language to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $140? I understand if you can't, but it would help me make a decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth.
* **John is a reliable alternative buyer.**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum.  This gives me leverage to push for a better price from Bob. 
* **Counter-offering allows for further negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see you're trying to work within your budget. However, $140 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($140). This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $150 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.
* **John offers the same price.** While I could potentially continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price.
* **Accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient option.** It secures the sale and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
