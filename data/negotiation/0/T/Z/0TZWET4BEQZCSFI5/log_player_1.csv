Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, worth more than a million dollars to me.  I'm confident it's a game-changer for the right buyer. My initial offer is $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds for you. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm open to compromise.  Let's try $1100000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to close the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,150,000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to secure a great product at a competitive price, and me to get closer to my desired target."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  $1150000 is tempting, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1125000.  This would represent a good value for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I want to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  This price is a good compromise and secures a sale that's above my minimum acceptable threshold."
