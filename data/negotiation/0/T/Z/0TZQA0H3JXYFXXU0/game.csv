"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $975,000? I feel that's a fair offer, putting us closer to a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering your offer, I'm willing to reduce the price by another $25,000 and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate that this is your final offer, however, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I could do $1,000,000. This would be my final offer as well. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
