"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $145 is a better price than John's offer, you can save more money by rejecting Alice's offer. This will likely lead her to propose a lower price, potentially getting you closer to your $120 limit."
