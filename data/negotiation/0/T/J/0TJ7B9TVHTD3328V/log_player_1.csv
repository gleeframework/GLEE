Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $13,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is my final offer, if you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
