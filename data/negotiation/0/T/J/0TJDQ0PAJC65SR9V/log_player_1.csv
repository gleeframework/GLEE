Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll increase the price by $25,000, which is still below the original value of $800,000 to Bob. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $750,000 again.
