"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $700,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to close the deal right now at $650,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $675,000, which is a significant concession on my part. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,3,
