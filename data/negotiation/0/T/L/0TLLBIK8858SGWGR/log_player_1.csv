Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $700,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to close the deal right now at $650,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 675000}"
