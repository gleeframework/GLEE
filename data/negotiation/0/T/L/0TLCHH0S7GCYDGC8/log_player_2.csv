I'm offering Alice $11,500. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant discount from her initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation."

I'm going to offer Alice my final price, $12,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's also the price John is offering.  I'm hoping Alice recognizes the value of a quick deal and accepts."
