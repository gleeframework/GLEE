"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that I believe is fair to both of us.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as ""fair,"" it's the highest possible price you'd be willing to pay.  There's no benefit to accepting immediately. By rejecting, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure the sale.
* **Lose nothing:** You can always buy from John at the same price if Alice doesn't budge."
