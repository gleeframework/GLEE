Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive the final price as a ""deal"" even if it's above his initial valuation.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned to Bob, knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, there's space to reduce the price while still securing a profit above John's offer.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't have perfect information about your alternative offer from John."
