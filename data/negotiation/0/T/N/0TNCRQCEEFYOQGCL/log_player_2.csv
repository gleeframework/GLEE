"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
Alice's first offer is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider a price of $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to move on price.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is crucial in negotiations. I acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest, making it clear this is a negotiation tactic, not a rejection.
* **Budget Justification:**  Mentioning a ""tight budget"" adds a layer of justification to my counteroffer without revealing too much about my financial situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice moved from $950,000 to $900,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000. There's a chance we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still an option, but I believe I can get a better price from Alice with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $850,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our last offers ($900,000 and $800,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I want to emphasize that I'm making a significant move to show good faith and encourage Alice to do the same.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned a deadline, I want to keep the negotiation moving towards a close."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my own expectations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $875,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice has signaled that this is her final offer (""as low as I'm willing to go""). Pushing further might risk the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially losing the opportunity."
