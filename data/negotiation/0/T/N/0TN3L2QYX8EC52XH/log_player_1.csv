Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. My maximum willingness to pay is $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob has clearly stated his maximum willingness to pay. Accepting his offer of $12,000 is the most logical choice at this point, as it meets my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
