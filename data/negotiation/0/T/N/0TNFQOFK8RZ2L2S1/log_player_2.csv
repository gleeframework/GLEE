# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think?

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $9,500, as you can get the product from John for $8,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,800 is still a little high for me.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,600. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.
