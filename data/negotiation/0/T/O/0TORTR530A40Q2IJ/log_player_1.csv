Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefit it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't want to scare him away with a price too close to that. Offering it at $10,000 allows us to potentially make a $2,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
