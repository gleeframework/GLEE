"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth to you. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,000,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a win-win situation for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
