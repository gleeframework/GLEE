"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth to you. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,000,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Alice's price is higher than her own valuation, it's still lower than what Bob would pay John.
* **Saving money is the goal:** Bob's goal is to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that by saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
