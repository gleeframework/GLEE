Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach my $800,000 limit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation rounds. John offers a guaranteed price that meets my budget, so it's more efficient to buy from him at this point."
