Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of the product.
