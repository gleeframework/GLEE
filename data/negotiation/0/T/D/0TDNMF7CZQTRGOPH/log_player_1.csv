{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Making it easy for Bob to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed $12,000 from John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired range and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing compromise and value:** This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value to him, making the offer more attractive.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to continue negotiating, allowing for a potential win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **There's room for a higher counteroffer:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired price range.
* **John's offer is a good backup:**  While you'd prefer to get more from Bob, John's offer provides a secure safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to $12,000 and see if you can get Bob to agree to a price that works for both of you."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer right now."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your minimum.
* **Highlighting the win-win:** The message emphasizes that this price would be beneficial for both parties.
* **Final offer implication:** The message suggests that this is your best offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or move closer to your price."
