"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's the best I can offer right now.",11500.0,Alice,5,
