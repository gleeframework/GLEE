"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I've priced at $12,000, which is a fair deal considering its worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than your limit. Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
