Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,900,000."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is above Bob's perceived value. While it's unlikely he'll accept it, it establishes a strong position and signals the product's worth in your eyes. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** The significant gap between the offer and John's standing offer gives you ample space to lower the price during negotiations if Bob shows resistance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer.  While he's indicating a willingness to negotiate, accepting his first offer outright would leave a lot of money on the table. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we consider $1,700,000? This price reflects the asset's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Target:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining well above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price helps to manage Bob's expectations and presents the offer as reasonable rather than arbitrary.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much negotiating room there truly is. Bob's response will be telling about his potential to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I still feel that $1,700,000 is a bit high for me. How about we try $1,400,000? It's closer to what I'm comfortable spending, but still acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price from John ($1,500,000).
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has skillfully negotiated you down, and there's no guarantee he'll move much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the potential for the deal to fall through, leading you to accept John's offer later anyway. 

While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, the certainty of a $1,400,000 sale outweighs the potential upside of a marginally better deal with a higher risk of losing the sale."
