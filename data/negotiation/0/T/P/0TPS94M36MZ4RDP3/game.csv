"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial amount and allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to your target. I'll make a new offer of $980,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $980,000 is getting very close to what I'm able to pay. If you can come down just a little more to $970,000, I'd be happy to close the deal. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",970000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession to meet you at a price that works for both of us. I'll make a new offer of $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",975000.0,Alice,7,
