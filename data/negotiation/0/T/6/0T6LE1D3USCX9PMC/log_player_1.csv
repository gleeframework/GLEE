I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to secure a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,900. Can we consider that a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
