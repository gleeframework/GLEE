"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,900. Can we consider that a fair price for the product?",7900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely honest,  $7,900 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum price point.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I think we're very close to a deal, Alice! I'm willing to meet you at $7,900, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
