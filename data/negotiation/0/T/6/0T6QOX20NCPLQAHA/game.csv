"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it for $14,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and am open to discussing further.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe the product has some great features, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $14,000. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. Its unique features and the value it brings justify a higher price point. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,500 is still below what I consider a fair price.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, and that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
