"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This feels like a fair starting point.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a better deal. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll meet you halfway again, but I'll only go up to $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
