Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a lot closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, as you'd be getting it for less than its value to you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price, especially since I know it's worth significantly more to Bob.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's well above my minimum and still significantly less than the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that you're willing to sell it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not as high as I'd like. I believe I can still get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob, as he clearly values the product highly.  I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $962,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal so we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 962500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'd like a 1% discount for a quick payment. So, the price would be $913,750. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to pay quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $913,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $913,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've negotiated with Bob for several rounds, and while he's willing to pay a decent price, it's still below my desired target.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than John is offering, which is already above my minimum.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
