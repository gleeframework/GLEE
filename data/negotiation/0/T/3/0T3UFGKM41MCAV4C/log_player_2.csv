"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good start, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still rounds left, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.

Let's continue this conversation and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, and while Alice's offer is closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his target.  He should continue negotiating to try and push the price down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to his goal, it's still above his target.  He should continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further before considering buying from John. There are still rounds left, and he's already managed to get the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I recognize we're getting closer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been able to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer. While he'd prefer a lower price, Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer than to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate or buying from John at a higher price. He saves $125,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
