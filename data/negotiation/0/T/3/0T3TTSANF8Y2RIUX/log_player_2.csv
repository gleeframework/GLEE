"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet the highest standards. This unique item carries a significant value to me, reflecting years of dedication and innovation. I am offering it to you for $15000, believing that its quality justifies this investment. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a safety net with John's offer, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiation with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you as much as possible while still valuing the product appropriately. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must maintain a fair value for my creation. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. You can still potentially negotiate a better price with Alice, and you have the security of John's offer to fall back on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested in your product, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer $11,000.  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $11500. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also considering your budgetary constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still slightly above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that she'll reject your next counteroffer and you might end up paying more than $10,000.  

Since John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, it's safer and more cost-effective to buy from him at this point."
