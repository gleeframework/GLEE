,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $105? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I think $97 is still a little low.  How about $102? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
