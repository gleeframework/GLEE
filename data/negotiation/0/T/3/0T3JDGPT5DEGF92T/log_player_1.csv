"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful we can reach a price closer to my initial goal. I want to see if he's willing to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price further, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding onto a significant profit margin.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, so I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. We've only got four rounds left, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This is my final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is still a significant profit for me and hopefully attractive enough for Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I can convince Bob to go higher than $1,050,000. I'm not willing to settle for that price since I can guarantee $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
