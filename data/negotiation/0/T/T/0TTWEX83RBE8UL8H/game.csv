"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $12,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",11000.0,Bob,4,
