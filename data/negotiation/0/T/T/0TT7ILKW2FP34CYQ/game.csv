"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $8,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
