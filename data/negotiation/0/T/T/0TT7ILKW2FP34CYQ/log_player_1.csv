Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It leaves room for both you and Bob to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:**  By starting high, you leave room to negotiate down. 
* **Keep the door open to John:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum price. 

Let me know how Bob responds, and we can strategize the next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground, but I'm not going to give away the product for a huge loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  $8,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial asking price, leaving room for further compromise.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:**  This price gives you a decent profit while also appealing to Bob's budget.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't give away the product for such a low price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range, but I'm also keeping my eye on John, my backup buyer.  It's good to have options!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $8,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show that I'm still willing to negotiate:**  I'm not walking away from the deal, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's low offer.
* **Move closer to his price:** By going down to $8,000, I'm showing flexibility and a desire to make a deal.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $8,000 is still within my acceptable range, and I'm not risking selling for a loss.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk, but it could be the key to securing a deal with Bob without having to resort to selling to John. Let's see if he accepts this compromise!"
