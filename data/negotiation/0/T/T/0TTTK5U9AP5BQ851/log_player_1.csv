"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer allows you to assess how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how flexible he might be in his counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. You'll be negotiating with Bob while being aware of your fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting a price of $1,600,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You haven't drastically reduced your price, indicating you're firm on the product's value. 
* **Encouraging a Response:** This counteroffer prompts Bob to reconsider and potentially counter with a higher number, moving the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but no higher. Can we compromise on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a substantial profit over both your minimum and John's offer. While there might be a slight chance of squeezing out a bit more in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns of further negotiation make this a good point to accept."
