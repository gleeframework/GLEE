"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm really only looking to spend $8,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $8,500? It's still a good price for you, and closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is only willing to go down to $8,500, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is Bob's target price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when Bob can get a better deal elsewhere."
