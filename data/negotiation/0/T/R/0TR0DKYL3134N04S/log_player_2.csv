"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $950,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who recognizes the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. Let's start with $850,000.  I'm serious about buying this, and I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to get a better deal.  There are still rounds remaining to potentially get a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5% discount on the price of a related service. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer, despite adding a small bonus. Bob is still aiming for a lower price and should continue to try and negotiate.  There are still rounds left, and  it's worth exploring if Alice will budge further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my target price. I'll make one more concession and offer the product to you for $975,000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty and support package worth $25,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his comfort zone.  With only three rounds left, and a limited chance of further negotiation, it's more strategic for Bob to purchase the product from John at $1,000,000. This guarantees a purchase within his budget and avoids further haggling.  While he's not getting the absolute best deal, it ensures a quick and definitive transaction."
