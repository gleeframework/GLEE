"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  Since I can always sell to John for $100, I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $100. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm still willing to sell to John, but I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still above my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit. If he rejects this offer, I'm going to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident that I can get my minimum of $100 by selling to John. It's not worth risking another round of negotiations with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John."
