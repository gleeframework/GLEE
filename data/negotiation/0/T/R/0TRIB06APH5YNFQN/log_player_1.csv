Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit. I know I can get at least $1,000,000 from John, so I want to try for more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering $1,500,000 is a gamble. If Bob values the product less, he'll reject it, and I'll get my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. But if Bob values it higher, I could earn a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm aiming for a price that's attractive but not too high. This increases the chance Bob will accept, while still giving me a decent markup."
