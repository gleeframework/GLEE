{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking $130 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, giving me room to negotiate. I also signal that I'm open to discussion to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good compromise.  It's better to secure a sale at $110 than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $120."
