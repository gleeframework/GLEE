"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's within your budget, it's still significantly more than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices through counteroffers.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can always buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage during the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  A $150,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant step, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, it's likely she wants a price closer to $1,400,000. 
* **Staying within your budget:** This offer keeps you well below your maximum budget of $1,500,000."

* **Counteroffers are working:**  Alice's counteroffer indicates she's willing to compromise. This suggests continuing negotiations could yield a better price.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** You're not under any pressure to accept Alice's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. It shows you're serious about making a deal but are still trying to get the best price. 
* **Testing the limit:**  If Alice accepts, you've secured a good deal. If she rejects, it's a signal that she's looking for a price closer to $1,400,000.
* **Staying within your budget:** You still have room to increase your offer if necessary, but this keeps you well within your maximum budget."
