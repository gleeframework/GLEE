"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know how valuable it would be for you, so I'm starting the negotiations at $1,100,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice to start negotiations slightly higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's willingness to pay. If he accepts right away, we know we could have gone higher. If he rejects, his counteroffer will give us more information about his budget limitations.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, so we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than our initial ask and still leaves a lot of room for negotiation. 
* We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he has the budget to go higher.
* By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're aiming for a better deal and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price while acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to respond with his revised expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are unlikely to outweigh the risks of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to re-invest the proceeds sooner, potentially generating additional returns."
