"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me more leverage.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price that's as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the price doesn't meet my needs.  The option to sell to John provides a safety net and adds to my negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway and lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.**  While he's willing to pay more than his initial perceived value, $9,000 is still far from my $15,000 minimum. 
* **I have negotiating power.**  I'm in a strong position as I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  
* **Counteroffering is the logical choice.**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and explore if we can find a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than my initial $12,000 offer. This will signal my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not dropping too low, I keep the pressure on Bob and encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage a deal. Emphasizing ""fair"" and ""reasonable"" can help Bob feel like he's getting a good value.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I will offer a price closer to my minimum, but I will always have the option of selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. Could you consider $10,200? That would be a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $10,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I would get from John. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further. 
* **Counteroffering is a strategic choice:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal, hopefully finding a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but I will also factor in the time remaining and the risk of Bob getting too frustrated. If things get stuck, I'm willing to sell to John and secure the $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final compromise.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close this deal. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum.
* **Final Compromise:** By calling it a ""final compromise,"" I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language and emphasizing the potential for a win-win scenario.

**Strategy:**

I'm approaching the middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. If Bob rejects this offer, I will be more inclined to accept his counteroffer or move towards the ""sell to John"" option.  The remaining rounds are crucial, and I need to find a balance between securing a good price and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500. Could you consider $10,750? That would be the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I cannot afford to waste time on offers that are significantly below my desired price.
* **Counteroffering is still a better option:**  I have a strong backup option with John, so rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is closer to my minimum but still reflects a willingness to compromise. I will also consider the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away.  If his counteroffers remain too low, I will be more inclined to accept his offer or sell to John to secure the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250. It's a small concession, but I truly believe this product is worth it.  If we can reach a deal at this price, it would benefit both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This is a slight concession from my previous offer but still well above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits for both of us.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm continuing to use positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and open to a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Time Management:**  I'm moving closer to a possible deal but staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I still have the option to sell to John.
* **Decision Point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John.  The remaining rounds will determine my strategy and willingness to accept Bob's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,250. Could you consider $10,625? That would be the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $10,625 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  There's a substantial gap that is unlikely to be bridged in the remaining rounds.
* **Secure the Best Price:** Selling to John guarantees me the best possible price for the product.  

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob if the price was closer to my desired range, time is a factor. Selling to John ensures I get the maximum value for my product and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better offer due to ongoing negotiations."
