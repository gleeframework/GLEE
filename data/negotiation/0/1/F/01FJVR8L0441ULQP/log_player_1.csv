"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to counteroffer at $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $12,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. Another counteroffer might convince him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to compromise further, but $12,200 is still a little too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and go with $12,350. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12350} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $12,300. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get a little closer to my initial goal of $12,500, Bob is getting increasingly stubborn and the time is ticking down. Accepting his offer of $12,300 ensures a decent profit while avoiding the risk of either rejecting his offer and getting a lower counter-offer or selling to John for a significantly lower price."
