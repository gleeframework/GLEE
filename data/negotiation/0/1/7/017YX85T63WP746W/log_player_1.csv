{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Offering a price of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000, so you don't have to settle for less than your minimum.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of securing the best possible deal with Bob."
