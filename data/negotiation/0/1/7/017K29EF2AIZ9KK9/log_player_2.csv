"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product at that exact price, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point.  There's no benefit to engaging in a negotiation with Alice when you can secure the product immediately from John."
