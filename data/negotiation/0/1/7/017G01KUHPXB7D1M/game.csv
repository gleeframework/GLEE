"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $600,000 mark to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds significant value for you, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer you $750,000. I think that's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and I hope it's a fair compromise we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I'm confident my product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize this deal today.",900000.0,Alice,7,
