Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $600,000 mark to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds significant value for you, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer you $750,000. I think that's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $800,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer.

While $800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
