"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90.  I believe it's worth much more, but I'm offering you this special price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can reject Alice's offer because we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. There is a chance Alice might offer a lower price in further negotiation, allowing us to save more."
