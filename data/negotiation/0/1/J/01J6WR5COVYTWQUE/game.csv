"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we possibly meet somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference and call it $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $775,000. I can do $825,000, which is a bit closer to my target, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
