"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",10200.0,Alice,5,
