"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but let's split the difference. How about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
