"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Addressing Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob clearly sees value in the product (willing to pay more than my minimum). By rejecting his offer, I can encourage further negotiation and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Value of Time:**  With 10 rounds, I have time to see if Bob will increase his offer further.

**Next Round:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my ideal selling point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $95? I think this would still be a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm increasing the price slightly, but not drastically, to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential deal for Bob, reminding him that even at $95, the product is worth more to him.
* **Maintain Negotiation:** By continuing the negotiation, I'm keeping the pressure on Bob to potentially offer a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I'd like to counter with $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price.  Accepting this offer means I'll secure a profit significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  If I reject his offer, there's no guarantee he'll offer more, and I could end up with less than $92.
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and time is ticking. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal now, rather than potentially risking a lower price later."
