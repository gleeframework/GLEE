"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired selling price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice. 
* **Further negotiation is possible.** By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal. 
* **Buying from John is not yet necessary.** While buying from John is always an option,  it's not the most financially savvy choice at this point."
