Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially offering it to you at $1,300,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, we don't want to limit ourselves. Starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  A brief explanation about the product's value helps justify the high price and might pique Bob's interest even if it's above his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies you're open to discussing the price, giving Bob the chance to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable figure.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and willingness to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need to sell the product quickly, a more aggressive starting price closer to $1,500,000 might be necessary."
