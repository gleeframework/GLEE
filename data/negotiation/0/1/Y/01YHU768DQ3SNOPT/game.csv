"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  What do you think about that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  Would you consider $710,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you there. I'm willing to go down to $715,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,
