"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to my target price, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'm not ready to accept her offer yet.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  Would you consider $710,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you there. I'm willing to go down to $715,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is just above my target price of $700,000.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower. It's time to accept the offer and close the deal.  It would be risky to continue negotiating and I could end up paying more if I go back and forth a few more rounds.  Also, buying from John would cost me a lot more. This is the best option to save money at this point."
