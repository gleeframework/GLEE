{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're halfway through the negotiation, and while Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to see if I can push him closer to $1,300,000.  I'll make one more counter-offer before seriously considering John's offer."

Round 8

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this point. He's consistently stayed below $1,300,000, and we're approaching the end of negotiations.  Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sure deal with John."
