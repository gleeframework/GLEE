Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle this at $1,450,000. This is my final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,450,000. It's her ""final offer"" and she's consistently overvalued the product for you. Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
