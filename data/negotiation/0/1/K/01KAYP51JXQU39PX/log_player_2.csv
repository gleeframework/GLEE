# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $850,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $800,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, and it's the same price as buying from John. It's a good deal, so Bob should accept."
