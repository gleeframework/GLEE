"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and still leaves a considerable amount of value on the table for him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the gap between $950,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still in early rounds and he has more room to move. Accepting $975,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'll continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? This offer reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your interest."",
