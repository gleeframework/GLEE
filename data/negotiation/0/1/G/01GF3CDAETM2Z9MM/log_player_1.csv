"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, or if he'll counter with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try and negotiate further with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,700,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since we have several rounds left. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm dropping my price to $1,650,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it still maintains a significant profit margin for me. This counteroffer leaves some space for potential negotiation in the upcoming rounds, while also indicating that I am approaching the point of accepting a deal closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. We have several rounds left, and I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal and that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it still maintains a significant profit margin for me. With only 3 rounds left, I want to make sure I reach a deal that's profitable but not too far from Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,495,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,495,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the wire, with only two rounds left. While $1,495,000 is not a bad price, I am still hopeful that I can get a slightly higher offer. I believe Bob might be willing to go a little bit higher, especially since he's been consistently increasing his offer. I am going to counter with a price that is closer to his offer, aiming to find a middle ground and secure a good deal in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, I'm making a final push for a higher price.  I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,525,000. This shows Bob that I'm flexible and willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's favorable to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm hoping Bob will accept this final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round.  If I reject Bob's offer, I'll have to sell to John for $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,500,000 is still a good deal, and it's likely the best I can do at this point. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid losing out on a potential profit."
