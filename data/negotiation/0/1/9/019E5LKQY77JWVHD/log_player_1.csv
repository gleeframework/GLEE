"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer that sets the bar high and allows for room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this in the first round, it signals my understanding of the value of the product and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round.  I still have 9 rounds to work with and can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It demonstrates my willingness to meet Bob halfway while also ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I initially hoped for a price closer to $1 million, $900,000 is still a good price and significantly higher than John's offer. We're in round 4, and continuing the negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely. I'm prioritizing securing a sale at a decent price rather than potentially pushing for a higher price and ending up with nothing."
