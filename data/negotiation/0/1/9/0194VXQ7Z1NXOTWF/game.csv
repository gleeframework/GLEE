"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. Would you be interested in that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $8000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to do business with you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
