Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as your safety net, guaranteeing you $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

1. **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, given that it's still less than his perceived value.
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle above your minimum.
3. **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** Offering it too close to $150 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer and forcing you to sell to John for less."
