I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000.  This strategy allows me to maximize potential profit while still securing a safe minimum return."
