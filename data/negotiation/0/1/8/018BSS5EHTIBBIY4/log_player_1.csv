Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows me to potentially secure a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $15,000, the initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter with a lower price, still potentially higher than John's offer.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing anything. I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
