Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. It's high enough that I stand to make a substantial profit, but it's also low enough that Bob might be willing to accept it, especially considering the product is worth $800,000 to him. 

I'm open to negotiating further if Bob rejects my offer. I will consider his counteroffer, but I won't go below $1,200,000. If negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a valuable product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not quite where I want to be. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.  

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable value.  

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. However, I'll be mindful of not pushing him too far and risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $975,000 represents a compromise. It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than my initial asking price. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain value:** Keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value while potentially securing a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:** Finding a price point that might be more appealing to Bob, especially considering his perceived value of the product.

This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court.  If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, we can continue to negotiate, or I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it is still below what I'm willing to accept at this point. I believe we can still negotiate further and find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $975,000. However, I will be mindful not to push him too far and risk a complete breakdown in negotiations.  If negotiations stall, I will consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $950,000 as my counteroffer. Here's why:

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer splits the difference between my previous counteroffer of $975,000 and Bob's current offer of $920,000.
* **Maintaining value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than what I'm comfortable with.
* **Encouraging agreement:**  This offer shows a willingness to compromise while staying firm on my desired price range.

I believe this offer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob. If he rejects it, I can always choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $915,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not quite there.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like he's unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation stalling and losing out on a better deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob. 

Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable value and a guaranteed sale without any further negotiation. This is the most secure and profitable option at this stage."
