"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $500,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $500,000, Alice.  How about we settle at $650,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $650,000. I'm still a bit above that, so I'm willing to offer you a revised price of $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  What if we split the difference and settled at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,7,
