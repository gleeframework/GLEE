{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I am starting high, knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob, but I believe I can get closer to my minimum of $150 through negotiation. I also want to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal by offering a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
