"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This approach balances maximizing profit with increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $150 for the product. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely. While I could try to counter-offer, there's no guarantee of a better outcome, and I risk losing the sale altogether."
