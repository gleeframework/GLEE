"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, and $950000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $970000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $990000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $990000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $985000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",985000.0,Alice,9,
