"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm initially offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $16,000?  That would be a more reasonable compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $9,500? That's a significant jump on my end.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While I'm aiming higher, I could be persuaded to let it go for $13,000. This offer is time sensitive though, as I have other interested parties.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your time.  I understand you have other potential buyers, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $10,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
