"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. Considering your offer of $900,000, I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we settle at $975,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,025,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a compromise that I think is still fair considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
