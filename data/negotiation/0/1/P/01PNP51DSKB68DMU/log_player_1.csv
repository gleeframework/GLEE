Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's high enough to leave room for negotiation, but low enough that Bob might be willing to accept it. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, he still gets a good deal, and I get close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, while also being closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and represents a decent profit. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or having to sell to John for a lower price."
