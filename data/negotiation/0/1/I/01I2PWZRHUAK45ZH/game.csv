"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility in your price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1800000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000. Can you really make this work for $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
