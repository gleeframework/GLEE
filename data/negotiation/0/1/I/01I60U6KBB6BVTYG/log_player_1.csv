Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows for some potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and I can still potentially settle for a price above my minimum ($150).
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you value a quick sale, you might choose a different starting price."
