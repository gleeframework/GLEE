"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my own assessment of its value. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you a price of $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going above $800000. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be cautious with your budget, but I'm starting to think that you're not valuing the product as much as I do. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
