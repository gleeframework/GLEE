"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in closing the deal, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I have rounds to negotiate and  I want to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being within a reasonable range for you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect its true value.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This price is more in line with the product's true value and offers you a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, $1,075,000 is still not a satisfactory price for me. There are still more rounds to negotiate and I believe we can find a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. Given that this is getting close to the end of our negotiation,  I'm willing to offer a final compromise. Let's go with $1,150,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.  It's time to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but no higher. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still being below my minimum threshold, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a better deal than what Bob is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
