"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand your perspective on its value to you.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price better reflects the true value and potential of the product.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This offer takes into account the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I recognize your upper limit may be closer to your offer, but I can't part with this product for less than $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,
