Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.
