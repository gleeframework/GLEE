"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $10000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $9000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $9500 for the product? This is higher than your offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming for a fair deal for both parties.",9500.0,Alice,3,
