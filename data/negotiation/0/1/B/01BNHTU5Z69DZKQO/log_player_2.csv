"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $10000. This is an exceptional opportunity given the value this product holds for you, which is $12000. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $9500 for the product? This is higher than your offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming for a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's still below Bob's maximum price of $12,000 and closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,000.  Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
