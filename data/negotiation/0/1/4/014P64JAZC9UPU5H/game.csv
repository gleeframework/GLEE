"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my offer of $9000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10500. It's a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
