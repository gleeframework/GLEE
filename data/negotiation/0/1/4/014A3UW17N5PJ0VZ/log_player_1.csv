Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to discuss a fair price to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially offer a counter-proposal.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll decide whether to:

* **Accept a Counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum price, I'll likely accept to close the deal.
* **Make a Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum price, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to gradually come down to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's offers keep getting too low, I'll sell the product to John to ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm willing to risk further negotiation to potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I might propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll be getting. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by dropping the price to $8,500. This demonstrates my interest in reaching a deal while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing that the offer is ""a significant reduction"" to make the price more attractive.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response and decide whether to:

* **Accept a Counteroffer:** If Bob counters with an offer close to $8,500, I'll likely accept. 
* **Make Another Counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll make another counteroffer, potentially dropping the price slightly further, but aiming to stay above $8,000.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's offers continue to be unreasonable, I'll sell the product to John to secure the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While there's a chance we could continue to negotiate, it's highly unlikely that Bob will increase his offer to a level I'm comfortable with. It's getting risky to keep negotiating, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $8,000 from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John to secure the guaranteed $8,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's more important to ensure I get a fair return on the product."
