"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While the product does seem promising, I'm not comfortable with the price. My current budget allows for a maximum of $1000000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1000000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
