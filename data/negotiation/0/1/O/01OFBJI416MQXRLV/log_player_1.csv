Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation to entice him. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, giving her leverage.

By starting at $14,500, Alice leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. This strategy gives Alice the best chance to maximize her profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
