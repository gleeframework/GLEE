"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $12,000.  That's a significant markup.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I believe the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob shouldn't settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high for Bob, who has a maximum budget of $8,000. Given that Bob has access to John who is willing to sell the product for his maximum price, it's more efficient to go with John at this point.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge any further, and Bob could risk wasting more time on the negotiation."
