"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I believe the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows us both to get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to sell it to you at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
