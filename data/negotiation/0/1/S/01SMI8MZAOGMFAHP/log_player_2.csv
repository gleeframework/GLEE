"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $8,000 limit as possible.  He's starting with a counteroffer of $8,500, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  This shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal, but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still too high for Bob, and there's no guarantee she'll come down further.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, so there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice."
