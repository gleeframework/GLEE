"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given my maximum budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the potential of this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable potential, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the value while still acknowledging your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is still higher than my ideal price point, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This demonstrates my commitment to this deal, and I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $900,000 remains beneath the product's true value and what I'm comfortable accepting. My final offer is $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  ",975000.0,Alice,5,
