"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate from a strong position, implying she has other buyers. While her offer isn't astronomically high, it's still above your maximum and leaves little room for you to save. Rejecting might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can always fall back on John's offer."
