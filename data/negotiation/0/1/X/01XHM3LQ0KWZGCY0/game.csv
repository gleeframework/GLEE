,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This reflects both the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant concession. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.  Time is of the essence.",10000.0,Alice,5,
