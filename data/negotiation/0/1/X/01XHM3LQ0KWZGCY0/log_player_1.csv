"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him.

This strategy aims to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to negotiate without immediately pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, as he acknowledged the product's value.
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's a chance I can get a better deal with Bob.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This reflects both the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use positive language to maintain a friendly and collaborative negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach an agreement.  I'm still willing to negotiate further if needed, but I'm not willing to drop much lower than $10,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I believe we can reach an agreement at this point. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob is sticking to his $9,000 offer, despite my attempts to compromise. This suggests he's unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm still far from my desired price.
* **Risk of John:** While I'd prefer to get a better deal with Bob, the risk of losing the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly real.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again to see if I can push him a little further, but I'm also seriously considering selling to John if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant concession. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.  Time is of the essence."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm making a final offer with a clear ultimatum. 
* **Stronger Position:**  By emphasizing that I'm willing to explore other options, I'm subtly suggesting I'm ready to sell to John. This strengthens my negotiating position.
* **Urgency:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning the limited time. This encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

I'm hoping this final offer will convince Bob to come up to my price, but I'm prepared to walk away if he refuses. The risk of losing out on the $15,000 sale to John is too high at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I believe we can reach an agreement at this point. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate with Bob.  He's not willing to move from his $9,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of losing out to John is becoming too significant.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, and it's much closer to my desired price.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a better agreement with Bob, it's in my best interest to take John's offer and secure the sale. I've reached my limit with Bob, and continuing to negotiate risks losing both deals."
