"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $110. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price considering the product's worth.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a significant way off from what I need to get for this product. To be honest, I have another potential buyer who's interested at a higher price.  I'd rather work something out with you, but I need you to be closer to my original offer. Would you consider $98?",98.0,Alice,5,
