I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $1,200,000, so I'm not immediately accepting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $25,000 less than my desired amount and is significantly higher than John's offer. It's a good compromise and a reasonable price."
