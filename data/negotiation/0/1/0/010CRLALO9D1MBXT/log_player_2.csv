"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, Bob knows:

* The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, meaning there might be room for negotiation. 
* Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, giving him some bargaining power.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can see if Alice will come down closer to her product's value.  Worst case, he can still buy from John for $15,000."
