"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Let me start by suggesting a price of $95 for the product. I look forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground. How about we agree on a price of $90 for the product? This is still a fair price considering its value to you, while also allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $89 for the product. It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still below its perceived value to you. I hope this helps us reach a satisfactory agreement.",89.0,Alice,5,
