"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget for this product is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I can't go lower than $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial asking price, but her latest offer is still $1,000 higher than Bob's budget.  While negotiating further might be possible,  Bob has already been through two rounds of offers and counteroffers.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the time and effort involved. Bob can get the product for his desired price from John, making it the most efficient option."
