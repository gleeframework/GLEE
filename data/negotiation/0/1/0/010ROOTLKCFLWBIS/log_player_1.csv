While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This price still nets a $50,000 profit over selling to John. 
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob's increases are getting smaller, suggesting he's nearing his maximum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging on the negotiation risks Bob walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer."
