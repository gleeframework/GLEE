"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $1,150,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.
*  Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not guaranteed. Accepting her offer secures a lower price than John's and minimizes risk."
