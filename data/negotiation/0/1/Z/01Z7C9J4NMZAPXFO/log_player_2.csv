"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our price limit. This keeps the conversation amicable and encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic Aim:** Our goal is to get the product for a price close to our maximum budget ($100).  By starting low, we hope to meet somewhere in the middle. We always have the option to go up if needed, or buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign. However, $115 is still above our budget and our fallback option (buying from John). We want to push for a better deal.  We'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $115 is closer, I'm working with a tight budget. Could you do $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are moving closer to Alice's price but in smaller increments. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while sticking to our budget.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning our ""tight budget"" reinforces the idea that we have a firm limit and encourages Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $95 puts us very close to our maximum budget and might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, especially since she's already lowered her price significantly."
