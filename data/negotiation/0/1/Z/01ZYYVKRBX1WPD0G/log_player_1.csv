{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept. 
* **Knowing the Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives us a significant profit margin over Bob's valuation while still leaving room for potential negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob without revealing our bottom line. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We can always negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but starting high gives us the best chance to maximize our earnings."
