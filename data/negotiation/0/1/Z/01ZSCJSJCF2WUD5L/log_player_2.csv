"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit (she values it at $80). By rejecting this offer, you might be able to:

* Get Alice to lower her price in a counter-offer. 
* Avoid showing you're overly eager.

You always have the safety net of buying from John for $150."
