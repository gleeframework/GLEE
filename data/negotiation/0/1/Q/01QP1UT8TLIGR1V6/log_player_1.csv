Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly valuable to you, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's always beneficial to try and secure a higher price first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 presents a significant discount to Bob (saving him $2,000) while still generating a $1,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  The message doesn't explicitly mention John, but it implies there might be other interested parties, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
**This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with a reasonable likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.**"
