Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer.  
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high might discourage Bob completely. This price offers a perceived discount while still netting a significant profit. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since the product's value to Bob ($100) is close to my minimum acceptable price ($120), there's a good chance he'll find this offer appealing."
