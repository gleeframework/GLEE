"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500**.  This is a good deal, but you can still do better.
* **John's offer is $10,000**. This is your fallback option if you reject Alice's offer.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can still get a better deal by rejecting and potentially negotiating with John. 

**Next Steps:**

* You should reject Alice's offer. 
* You should then contact John and attempt to negotiate a lower price. Your goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible."
