"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed.  I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest level based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I am confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer. However, I'm also aware that I have limited rounds left and John is always a viable option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
