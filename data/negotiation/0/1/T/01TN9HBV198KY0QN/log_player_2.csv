# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
