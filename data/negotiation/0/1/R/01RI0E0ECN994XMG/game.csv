"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget and the value it represents to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $650,000?  That represents a significant compromise for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
