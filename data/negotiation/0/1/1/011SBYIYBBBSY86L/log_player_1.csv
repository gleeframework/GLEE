{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get close to my minimum of $150, and if not, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$140 is still below my minimum price, but I'm getting closer.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more than that.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's clear we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  John is offering me my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
