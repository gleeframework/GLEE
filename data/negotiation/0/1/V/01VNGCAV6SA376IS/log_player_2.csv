"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $140 to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $130?

Alice is coming down, but slowly. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $120."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make it worth my while. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is very close to her value for the product, and continuing to negotiate might make her unwilling to deal.  Accepting at $125 gets a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $150."
