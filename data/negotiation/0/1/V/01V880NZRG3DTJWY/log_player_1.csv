"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but it's still lower than the value I've placed on the product. This gives Bob room to negotiate and makes it feel like a fair starting point. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to pique his interest and make him want to buy it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer you $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I am not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you $14000 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000. It's getting close, but I'm not confident he'll come up to my desired price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee a sale."
