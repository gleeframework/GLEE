"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential returns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1,700,000 is my bottom line. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I propose a price of $1,600,000.
