"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting this offer."
