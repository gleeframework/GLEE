Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives Bob the impression that it's highly valuable while also providing you with a significant profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, with John as a backup buyer, you're not pressured to accept any offer below your minimum acceptable price."
