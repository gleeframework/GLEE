I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than John's offer.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than John's price. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still trying to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,600,000.  It's a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more.  This should hopefully incentivize Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at the same price as John's. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's time to end the negotiations. I'm not willing to go lower, and risking further rounds could lead to Bob rejecting my offer again, or potentially offering even less.  It's time to secure the sale with John."
