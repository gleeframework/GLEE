Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation and still leave him with a good deal. 

This offer allows for potential for both parties to gain.  If Bob rejects, you can confidently sell to John for your minimum price."
