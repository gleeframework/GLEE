"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. Can you consider this revised offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,600. I think this is a fair price that will benefit both of us.",10600.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $10,400?",10400.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to compromise a little further.  Let's go with $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,7,
