,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be extremely valuable, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
