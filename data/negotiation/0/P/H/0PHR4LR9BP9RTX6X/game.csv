"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point.",975000.0,Alice,5,
