"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have a guaranteed alternative."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still give you a good value, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is better than her original offer, it's still higher than what John is offering. You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, and I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $9500 is still too low for me.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10000. This leaves us both with a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this purchase. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than what John is offering.  It's possible that Alice might come down further, but at this point, you've gone through several rounds of negotiation and you have a guaranteed price from John. You're better off not risking further negotiation and securing the product from John at $8,000."
