"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still give you a good value, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $9500 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, and I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $9500 is still too low for me.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10000. This leaves us both with a good deal, and I'm confident we can finalize this purchase. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
