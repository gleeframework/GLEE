"Alice, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
