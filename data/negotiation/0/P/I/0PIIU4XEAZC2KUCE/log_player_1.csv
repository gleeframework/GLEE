Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to profit ($50,000) while securing a substantial profit ($150,000) for you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Bob is a tough negotiator, he might try to lowball you. Be prepared to counter-offer or walk away, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup offer, maintaining a good relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run.
