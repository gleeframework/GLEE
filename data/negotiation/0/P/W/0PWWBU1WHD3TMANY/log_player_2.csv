Given its high quality and functionality, it's worth $12,000 to you. Considering its exceptional value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $11,000. This represents a great opportunity to secure an asset that could potentially increase your profits and streamline your processes. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $11,000. While this is a good deal, Bob can still get the product for $12,000 from John. Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save an extra $1,000."
