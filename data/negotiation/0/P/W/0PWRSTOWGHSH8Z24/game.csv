"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and hopefully still fit within your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the flexibility in your pricing. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $10,500? This would allow us both to be satisfied with the transaction.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the transaction.",11250.0,Alice,5,
