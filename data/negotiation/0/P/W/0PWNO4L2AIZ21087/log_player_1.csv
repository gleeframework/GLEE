Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that is essential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately bargain with Bob. 

This strategy aims for a price that's appealing to Bob (saving him $5) while still netting me a significant profit."
