"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to exceed your expectations. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, but I am confident it would be an invaluable addition to your collection or business. Considering its worth to you, I propose a special offer of $12,500 for this product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity for us to collaborate on a mutually beneficial transaction. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and more than the product's worth to her ($10,000). This makes it a good deal for both parties. Accepting the offer allows you to save $2,500 compared to buying from John."
