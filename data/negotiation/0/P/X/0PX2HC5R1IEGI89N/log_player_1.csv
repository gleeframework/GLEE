"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $150 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I believe $100 would be a fair price for me to purchase this item. Could you please reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his $100 offer.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. We still have rounds to negotiate, and it's worth trying to nudge him up slightly from his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position.  Let's make this easy â€“ I can do $110 and that's my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I still believe $100 would be a fair price for this product. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge from $100. Holding out for more risks losing both Bob and John's offers. It's better to take the sure $100 now than risk getting nothing."
