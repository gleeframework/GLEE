"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $700,000 is simply not enough. How about $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low. To show you my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's unique value while giving you a good deal.

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show you my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Alice,7,
