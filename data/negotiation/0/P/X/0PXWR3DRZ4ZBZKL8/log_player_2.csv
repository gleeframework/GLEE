"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it, but I'm confident that you'll find its value far exceeds that price.  I understand this is a significant investment, so I encourage you to ask any questions you may have. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'm hoping you'll see the potential in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
