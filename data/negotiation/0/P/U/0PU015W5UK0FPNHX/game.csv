"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I believe the true value of this product warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1350000 is the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1300000. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy. Consider this my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
