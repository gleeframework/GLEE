Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects its exceptional qualities and the potential it holds. I'm confident it's a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I believe the true value of this product warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1350000 is the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. While Bob's offer is enticing, I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy. Consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need to see some more movement on your end. Can you consider $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've reached a stalemate, and Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and ending up with less than $1,000,000 if I reject.  I'll accept the $1,250,000 and secure the sale."
