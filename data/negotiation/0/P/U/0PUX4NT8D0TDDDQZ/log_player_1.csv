Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price point:** This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  Starting with a friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 

By offering a price slightly above your minimum, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and be prepared to make a new one. And, as a backup, I have John who will buy the product for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's shown interest and is willing to pay more than my backup offer from John.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $90, which is the midpoint between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.  
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum and still better than selling to John for $80. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good return."
