"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to earn a decent profit, and I'm confident the product's value to you justifies this price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go lower than this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. Can we call it a deal at that price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $980,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.  What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $990,000. I'm willing to pay $985,000. Can we meet in the middle?",985000.0,Bob,8,
