You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice will lower her price further if you reject her initial offer.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better deal before resorting to John."
