Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I can afford to start high with Bob.  Offering the product at $150 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always lower the price or eventually accept John's offer as my fallback."
