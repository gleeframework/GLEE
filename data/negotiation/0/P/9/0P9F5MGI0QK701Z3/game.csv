"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to go above $1,150,000 for the product. This is the highest I can afford while still making a reasonable profit. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
