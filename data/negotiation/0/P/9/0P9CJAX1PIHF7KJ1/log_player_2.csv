Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to get closer to my desired value while hopefully remaining within your budget.  Let's keep the negotiation open and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product. It seems we're getting closer to a deal. While I value your time and willingness to negotiate, $950,000 just doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $975,000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while allowing me to secure a fair value for the product.  This is my last offer, so let's see if we can find a solution together.
