"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic value considering its worth to you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value the product holds for Bob,  which might incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher value. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This price reflects the value of the product to you while giving me a fair return."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about we settle on $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$925,000 is a good price, close to my target, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000."
