"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,500?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $8,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,4,
