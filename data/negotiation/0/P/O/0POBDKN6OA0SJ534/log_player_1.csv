I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still allowing room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a profit.  I hope this price is acceptable to Bob, as it's likely the closest we'll get to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired profit margin.  Further negotiation might take more time, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
