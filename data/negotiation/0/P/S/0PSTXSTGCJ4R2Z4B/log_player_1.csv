Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value this product represents to me personally is quite high. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a price I'd consider, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $1,500,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure thing."
