"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I hoped, it's still significantly more than my minimum.
