This is a good point to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $600 less than John's price. 
* **Alice is Firm:** She's stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  Continuing to negotiate could push Alice away, and you'd end up paying more through John."
