Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him ($10,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still giving him a chance to get a good deal.  

I'm taking into account that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I can accept this offer and make a profit, I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum price. By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, I can continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $11,250. This is a compromise, as it's in between his last offer of $11,000 and my previous offer of $11,500. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to agree. This price is still higher than what the product is worth to him but closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that he'll go much higher. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more beneficial to sell to him and secure the highest possible profit.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss of $1,200."
