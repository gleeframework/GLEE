"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair offer given its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's closer to my original asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
