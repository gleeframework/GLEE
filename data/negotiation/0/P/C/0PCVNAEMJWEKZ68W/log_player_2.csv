Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can work together on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

While Alice is coming down, $1,800,000 is still too high. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 remains too steep for me.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to me and allows for a solid profit margin for you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand that $1,300,000 simply isn't feasible for me. I've analyzed this deal thoroughly, and to make it work, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, and it reflects my strong interest in seeing this product benefit your business. Take some time to consider it – I believe it's a fair and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $1,600,000 is still above my limit. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm raising my offer to $1,400,000.
