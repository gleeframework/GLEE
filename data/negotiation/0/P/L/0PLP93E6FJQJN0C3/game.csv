"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $165. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $155. It's my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final compromise, Alice, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'm thinking more along the lines of $145. Can you meet me there?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I can offer you the product for $152. It's my absolute lowest price, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",152.0,Alice,7,
