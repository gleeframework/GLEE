Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a good profit for me.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $100 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer and forcing me to sell to John for $80."
