I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $130 is still too low for me, as I know the product is worth more to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $130 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $128 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. While I appreciate you're trying to get the best price, $128 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $132, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 132}
