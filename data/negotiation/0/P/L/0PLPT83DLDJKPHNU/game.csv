"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
