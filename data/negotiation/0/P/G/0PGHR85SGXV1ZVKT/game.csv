"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm hoping we can settle on $900,000.  That price is still fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $890,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
