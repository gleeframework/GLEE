Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and you can potentially get a better price from Bob or John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiations and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000?  This price acknowledges the value of the product while still being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price further is too great. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and minimizes the risk of a losing proposition."
