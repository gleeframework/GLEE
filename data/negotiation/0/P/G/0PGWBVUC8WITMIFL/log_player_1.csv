Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get from the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is acceptable in this situation."
