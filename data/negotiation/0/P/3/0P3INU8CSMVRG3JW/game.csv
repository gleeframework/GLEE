"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $20000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $14000?  That's a significant price reduction from my original offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,6,
