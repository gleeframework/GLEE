"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal on this round.",875000.0,Alice,3,
