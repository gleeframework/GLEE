"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  My starting price is $900,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm happy to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $850,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value we both recognize in this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $800,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
