Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your minimum selling price to John ($1,200,000). 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and fairness of the offer. This approach can encourage Bob to accept."
