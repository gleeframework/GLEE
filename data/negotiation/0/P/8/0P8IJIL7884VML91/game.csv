"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $108? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really think that's the highest I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I really appreciate you coming up to $108.  However, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $111? It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to what we want.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $111. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $108, so I'd like to offer $109. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Bob,6,
