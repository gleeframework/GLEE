"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000, which is the original price I offered, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This will be a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price that's close to its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
