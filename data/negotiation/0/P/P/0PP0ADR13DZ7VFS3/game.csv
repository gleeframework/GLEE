"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, while also recognizing your financial limitations.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable solution. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
