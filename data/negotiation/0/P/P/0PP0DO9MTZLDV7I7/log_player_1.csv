Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is $3,000 more than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my offer by mentioning the value to Bob, hoping to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, his initial offer is too far off.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer that hopefully leads to a more acceptable price. 
* **Plan B Still Exists:**  John is still a viable option, ensuring I won't be forced into a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. I can't go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $16,000.  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Middle Ground:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget and offering a middle ground between his offer and my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning and Justification:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing why $16,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Strong but Not Unreasonable:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum threshold but suggests flexibility.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept or at least counter with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further concessions and a lower final price, potentially putting me below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This eliminates any risk and ensures a satisfactory outcome."
