"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. I can't go as low as $12000, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $16000.  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
