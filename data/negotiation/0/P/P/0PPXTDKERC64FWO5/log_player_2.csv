"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $115 is still higher than his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Reason:  Alice's offer of $110 is within Bob's budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer and he'll be stuck buying from John at a higher price."
