I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $10800. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, this is a reasonable offer considering the value to Bob and the potential for negotiation to drag on. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him and potentially needing to settle for John's lower offer."
