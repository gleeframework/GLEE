Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $25000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is far too low for this product.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $15000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
