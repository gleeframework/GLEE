Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $25,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is far too low for this product.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, $18,000 is still above your budget.  You're still in a strong negotiating position with John as an alternative, so it's worth trying to get Alice closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
