"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a strategic move. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, $10,250 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
