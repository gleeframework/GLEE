"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? That's the best I can do.",10250.0,Bob,4,
