"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is already a significant discount on what it's worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. $140 is really as low as I'm willing to go. If that works for you, I'm happy to close the deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
