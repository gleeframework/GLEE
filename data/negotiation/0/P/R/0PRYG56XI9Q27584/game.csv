"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good return on your investment, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1200000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
