{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this price gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You want at least $1,500,000, but this offer allows for potential negotiation without immediately going to John.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It clearly states the price and invites Bob to respond. 

By starting with this offer, you initiate the negotiation process and give yourself some leverage while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. You've already established a higher starting point, and rejecting Bob's offer gives you leverage to push for a better deal.  A counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your goal of $1,500,000.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $1,300,000 but still lower than your minimum of $1,500,000.  This keeps the negotiation going while maximizing your potential earnings."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you are willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential concessions from Bob.
* **Clear and concise message:** It conveys your position and invites Bob to respond.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while maintaining your goal of maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider $1,325,000 as a counteroffer. This price allows us to find a balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to your desired price, $1,325,000 is still below your minimum. It's better to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to create a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $1,325,000 but still lower than your minimum of $1,500,000. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maximizing your profit."

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase from Bob's offer:** This shows you are still willing to negotiate but are standing your ground on price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. Based on our previous discussions and considering the value of the product, I am willing to consider $1,335,000 as a counteroffer. This price aims to strike a balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough choice. While $1,335,000 is closer to your minimum than previous offers, it's still significantly lower than what you would get from John. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unlikely to budge much further. 

By selling to John, you ensure a guaranteed price that meets your minimum and avoids any further negotiation.  While you may be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob with continued negotiation, the risk of a protracted process with an uncertain outcome is too high.  

**The decision to sell to John is a strategic choice to secure a known and acceptable profit.**"
