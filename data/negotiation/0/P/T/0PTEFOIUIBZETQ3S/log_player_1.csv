"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it could really benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I want to start high to give myself room to negotiate.  $2,000,000 leaves plenty of space for us to find a middle ground. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to establish a collaborative, not confrontational, atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is also about understanding how Bob reacts. His response will give me clues about his willingness to negotiate and his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product could benefit me, $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation, but I need to push back and signal that his initial offer is unacceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you counteroffering, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000. This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but not Insulting:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not drastically. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fairness"" and the ""true value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that his offer is significantly below what we both know it's worth. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,000,000, I might consider walking away and pursuing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $1,100,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but only by $100,000. This suggests he's willing to negotiate, but his increments are too small. I'm sticking to my guns for now, as I believe I have leverage with John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,550,000? This feels like a fair offer that acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I've significantly reduced my price, moving closer to the midpoint between our previous offers. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Slightly Above John's Offer:** While I have John's guaranteed offer, I'm aiming slightly higher with Bob to leave some room for potential negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** By repeatedly using the term ""fair,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that I'm being reasonable and seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.  
* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, so putting a more appealing offer on the table might push things forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can get it for this price elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Max Value:** Bob has reached his stated value for the product ($1,200,000). It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While he claims he can get it elsewhere at this price, it might be a bluff. Even if true, finding another buyer takes time and effort.
* **Stronger Position:** I'm in a good negotiating position with John's offer. However, accepting Bob's offer brings in a sure $1,200,000 now.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a slightly higher price, but also risks losing Bob entirely. Accepting now guarantees a good deal."
