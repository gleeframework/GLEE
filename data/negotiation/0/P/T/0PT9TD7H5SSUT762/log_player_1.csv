Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum.** This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a good price.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 
* **It highlights the value for Bob.** By mentioning the product's value to him, you're appealing to his rationality and making the offer more attractive.

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message based on Bob's reaction. Good luck with your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. While you could accept his offer and secure a sale, it's not in your best interest to sell for such a low price.  

By rejecting his offer, you maintain the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price. You can now make a counteroffer that is more in line with your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Meet your minimum price point:**  $150 is the lowest you're willing to go without losing money.
* **Maintain a negotiation stance:**  You're not immediately accepting his offer, showing that you're still willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value proposition for Bob:** You're reminding him of the product's value to him while offering a reasonable price. 

By counteroffering at $150, you're giving Bob a chance to come closer to your desired price while still maintaining your bottom line."
