"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $16000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your perceived value and my own. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still valuing the product highly, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I'm offering a counteroffer of $16250. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's my final one. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $16500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16500.0,Alice,7,
