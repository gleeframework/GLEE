Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low.  It's less than what I would get selling to another buyer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $1,100,000 is low, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Perhaps we can agree on $1,220,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000.
