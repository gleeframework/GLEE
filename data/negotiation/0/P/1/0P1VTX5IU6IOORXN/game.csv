"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. This is a fair price that's still a great deal for you, but also reflects the value I'm looking to get for this product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
