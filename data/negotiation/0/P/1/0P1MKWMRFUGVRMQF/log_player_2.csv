"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to purchase your product today."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your maximum offer of $1,200,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,210,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a good deal for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While it's close, you're not comfortable exceeding your $1,200,000 limit.
* **You have 5 rounds left.** While there's still time to negotiate, it's likely Alice won't go lower than $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price.** It's the most risk-free option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
