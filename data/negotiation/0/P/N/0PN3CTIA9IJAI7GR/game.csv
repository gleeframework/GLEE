"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get the price I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's still a great deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to make this work. How about $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,6,
