"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, we're offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. We hope this aligns well with your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $15,000, Bob can still do better. He has the option to buy from John for $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I expect to gain. Let's see if we can work this out."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To further accommodate your needs while ensuring a fair deal for both parties, I am proposing a price of $13,500 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my initial offer and a reduction from your counteroffer, aiming for a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially do better. He has the option to buy from John for $12,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we can meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $13,000 for the product, which represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I believe we can find common ground. I propose a final offer of $13,250 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous positions and aims to ensure a satisfactory outcome for both of us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,250 is close to Bob's desired price, he's already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Alice is unlikely to budge much further. At this point, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  This is a better deal than anything Alice is offering, so it makes sense for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
