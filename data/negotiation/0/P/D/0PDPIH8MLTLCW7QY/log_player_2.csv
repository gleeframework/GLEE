"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a better deal.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000, which is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price. This is intended to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. At $11,000, the product is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate or losing out on the product altogether."
