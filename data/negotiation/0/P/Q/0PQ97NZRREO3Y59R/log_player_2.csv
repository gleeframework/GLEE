"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $11,500.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best deal Bob can get without risking getting a worse offer or having to buy from John for $12,000.  While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Alice would agree, and Bob could end up paying more.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 secures a good price while minimizing risk."
