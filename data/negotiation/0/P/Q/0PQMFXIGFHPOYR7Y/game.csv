"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
