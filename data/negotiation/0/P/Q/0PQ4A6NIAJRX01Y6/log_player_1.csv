Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the strategy involved:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your decision - this offer is time-sensitive."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""time-sensitive"" element adds a bit of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible offer.  You could start higher and be willing to negotiate down. 
* A lot depends on your risk tolerance. A lower offer is more likely to be accepted, but you might leave money on the table."
