"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take that option and save $1,500. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price within Bob's budget."
