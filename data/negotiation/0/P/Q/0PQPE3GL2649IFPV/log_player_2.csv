"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $115. I think it's a great deal and I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $110?  I'm really hoping to get a good deal on this."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  Bob is starting with a small counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to budge but not making a drastic jump that might alienate her.
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to secure a price closer to his limit."
