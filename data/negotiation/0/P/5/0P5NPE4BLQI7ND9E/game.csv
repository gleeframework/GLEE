"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $130 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Can you consider that?,127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $129? It's a small step closer to your price, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. Can we try $128? It's just $1 less than your previous offer, and I'm willing to make a decision at this price.",128.0,Bob,6,
