Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fair Offer:**  $14,000 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring I still make a good profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my initial offer. There's a good chance I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob expressed initial interest.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially drive the price closer to my ideal outcome. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John now would guarantee a profit, but I believe I can do better by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $13,750? This would ensure we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $13,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable deal. 
* **Clear and Concise:** My message is direct and to the point, focusing on the price and emphasizing the fairness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking that $13,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob has firmly stuck to his $13,500 offer, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $13,500 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good profit and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Further negotiation could drag on indefinitely, and there's a chance Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a good profit.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could cost valuable time, potentially leading to delays and missed opportunities."
