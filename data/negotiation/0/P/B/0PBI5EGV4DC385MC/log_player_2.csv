"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150 from John, you can likely get a better deal from Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to Alice's value of $100.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing your desire to bargain. It also leaves room for Alice to counter at a price that's still above her value but lower than your maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still higher than my ideal price. While it's closer to my maximum, I can likely push for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price.  It's a compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable offer that Alice might accept, considering her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my maximum.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it's likely that I won't get much more. 

Considering the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and the possibility of needing to buy from John at $150, accepting this offer is the most sensible decision."
