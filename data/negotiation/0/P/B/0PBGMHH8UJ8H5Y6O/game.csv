"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $550,000.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $550,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $625,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $675,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  To show you I'm serious, I'll increase my offer to $640,000. Hopefully, that bridges the gap.",640000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $640,000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $660,000. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise.",660000.0,Alice,7,
