"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount for you, while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to stick with my strategy of slowly moving towards my goal.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $1,075,000 is still not a workable price for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
