"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1050000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects a significant discount for you, while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than your desired range. It's worth pushing further to see if you can get her closer to your target of $1,050,000.  You have several rounds left to negotiate and there's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $1075000 is still not a workable price for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1090000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is closer to your desired price point of $1,050,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a good deal considering the alternative of buying from John for $1,200,000. You still have a few rounds left, but the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing. It's wise to accept this offer and secure the product."
