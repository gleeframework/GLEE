"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her valuation.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. My hope is that it will encourage Alice to lower her price more quickly, while still demonstrating my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly. She only reduced her offer by $1,000. I'll reject again and try to push the price closer to $11,000.  There's still a safe margin before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping it firmly below $12,000. This puts the pressure on her to either accept a price closer to her valuation or make a significant concession herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Alice raised her price, signaling that she might be getting impatient. However, her ""lowest offer"" is still too high.  I'll reject and make one final counteroffer. If she doesn't accept, I'll take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $13,500 is just too far from what I can do.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This is my final offer. It matches Alice's valuation, so she's guaranteed to make a profit if she accepts. By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm making it clear that I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary. This might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
