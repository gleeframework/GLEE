"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $120 limit, but also recognizes that $95 is a good starting point for negotiation. This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is a better deal than $120 from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is aiming to save even more and can potentially get a lower price. He should try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's getting closer to Alice's offer. He's framing it as a fair price for both of them, which could appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal.  The offer is still within his budget, and it gives Alice a chance to make a small concession without sacrificing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can do $108, but that's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving money. Accepting Alice's offer at $108 allows Bob to buy the product for less than John's price, saving him $12.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John. The offer is a good compromise, and accepting it ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price."
