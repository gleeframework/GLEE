"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $850,000?  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price even lower, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
