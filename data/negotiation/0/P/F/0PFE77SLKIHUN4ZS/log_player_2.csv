"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll be impressed once you learn more about it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time opportunity to own a truly unique and valuable item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm very interested in your product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This price is within my budget and allows for potential future compromise.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it is still outside my budget. It is worth trying to negotiate further and see if we can find a compromise.  I can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to my maximum budget and leaves room for a small concession on my part. It shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but need to stay within my financial constraints.  I've also emphasized the value I see in the product to potentially sway her decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1400000. I'm offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget than before, it's still higher than my maximum. I am willing to consider buying from John for $1,500,000, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $1,600,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is my absolute final offer, and it represents a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer and is my absolute maximum budget. I've emphasized that I'm willing to walk away if this offer is not accepted, putting pressure on Alice to consider it.  By stating my willingness to invest a large amount, I'm trying to appeal to her desire to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1500000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1700000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget. I've reached my absolute maximum price limit and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better deal.  Given that I have the option to buy the same product from John for $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save $200,000."
