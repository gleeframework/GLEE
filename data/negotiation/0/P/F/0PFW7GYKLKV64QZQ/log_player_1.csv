Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.

Bob is still significantly underselling the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at this price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

Bob seems stuck at $1,200,000 and is unlikely to move significantly. It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John."
