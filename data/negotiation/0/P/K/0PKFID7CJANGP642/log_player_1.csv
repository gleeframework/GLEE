Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher price ($15,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The phrase ""limited-time offer"" aims to encourage Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Backup plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing her the minimum price of $10,000. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. It's important to consider if a more collaborative approach might be beneficial for long-term business relationships, even if it means slightly lower initial profit."
