**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly using a strategy of small concessions to try and get me to agree to a price higher than I want to pay.  She's rejected two reasonable offers in a row and her counter-offers are barely budging.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a price even closer to $100. I'm better off taking the guaranteed price of $100 from John."
