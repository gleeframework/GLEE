"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise from my last offer.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1,200,000.  This is the absolute minimum I can accept, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
