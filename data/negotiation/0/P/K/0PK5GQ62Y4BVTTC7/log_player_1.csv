"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common negotiation strategy to start high, especially when you don't know the buyer's value. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **$10,000 is a good starting point:** It's significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000) but not outrageous. 
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its uniqueness, but I believe I can only afford $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $9,500 is better than $8,000, I still have room to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **More rounds available:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, which gives me leverage to continue negotiating.
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's willing to come up further, and I can gauge his true interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value the product highly,  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This price reflects the unique value it offers. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). 
* **Showing flexibility:**  This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal but am still willing to negotiate. 
* **Encouraging discussion:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only commit to $9600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $400 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I can still try to negotiate a small increase in price if Bob seems amenable to it later on. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
