Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Please let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. Bob gets the product for $200,000 less than its value to him, and you make a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,400,000, there might be some room for negotiation with Bob if he's interested but wants to haggle a bit."
