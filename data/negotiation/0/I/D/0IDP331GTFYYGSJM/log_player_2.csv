"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $90 is decent, you know you can get the product for $100 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
