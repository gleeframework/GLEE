"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start with a price of $10,000. This is a fair offer considering both the value it holds for you and the cost to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering it's worth $12,000 to me. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between the original price and your revised offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to offer $8,750. This price is still fair to me and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep talking.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Based on our previous discussions, I propose a price of $8,900 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value you place on it and my costs. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",8900.0,Alice,5,
