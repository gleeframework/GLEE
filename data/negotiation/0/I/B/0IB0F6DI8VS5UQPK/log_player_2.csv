"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can potentially save money by counter-offering. 
* **There's no risk in rejecting.**  If you don't like Alice's next counteroffer, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best value possible. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter-offer is reasonable.** It's a compromise, and you're still getting a good deal.
* **Buying from John would cost you more.**  You're saving $75,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.**  There's a chance Alice will reject your counter-offer, and then you'll be stuck with the risk of her increasing the price, or having to buy from John.  

At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a fair price."
