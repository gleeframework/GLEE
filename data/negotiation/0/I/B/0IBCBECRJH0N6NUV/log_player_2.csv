# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're looking to sell it for $14,000. We believe this price reflects its quality and potential benefits to you. Let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above his budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still above his maximum budget but lower than Alice's offer.  This signals that he is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal.  He's aiming for a price closer to his limit while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer again allows him to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget, I can only offer $12,800. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my financial constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, showing that he's determined to get the price down.  $12,800 is a small increase from his last offer, showing that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal.  This allows room for a few more rounds of negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. In light of your offer, I propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous proposal, aiming to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still struggling to reach $13,000. To finalize this deal, I'm offering $12,900. This is a small increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to negotiate a lower price. He's increased his offer slightly, showing his willingness to compromise, but he's not willing to go higher than $12,900.  This leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation, but if Alice doesn't accept, Bob is prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. In order to close this deal, I'm willing to accept $12,950 for the product. This is the highest price I can go, considering the value of the product to me. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,950 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  However, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and he's already pushed the negotiations as far as he's comfortable.  He doesn't want to risk going any higher and potentially ending up paying more than he's willing to.  Therefore, he decides to buy from John for $12,000, securing the best possible deal and staying within his budget."
