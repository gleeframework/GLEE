Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth far more than my asking price of $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation Isn't Realistic:** In a real-world scenario, you (Alice) wouldn't know Bob values the product at $8,000.  Your negotiation strategy needs to focus on maximizing your potential profit.
* **Starting High:** It's generally a good idea to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price significantly higher than John's offer, you leave room for Bob to negotiate and potentially still reach a price that's beneficial for you. 

**Important Note:** While you know John will buy the product for $15,000, it's usually best to avoid mentioning this to Bob. Revealing your backup plan weakens your negotiating position."
