"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to move forward with the deal if we can agree on this price. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial. Let's compromise at $950,000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still making this purchase accessible for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
