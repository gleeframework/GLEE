"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from owning this product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
