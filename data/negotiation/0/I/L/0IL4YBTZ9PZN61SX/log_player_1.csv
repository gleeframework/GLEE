Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $12,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a high price while acknowledging that Bob has alternative options."
