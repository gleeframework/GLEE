"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
