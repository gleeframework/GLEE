# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and worth every penny. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's valued at $150. Considering its worth and the benefits it provides, I am extending this opportunity to you at the same price. Don't miss out on this chance to experience the best! Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $150.  There is no benefit to accepting her offer since you can buy the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller in the future."
