Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can determine how serious he is about buying.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
