"Alice, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $9,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to finalize this purchase, and I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While $10,000 is getting closer, my budget is still a bit tight. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let's make this happen!",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $9,750 is still below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,7,
