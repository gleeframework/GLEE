"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the value of this product. While $2,300,000 represents a fair assessment of its worth, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this adjustment brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
