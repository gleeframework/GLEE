"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  How about $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. $11,000 is closer, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. Let's try $11,250.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.",11250.0,Alice,5,
