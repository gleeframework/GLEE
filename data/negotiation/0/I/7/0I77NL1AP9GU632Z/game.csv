"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $700,000? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects both the value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to move my price up slightly. How about $710,000?  I feel this is a strong offer and hope we can close the deal soon.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to move closer to my target price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $720,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",720000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $715,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,9,
