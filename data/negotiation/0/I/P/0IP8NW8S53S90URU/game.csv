,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer you the product for $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest.",95.0,Alice,5,
