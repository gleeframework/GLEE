"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $800000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still reflects the value of the product, but it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is a significant improvement, I am still unable to meet at that price point. I would like to propose $1200000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1475000.  This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. However, I am unable to agree to $1475000. I would like to counter with $1300000. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
