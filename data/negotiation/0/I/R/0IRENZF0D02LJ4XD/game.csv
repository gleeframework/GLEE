"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about being fairly compensated, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget limit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,800. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. How about we meet at $11,200?",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and my original offer of $9,500. How about we meet at $10,350?",10350.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the creative compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable meeting you at $10,350. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",10750.0,Bob,10,
