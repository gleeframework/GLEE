"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my best offer, let me know if you're willing to work with me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
