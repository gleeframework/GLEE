"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  $1,400,000 is a little too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and my maximum. Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
