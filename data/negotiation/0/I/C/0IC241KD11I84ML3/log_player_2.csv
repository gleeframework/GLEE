Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now approaching your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is increasing.  It's safer to buy from John for $1,500,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget and avoid further negotiation that might lead to no deal."
