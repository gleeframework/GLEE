"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $16000?  This is a significant price drop from my initial offer, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.  Let me know if this works for you!",16000.0,Alice,5,
