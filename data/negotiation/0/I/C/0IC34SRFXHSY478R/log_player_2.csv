Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's close to his target price of $8,000, and there's still a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. There are 5 rounds left, and he can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,900. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice has come down to $8,900, Bob has only two rounds left to negotiate. There's a risk that Alice will refuse further concessions, leaving Bob with a price higher than his target.  It's safer to take the guaranteed $8,000 deal from John."
