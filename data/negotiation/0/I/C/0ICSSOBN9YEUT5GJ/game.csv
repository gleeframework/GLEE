"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
