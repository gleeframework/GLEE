"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $160, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really don't think I can go as high as $160. How about we meet at $145? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to save some cash",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $145 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155, which is a good compromise. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. ",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155, so how about $150? I'm really trying to stay within my budget",150.0,Bob,6,
