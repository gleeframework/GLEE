Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (so he'll accept) but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be slightly bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm offering it to you at a premium price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand,"" you create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **""Fair Deal"":** Framing it this way emphasizes the product's benefits to Bob, not just your profit.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could walk away. Be prepared to potentially negotiate downward slightly if he counters."
