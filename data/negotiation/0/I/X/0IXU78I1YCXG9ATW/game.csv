"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us,  as it allows me to acquire the product and you to still receive its full value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 wouldn't allow me to realize the full value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to meet in the middle.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
