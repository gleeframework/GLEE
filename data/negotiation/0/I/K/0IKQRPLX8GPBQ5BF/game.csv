"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $110?  I really want this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
