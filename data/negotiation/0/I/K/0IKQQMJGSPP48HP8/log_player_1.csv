Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find a lot of value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start there.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still keeping the price significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes that Bob is getting the first opportunity and hints at the product's value, hoping to justify the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a chance Bob might outright reject this offer. However, it positions Alice to potentially gain more than simply selling to John immediately."
