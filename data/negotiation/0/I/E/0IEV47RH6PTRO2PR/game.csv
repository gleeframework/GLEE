,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some.  However, to be candid,  $900,000 is still pushing my budget limits.  Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant move on my end.",725000.0,Bob,4,
