"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better. $900,000 is still a significant amount of money, and he has room to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to Alice's value.  This shows he's serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation.  He's aiming to close the deal quickly while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob aims for.  There's still room to negotiate, and with 7 rounds remaining, he can likely secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This shows good faith and could be a good starting point for a deal.  Alice might accept this, or she might counter with a slightly higher price. Either way, Bob is getting closer to his goal."
