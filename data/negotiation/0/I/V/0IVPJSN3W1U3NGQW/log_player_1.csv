"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $17,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping Bob will counter with a reasonable offer that we can work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price.  I will counter with a higher offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my desired price. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to accept yet, and I'm confident I can push for a bit more.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to considering selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,750. This is a compromise, but still a decent profit for me. I'm nearing the point where John's offer is looking more appealing, so I need to get closer to my desired price with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm going to counter one more time to see if I can get closer to $14,500. If that fails, I'll probably sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum and we're running out of time.  John's offer is a sure thing, and I'm confident I can't get a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
