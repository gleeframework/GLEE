"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I'm thinking of a price of $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your budget or just buy it from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($60) leaves room for negotiation while signaling your budget limitations. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is courteous while clearly stating your price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're willing to compromise, encouraging Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $60, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above your maximum budget. You're closer to John's price, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her offer ($90) and your previous offer ($60). 
* **Stronger Language:**  The phrasing ""settle at $75"" and ""fair compromise"" implies this is a reasonable final offer.
* **Staying Below Max:** It keeps you below your $80 maximum while leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $85, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $85. While you could try another counteroffer, it's risky. She might not budge, and you'll end up having to take the $85 or restart the negotiation with less leverage. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than Alice's current offer."
