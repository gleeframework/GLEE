"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product that I think you'll find very interesting. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
