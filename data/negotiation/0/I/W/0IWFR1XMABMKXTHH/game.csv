"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $9,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
