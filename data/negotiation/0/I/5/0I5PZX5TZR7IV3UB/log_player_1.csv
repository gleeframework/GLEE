"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,750.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,600.  While I was hoping for a bit more, this is a good price and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
