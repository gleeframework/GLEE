"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $12,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",12000.0,Alice,5,
