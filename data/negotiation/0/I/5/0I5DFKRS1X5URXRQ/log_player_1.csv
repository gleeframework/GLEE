{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, there's a chance Bob will accept.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer is not too far from Bob's value, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Maintain control:**  The message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer.  This will allow me to:

* **Maintain my desired profit margin:** I need to find a price that gets me closer to my target of $15,000.
* **Test Bob's willingness to negotiate:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This might encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Show flexibility:** While I'm not accepting his offer, I'm willing to continue negotiating, which could lead to a mutually acceptable agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but still lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling between Bob's initial offer and my previous offer. It signals a willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message reiterates the value of the product for Bob, and emphasizes the compromise I'm making. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:** By not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, increasing the chances of a successful agreement.
* **Move towards a mutually acceptable price:**  The counteroffer is designed to find a compromise point between my desired price and Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000.  However, I believe there's still potential for a better outcome with Bob.  If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll need to reassess my options and potentially consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would still result in a loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed with another counteroffer.  This allows me to:

* **Maintain my desired profit margin:** I'm still striving to get closer to my target of $15,000.
* **Show persistence:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my value.
* **Explore further negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his last offer. I'll aim to find a price that balances my desired profit and Bob's perceived value. If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."

```

**Explanation:**
