"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds. I'm confident you'll see the benefits of this deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good deal.
* **Message:** I've kept the message concise and positive, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a fair deal. 

**Strategy:**

My initial offer is designed to test the waters and see how receptive Bob is to the deal. I'm aiming to maximize my profits, but I also want to keep the negotiation open to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I am willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too far off the mark. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've reduced my price by $150,000 from the previous round. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm also reaffirming the value of the product. I'm emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual negotiation process that shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving away the product for a drastically reduced price. By staying above my minimum, I keep my options open while also incentivizing Bob to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer than previous offers, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a price that's closer to my target. Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob.  There's still room for compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and understanding of the product's worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've dropped my price by $50,000 from the previous round. This is a smaller reduction than before, demonstrating my commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting Bob's understanding of the product's value and acknowledging his willingness to negotiate. I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward by making a smaller concession. I'm confident that $1,550,000 is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and be willing to accept it.  If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. This is a good outcome for me, as I've secured my minimum while also reaching a deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation. While I could potentially try to negotiate a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee I'll be successful. This offer provides a safe and secure way to close the deal and ensure I achieve my financial goal."
