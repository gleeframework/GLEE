"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my maximum budget. If this works for you, we can close the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
