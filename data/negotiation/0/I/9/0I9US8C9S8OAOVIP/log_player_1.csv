Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still leaving me a profit over my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is below my minimum threshold, and while I could sell to John for $10,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $12,000 offer but still above Bob's $9,000 proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it ensures I make my minimum."
