"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000.  This would still give you a good return on the product and leave me with some room to work with.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
