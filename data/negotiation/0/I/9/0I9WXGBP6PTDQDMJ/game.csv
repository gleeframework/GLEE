"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 was a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also shows I'm willing to compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and leaves room for further negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to make concessions. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your last offer and shows I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to the price. I'll offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price is within our previously discussed range and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made some concessions already, and I'm not willing to go back to $1,100,000. I'll meet you at the middle of our previous offers, which is $1,110,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,110,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1110000.0,Alice,9,
