{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and while it's still slightly higher than my ideal, it's within my budget and closer to my target price.  At this point, with only a few rounds left, it's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a deal falling through completely.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is also a less appealing option."
