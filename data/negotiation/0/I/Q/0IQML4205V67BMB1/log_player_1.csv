Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm excited about the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. That's my best offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it's a good deal considering the limited rounds. It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
