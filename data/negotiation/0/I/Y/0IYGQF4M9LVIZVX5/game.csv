"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $7,500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I see your point, $7,500 is significantly below what I had in mind. I could be persuaded to part with it for $9,200.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
