**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is clearly unwilling to meet Alice's price expectations.  While he's incrementally increasing his offer, the pace is slow, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than his current offer of $1,540,000.

Alice has a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John. Accepting Bob's current offer would only net her $340,000 more.  Continuing the negotiation risks Bob walking away entirely or taking up valuable time with minimal increases. 

It's more profitable and less risky for Alice to cut her losses now and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
