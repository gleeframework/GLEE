"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? I believe that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my serious interest in purchasing your product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
