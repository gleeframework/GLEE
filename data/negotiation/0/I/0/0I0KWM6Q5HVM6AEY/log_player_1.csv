While $1,400,000 is a good offer, we are still early in the negotiation and Bob has shown a willingness to move on price.  Let's see if we can push for a bit more before accepting."

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and meet in the middle. Waiting any longer carries the risk of him reducing his offer or even walking away. $1,425,000 is a strong price, netting a gain of $225,000 above my minimum. It's a good point to settle."
