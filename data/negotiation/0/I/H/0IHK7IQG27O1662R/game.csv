"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm still willing to negotiate, but that's the lowest I can go.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $110. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,5,
