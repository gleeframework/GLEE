"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000 to facilitate the deal. This still represents great value for you, and it gets us closer to a successful transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $8,500, which is closer to my desired price range.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a bit more, there's a risk that he might walk away or we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum."
