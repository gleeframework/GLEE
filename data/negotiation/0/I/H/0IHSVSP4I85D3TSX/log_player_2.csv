""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $650,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $725,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to secure a valuable product.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can both achieve. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches the price John is offering. There's no benefit to haggling further, as you're unlikely to get a better price from Alice and you'd be wasting time."
