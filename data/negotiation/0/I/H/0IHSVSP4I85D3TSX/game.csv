"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $650,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's find common ground!",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $725,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to secure a valuable product.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can both achieve.",800000.0,Alice,5,
