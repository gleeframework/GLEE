Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $10,500 is still more than he's willing to pay. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further."
