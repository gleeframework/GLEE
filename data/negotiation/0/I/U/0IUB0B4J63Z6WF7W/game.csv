"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing further.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is already a significant discount on my end.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm happy to offer $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
