"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value we both know it holds. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is within Bob's budget and aligns with his goal of saving as much money as possible.  This is the best offer Bob can reasonably expect to get from Alice, and accepting it will allow him to buy the product at a price that is only slightly above his ideal.  While he could reject and try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice would hold firm at this price, and Bob might risk losing the deal entirely. Buying from John would cost him the same amount, so there's no benefit to that option."
