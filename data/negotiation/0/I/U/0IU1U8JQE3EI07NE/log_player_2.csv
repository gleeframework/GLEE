"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $11,000. This is a good deal, but you can potentially save more.
* **Negotiation:** You have the opportunity to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price.
* **Alternative:**  While John offers the product for $12,000, you want to exhaust all options with Alice before committing to that price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to further negotiation and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower offer, emphasizing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Midpoint:** The $9,500 price is a midpoint between Alice's desired price ($8,000) and your maximum budget ($12,000). This creates room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,000?  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $10,000 is within your budget and significantly better than John's price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation:** While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer secures a good deal and saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price, but also risks Alice walking away or ending up with a worse deal. 

Accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures you get a good value for the product."
