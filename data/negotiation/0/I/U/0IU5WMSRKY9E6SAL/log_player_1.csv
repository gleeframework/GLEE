Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, a price of $1,400,000 might seem high. However, the message emphasizes the product's value and the risk of missing out. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This initial offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate if he's interested, but still secures a significant profit for me.
* **Time Value of Money:** A faster sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, can be advantageous compared to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase."
