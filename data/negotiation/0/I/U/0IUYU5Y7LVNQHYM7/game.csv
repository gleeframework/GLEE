"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $900,000. I'm willing to make a significant investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from its true value and a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $975,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this transaction quickly.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",960000.0,Bob,6,
