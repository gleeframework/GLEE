Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, we want to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if he counter-offers.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's input, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counter-offer), Alice can adjust her strategy in subsequent interactions to try and reach a deal that benefits her."
