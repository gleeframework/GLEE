Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially reaching an even higher price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, ensuring I don't lose money. 

By starting high, I increase my chances of securing the best possible deal while minimizing risk."
