(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still $100,000 over his maximum. He can likely negotiate further with Alice or buy from John."

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to stay within his budget. This is a reasonable compromise."
