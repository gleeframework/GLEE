Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll see that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, and you are running the risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice will not budge further, and you might end up buying from John at the same price."
