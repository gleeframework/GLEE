"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which still represents a great value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll see that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
