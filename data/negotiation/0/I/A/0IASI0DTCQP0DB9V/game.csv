"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's a great compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $122.  This is my final offer.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $122 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you $128. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,7,
