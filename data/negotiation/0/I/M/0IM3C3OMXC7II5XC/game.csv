"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit.  Let's make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13250. This is a reasonable price for a product of this quality. Let's close this deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $12800. Can you meet me at this price?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $12800 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $13000.  This is a fair price, and I think we should close this deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm going to meet you in the middle at $12950.  This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close this deal. If not, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",12950.0,Alice,9,
