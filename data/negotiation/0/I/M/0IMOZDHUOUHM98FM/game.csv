"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'll meet you at $102. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
