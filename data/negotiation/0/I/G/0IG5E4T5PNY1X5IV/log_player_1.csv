Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value, but based on my research and needs, I am not able to pay such a high price. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $1500000? I would greatly value your product within this budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
