"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value, but based on my research and needs, I am not able to pay such a high price. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $1500000? I would greatly value your product within this budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While I value the product highly and believe it's worth more than $1500000, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.
