Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have some leverage as I can sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,250,000. While this is still lower than I ideally want, it's only $50,000 away from John's offer. It's in my best interest to accept and secure the sale rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
