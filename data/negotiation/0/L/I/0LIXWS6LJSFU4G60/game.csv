"Alice,  your product is great, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price, given that I can get the same product from John for $10,000.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you for a lower price than I could get from John.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering I can get the product for $10,000 elsewhere.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm already willing to sell it to you for a lower price than I could get from John.",11250.0,Alice,5,
