"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone with your needs.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept, you're better off rejecting and using the remaining rounds to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you place on the product at $8,000, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than $10,000.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. You have 7 rounds left, so you have time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for my budget. Considering your own valuation of $8,000, I'm prepared to offer $11,000. This price is fair, and I believe it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
