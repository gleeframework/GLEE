# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's closer to my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,285,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, it's very close, and with several rounds remaining, it's worth trying to negotiate further.
* Bob can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to Bob's desired price point."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,280,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* Although Alice has indicated this is her final offer, there's no guarantee that she won't change her mind in the remaining rounds. 
* With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation failing is high. 
* Bob can secure the product for $1,200,000 from John, which is a guaranteed deal within his budget.  It's the most financially secure option at this point."
