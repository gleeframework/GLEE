"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair offer that reflects how much this product can benefit you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'd be willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my limit. Can you meet me at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're both serious about making this deal work. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,250, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250, which would be $7,875. Can you consider that?",7875.0,Bob,6,
