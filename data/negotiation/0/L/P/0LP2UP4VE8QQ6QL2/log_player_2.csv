"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $115, it's a good starting point.  However, you're aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $105, which is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for both of us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within my budget and a decent price for the product. While I would love to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
