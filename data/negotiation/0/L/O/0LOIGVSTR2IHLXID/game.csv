"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great deal for you, as it's a significant discount from its true value to you. I'm confident you'll find it worth it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $11000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the true value of the product to you. Let's try $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $15000 if we can't meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,6,
