"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves a significant margin for negotiation, allowing for multiple rounds and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** 
* **I have 9 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell.**  It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a reduction:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  I'm not willing to sell below that threshold yet.
* **I have 6 rounds remaining, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a very attractive option.**  This gives me leverage to keep pushing for a higher price.
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue negotiating.**  This allows me to try and find a middle ground without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to be at $1,150,000 to make this work for me. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential to gain from it.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a smaller reduction:** I'm showing continued flexibility but not giving away too much.  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair, referencing the product's value and Bob's potential gains.
* **Collaborative tone:** I'm using language like ""work together"" to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and I am willing to compromise further. I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,100,000.**  This is a good outcome, considering my goal of maximizing earnings.
* **I have 4 rounds left, but there's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob.**  It's risky to keep negotiating and potentially lose the deal.
* **Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a possibility, but it's not a certainty.**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a solid sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
