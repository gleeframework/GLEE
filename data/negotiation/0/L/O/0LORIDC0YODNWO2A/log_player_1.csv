"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,750,000.  This is above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see how flexible Bob is and sets the stage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option. I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my initial offer. It shows flexibility while trying to maintain a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below it. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better option at this point.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is still higher than Bob's last offer but closer to his valuation and my minimum price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm getting closer to closing a deal, the risk of getting a better offer in the remaining rounds is not worth it.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
