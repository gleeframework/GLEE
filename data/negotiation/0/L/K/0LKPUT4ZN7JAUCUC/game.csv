"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This is a fair price given your value for the product, and it leaves room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. This is still a significant discount from the $15000 value you place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However,  $10500 is still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500, which would be $9750. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",9750.0,Alice,5,
