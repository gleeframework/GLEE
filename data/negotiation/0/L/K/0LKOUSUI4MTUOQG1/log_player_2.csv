"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $125?  I'm really looking for a good deal, and I think this is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $125 is a little too low for me. How about $135? That's a good compromise, and still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $135 is less than Bob's maximum price of $150.
* **It's a good compromise:**  Alice has moved down from $140, and Bob has moved up from $125.
* **It's a better deal than John:** While John is offering the product for $150, buying from Alice for $135 saves Bob $15. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice for Bob."
