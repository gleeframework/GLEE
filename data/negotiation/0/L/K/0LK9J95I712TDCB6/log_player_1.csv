Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point for Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves room for both of us to come away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still finding it a bit steep.  Could you do $950,000?  That would make it much easier for me to commit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal. It's significantly more than selling to John and close enough to my desired price to be worth accepting."
