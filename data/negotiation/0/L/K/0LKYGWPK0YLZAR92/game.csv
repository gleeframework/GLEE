"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $800,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. I'm eager to close this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $825,000 is still a bit out of my reach. To make this deal work, I'm offering $810,000. This is a significant step towards finding a price that benefits both of us. Let's try to close this gap and finalize this agreement.",810000.0,Bob,6,
