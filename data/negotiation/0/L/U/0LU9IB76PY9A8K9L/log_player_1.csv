Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a larger profit than I'd get from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.  
* **Alternative Guaranteed:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out as I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
