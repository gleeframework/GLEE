"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. Since you're willing to pay $1,000,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, there's room for both of you to compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than your maximum price of $1,000,000. You have two good options:

1. **Reject and Counter Offer:** Since you can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John, you can counter-offer Alice with a price closer to $1,000,000. This leaves room for a final compromise.
2. **Buy from John:** If you're confident you won't be able to get a better price from Alice, you can always go with the guaranteed price from John.

However, since there's a good chance of reaching a deal with Alice at a price closer to $1,000,000, rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the more strategic approach."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than your maximum price of $1,000,000. While you could continue to counter-offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000. 

You've saved $75,000 by going with John, and the negotiation process has been long enough.  There's a chance that you might get Alice down to $1,000,000, but the risk of her rejecting your offer again isn't worth it."
