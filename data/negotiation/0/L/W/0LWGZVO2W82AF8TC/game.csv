,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",8500.0,Alice,5,
