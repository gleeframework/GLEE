Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can likely secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a good deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This is a good compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiations.  There are still several rounds left, and I can potentially get a higher offer from Bob or explore other options with John."
