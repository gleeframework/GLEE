"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  While John is a safe bet, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, you can still try to get a lower price. You're close to your target price of $10,000 and you know John is willing to sell at that price. Let's see if you can get Alice to go lower!"

You've already reached a point where you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you've already spent a few rounds and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to $10,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
