"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you're getting a valuable product at a price that's below its true worth, and I'm getting a good return on my investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $900,000.  You can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for $800,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $875,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting a valuable product for significantly less than its worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could try to negotiate a lower price, you run the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again.  Accepting her offer at $875,000 still saves you money compared to buying from John."
