"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you're getting a valuable product at a price that's below its true worth, and I'm getting a good return on my investment. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $875,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting a valuable product for significantly less than its worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
