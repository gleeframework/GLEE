"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you consider a price closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $17,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,500.  Do you think we can find an agreement around there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the increase in your offer, $11,500 is still too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be honest, the most I can go is $12,000.  I understand if that's not feasible for you, but I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
