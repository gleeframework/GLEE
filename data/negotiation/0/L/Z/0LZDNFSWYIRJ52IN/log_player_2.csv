"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $12,000 you estimate its worth. However, to make this opportunity more accessible, I propose a special introductory price of $10,000 for you. This is an exceptional deal considering the quality and benefits the product offers. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further or if there's anything else I can assist you with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
