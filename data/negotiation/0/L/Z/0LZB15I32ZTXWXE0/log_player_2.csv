"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's close to his maximum budget, but leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but also highlights his price limit. By offering $8,500, Bob is testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $9,500 is still above Bob's target price. It's likely she's willing to go lower. Rejecting allows Bob to counteroffer again and hopefully get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a compromise, halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates that he's serious about getting a deal but still wants to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,750 is still above his comfort zone.  Rejecting allows him to counteroffer one more time and potentially get a better deal.  There are still rounds left, so it's not too risky to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to slowly increase his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still keeping his budget in mind.  $9,250 is a good compromise point, showing that he's serious about buying the product, but also wants to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,900 is very close to Bob's maximum budget. It's likely that further negotiations will result in a price closer to $9,750 or $9,500. However, Bob has only 3 rounds left.  There is a risk that Alice will not budge further and Bob will end up paying more than he wants.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, it is safer for Bob to buy the product from John and secure the deal."
