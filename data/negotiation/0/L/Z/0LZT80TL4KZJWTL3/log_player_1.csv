"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations significantly above your minimum price. This gives you room to negotiate and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,""  you subtly reinforce that the price is not arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""a fair starting point"" signals that you're open to discussion and potential price adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant amount above his perceived value. You have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal. Selling to John right now would mean losing out on a potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's true worth is closer to my initial proposal. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $2,000,000 for this unique product?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Shows you're taking his perspective into account.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Subtly reminds Bob about the product's worth without being too aggressive. 
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:**  The $250,000 decrease signals flexibility, but you're still aiming for a price well above your absolute minimum. 
* **""Middle Ground"" Language:**  Encourages a collaborative approach to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still below our ideal target. Bob's latest offer also suggests he's willing to go a bit higher. It's worth pushing a little further, but we should start considering smaller concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. I'm ready to be flexible to close this deal. How about we meet halfway at $1,850,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my eagerness to work with you."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlighting Shared Understanding:** By emphasizing Bob's recognition of the product's value, you reinforce his positive perception.
* **""Meet Halfway"" Tactic:**  This creates a sense of fairness and compromise, even though the midpoint might not be perfectly mathematically calculated. 
* **""Significant Compromise"":**  This language emphasizes your flexibility and willingness to make a deal, potentially motivating Bob to reciprocate.
* **Expressing Eagerness:**  Conveying your desire to work with Bob adds a personal touch and reinforces the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but I think we can do even better than that. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price from Bob. We're already close to his likely maximum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Delaying the sale means delaying the opportunity to use those funds for other potentially profitable ventures.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing Bob too hard might cause him to walk away altogether, leaving you with John's lower offer. 

$1,750,000 is a solid profit, and accepting now secures a good deal without risking the loss of the sale."
