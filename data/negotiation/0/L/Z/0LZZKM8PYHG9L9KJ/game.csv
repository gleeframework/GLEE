"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  I think this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth. ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This still reflects a substantial discount and I believe is a very reasonable offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
