**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's standing offer of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him stalling or the deal falling through. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
