"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable for your budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I can offer you the product for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable for your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I can tell we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us. I'd be willing to bump my offer up to $750,000.  Hopefully that bridges the gap.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $775,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, as it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.
