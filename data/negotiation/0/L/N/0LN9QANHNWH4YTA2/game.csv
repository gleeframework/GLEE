"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about expenses, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your life.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $10200, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm going to counteroffer at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your life.",11000.0,Alice,5,
