Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly drawing a hard line, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $775,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
