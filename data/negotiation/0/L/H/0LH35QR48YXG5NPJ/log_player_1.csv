{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to negotiate and still find the price acceptable.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left some space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress. 

By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down if necessary, while still leaving the potential for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $9,800 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. I think that's a fair price for the product and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,250 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit. It's also a good compromise, showing that we're both willing to meet in the middle."
