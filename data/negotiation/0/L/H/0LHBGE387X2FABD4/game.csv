"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,025,000 is still not acceptable. How about we split the difference and go with $1,062,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1062500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,062,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1,025,000, so how about we try $1,037,500?",1037500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,037,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, so how about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1,037,500, so how about we try $1,043,750?",1043750.0,Bob,6,
