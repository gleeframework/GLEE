"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a great price for something that will benefit you so much. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with Alice further or explore other options to potentially get a better price."
