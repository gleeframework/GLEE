Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I would receive from another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's within Bob's range:** $950,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further without sacrificing too much profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to push for a better deal.  There's a good chance Bob is willing to go a bit higher, especially since he acknowledged the product's value to him.  A counteroffer will allow you to gauge his true willingness to pay."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value you see in this product, I believe $850,000 is a fair compromise.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and allows me to earn a more reasonable return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. How about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and still leaves room for Bob to profit. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
