Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids potential delays of finding another buyer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product."
