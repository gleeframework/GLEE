I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving me room to negotiate.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
