"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,350,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,000,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is below her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal, ideally getting closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
