Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,350,000 vs. $1,000,000), Alice sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Emphasizing value:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to make the product seem more desirable to Bob.
* **Guaging Bob's interest:** This initial offer allows Alice to assess Bob's level of interest and potentially adjust her strategy in further negotiations.

**Important:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000,  so she's starting high with Bob and willing to walk away if needed."
