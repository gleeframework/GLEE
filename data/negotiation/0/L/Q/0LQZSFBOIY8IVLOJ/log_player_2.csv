"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to be incredibly valuable, worth far more than its market price. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you.  While I can't disclose the details just yet, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true potential value. Let me know your thoughts, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for a much lower price."
