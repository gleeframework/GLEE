"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}

```tool_code
print(""Reason:Start with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. This offer is closer to my target price while still being significantly below Alice's valuation, potentially leading to a favorable deal."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
