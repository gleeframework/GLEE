"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for him to counter-offer. This also gives me a chance to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal,  $60 is significantly less than my minimum value of $120.  I'll counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
