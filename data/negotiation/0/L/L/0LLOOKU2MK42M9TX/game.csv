"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000 to show my commitment to making this work.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.  Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1075000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to see a bit more commitment from your side. Let's meet in the middle at $1125000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1100000 as a final offer. I'm confident this is a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. If you're serious about buying it, I suggest you accept this offer before I move on to another buyer.

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1100000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
