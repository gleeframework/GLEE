Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I've also included a message that is friendly and open to discussion.  

Here's why this approach is a good starting point:

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** $1,000,000 is a high price, but it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Focuses on value:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for both parties, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Opens the door for negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear that you're willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while also keeping the negotiation open and engaging.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away. I want to see if I can push for a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. This will give me the chance to earn more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? It's still a great deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This signals that I'm serious about a deal but also value a good price.
* **Focus on value and speed:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and quick closure.  This subtly pressures Bob to accept, suggesting that there's value in moving forward quickly. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While I'm proposing $900,000, I'm still open to further discussion. This keeps the negotiation active and avoids a stalemate.

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850000? It's getting close to your minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a significant increase from his previous offer, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better deal from him.  

While I'd love to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $800,000 offer from John.  

To secure a sale and avoid losing out on potential profit, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $850,000."
