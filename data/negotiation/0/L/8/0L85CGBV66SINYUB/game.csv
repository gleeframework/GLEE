"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that $2,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
