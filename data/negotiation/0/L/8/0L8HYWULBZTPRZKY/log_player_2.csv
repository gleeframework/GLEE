"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Bob, but Alice is asking for $95. This leaves some room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly to $90, but Bob is still able to get a better deal.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his ideal of $85.  There is still room for Alice to compromise further, as she is willing to sell for $80.  Buying from John for $100 would be the worst outcome, so Bob should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}
