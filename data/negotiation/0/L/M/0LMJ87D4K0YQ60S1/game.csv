"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
