Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, offering him the product at that price guarantees a sale. This ensures I maximize my earnings, as any lower price would mean a loss for me. While I could try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee he'd accept, and I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000."
