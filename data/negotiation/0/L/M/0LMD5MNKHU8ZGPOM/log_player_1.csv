Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her $12,000 minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering it at $15,000 might be seen as too aggressive and could lead to immediate rejection. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
