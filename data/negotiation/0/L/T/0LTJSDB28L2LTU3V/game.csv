"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer considering the long-term return on investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I understand this is a considerable difference, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move things forward, I can come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $19,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. While I appreciate your willingness to move up, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to drop to $17,000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us. ",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair deal, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. This shows a significant effort on my part to meet you halfway.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
