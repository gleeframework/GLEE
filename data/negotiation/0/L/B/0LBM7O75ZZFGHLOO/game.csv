"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm looking to save some money, and I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,000. Let me know if you can meet me in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't meet your price of $7,000, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects a significant discount and is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
