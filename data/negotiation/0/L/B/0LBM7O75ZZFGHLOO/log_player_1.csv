Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer while still allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum ($12,000).
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob, as I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm looking to save some money, and I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,000. Let me know if you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000 now, there's a chance I can get closer to that price with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer, I can keep the negotiation going and see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't meet your price of $7,000, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects a significant discount and is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $9,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, but it offers a more enticing price for Bob compared to my previous offer.
* **Maintain Negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further discussion to potentially reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to more back-and-forth and potentially a lower final price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my desired price and a good profit.  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better deal with Bob, and the risk of a lower price isn't worth it."
