"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  This is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $120 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still only able to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's close this deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
