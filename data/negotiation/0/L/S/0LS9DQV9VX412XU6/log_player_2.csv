"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to start negotiating closer to his $8,000 limit. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** $9,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in getting a better price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly but firm, leaving room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price.  There are still multiple rounds left, so there's room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Compromise:**  The message emphasizes that $9,500 is a compromise, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message stays friendly and encourages a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $9,500 is still too far below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there is still room for negotiation.  There are five rounds left, so there's time to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm seeing your willingness to compromise.  I'm going to offer you $9,750. This is my final offer before I look elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob is signaling that this is his last offer before considering John's offer. This adds pressure to Alice.
* **Small Increment:**  The offer is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing that he's serious about getting the deal done.
* **Clear Message:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes that Bob is willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,875 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price point of $8,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further. Additionally, Bob has signaled that he's willing to walk away, so he should act on that threat. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his target price."
