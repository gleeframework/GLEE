"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $120 is a bit high, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $70? That's closer to your asking price while still saving me some money.,70.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I still need to make a profit. How about $95? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
