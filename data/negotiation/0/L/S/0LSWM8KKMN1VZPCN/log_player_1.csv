Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $11,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to reach my $10,000 minimum. It's not worth the risk of him stalling further, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
