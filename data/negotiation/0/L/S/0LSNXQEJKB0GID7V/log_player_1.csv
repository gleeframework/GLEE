"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying, and potentially get a better price if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my target of $14,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still giving me a chance to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  Let's try $12,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $14,000, $12,500 is a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating and the risk of going to John and selling for $10,000."
