Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above the guaranteed amount.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and the time pressure might encourage him to accept. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** The message subtly reminds Bob that I have other options, reducing the chance of him lowballing a counter-offer.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than the guaranteed sale to John."
