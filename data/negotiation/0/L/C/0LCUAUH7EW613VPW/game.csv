"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a good compromise, as it's still below what I'd get from another buyer.  Let's get this deal done!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal now!",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a little too far off for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  It's time to finalize this agreement, as I have another offer on the table.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can offer you $937,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this before the time runs out.",937500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting down to the wire here.  $937,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise and accept $950,000. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't reach an agreement now, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  It's up to you to decide if you want to close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,9,
