"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Alice's starting offer is quite high, considering her product's value to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation.  We'll see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still a good bit away from her value of $10,000. Let's see if we can encourage her to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  To be honest, $12,000 is the highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

We're holding our ground at $12,000. This offer is pushing our limit but leaves some room for Alice to potentially accept if she's willing to compromise further."
