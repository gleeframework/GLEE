Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one last concession. If you're willing to meet me halfway between our last two offers, we can close the deal at $102.50. This is my final offer.

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and while she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach our $80 comfort zone.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
