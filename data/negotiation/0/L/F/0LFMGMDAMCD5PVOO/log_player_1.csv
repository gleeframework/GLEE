Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can lower the price if needed to reach a deal with Bob.
* **It reflects the value of the product to me:**  My minimum price is $12,000, so this offer leaves room for profit.

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price. If he rejects, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low.  While it's better than nothing, it doesn't meet my minimum requirement of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a compromise: it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiations."
