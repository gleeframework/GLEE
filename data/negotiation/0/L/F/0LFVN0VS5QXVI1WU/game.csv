"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $850,000? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
