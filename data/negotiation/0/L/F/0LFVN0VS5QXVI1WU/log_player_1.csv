Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You've stated that you won't sell for less than $800,000, so this offer is well above that.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so there's room for him to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth and potentially getting closer to your desired price.

By starting with a strong offer and being open to negotiation, you have a good chance of maximizing your profit while still potentially striking a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and while it's tempting to take the $700,000, selling to John for $800,000 is a better option in this round.  You can potentially get a better deal from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $850,000? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  It firmly states that $700,000 is unacceptable.
* **Offers a compromise:** It presents a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum.
* **Remains open to negotiation:** It invites Bob to respond and potentially find a mutually acceptable price. 

This approach maintains your position while showing a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $800,000 you'd get from John.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer could potentially lead to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:** It reaffirms that $775,000 is still too low.
* **Offers a compromise:** It's a small move closer to Bob's offer, but still above your minimum and closer to what John is offering.
* **Highlights value:**  It reminds Bob of the product's worth, justifying the price.

This strategy aims to maintain your negotiating position while showing a continued willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  How about $800,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer matches the price you can get from John.  Since there's no potential for a higher price with Bob, it's better to sell to John and secure the deal."
