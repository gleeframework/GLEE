{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, which may encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree it's a good deal, I'm aiming to get it for a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum, it's still less than I'd like to get. I'll see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you consider $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
