Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher.  How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  $9,500 is a decent deal, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer."
