Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, you start higher to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above the baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is significantly higher than your minimum, it leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing you to potentially settle somewhere above $1,200,000.
* **Politeness and Openness:** The tone is polite and invites Bob to engage in a discussion, making him more likely to consider the offer seriously."
