"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $110.

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Could you come down a little?"",

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $105, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is within my acceptable range. It's better to secure the deal now at $105 than risk pushing her too far and having to buy from John at $120."
