"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I'm still not there.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
