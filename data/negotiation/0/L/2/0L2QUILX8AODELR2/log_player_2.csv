"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Even though Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than John's price.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $400,000."
