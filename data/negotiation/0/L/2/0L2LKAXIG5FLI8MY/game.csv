"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,500,000. Given its value to you, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I think $1,350,000 is a little high.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than $1,100,000. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's worth to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000, as that's the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Considering our previous discussions, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
