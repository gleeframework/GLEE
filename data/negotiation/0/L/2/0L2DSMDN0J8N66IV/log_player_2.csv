"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you, but I understand the price needs to be right. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial offer, but it reflects the true worth of the product. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss it further. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While the product may be valuable, it's not worth overpaying. It's better to reject the offer and purchase the product from John for a price within your budget."
