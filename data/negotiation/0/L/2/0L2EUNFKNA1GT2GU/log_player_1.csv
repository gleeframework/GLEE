Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (""great deal for the value"") might make Bob more receptive.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important:**  It's crucial to remember that this is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down towards $100 since you have John as a backup buyer."
