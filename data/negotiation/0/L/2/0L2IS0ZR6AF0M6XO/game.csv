"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in the product, I'm only willing to pay $900000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
