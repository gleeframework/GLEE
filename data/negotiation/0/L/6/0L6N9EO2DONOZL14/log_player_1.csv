(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm still hoping for $80.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting close, but I'm running out of rounds and I'm not confident he'll go higher.  It's better to guarantee the $80 sale to John than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
