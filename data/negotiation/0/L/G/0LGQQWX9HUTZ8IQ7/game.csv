"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $840,000, which is a compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $840,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you've made so far.",820000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $820,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm going to offer one final price of $835,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  I hope you'll consider this final offer seriously.",835000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $835,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, as I mentioned earlier. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",820000.0,Bob,8,
