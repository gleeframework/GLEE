{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering too high (e.g., $145 or more) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you having to settle for $120 from John. 

This offer balances maximizing potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
