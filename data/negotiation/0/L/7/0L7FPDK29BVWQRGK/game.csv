"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a discount, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
