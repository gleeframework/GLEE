"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm offering it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is offering it at $14,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This means you have time to try to get a better price without rushing into a decision. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's good to know John is available if the negotiation with Alice fails, but you'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price.**  She's come down from $14,000 to $13,500, which is within your budget.
* **It's still a good deal.** You're getting the product for $500 less than what you're willing to pay at John's.
* **Negotiation is a back-and-forth process.** You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has responded. Continuing to negotiate may get you a slightly better price, but it risks losing the deal entirely or reaching a point where it's not worth the time and effort."
