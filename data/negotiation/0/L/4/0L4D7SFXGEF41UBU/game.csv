"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. What do you think, Bob?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $9000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $9500, which is a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9000. Would you consider $9250? It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9250, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can do $9250, but I'd like to add a small concession. I'll throw in a premium warranty and support package, which normally costs $500. So, the total price would be $9750. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
