"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While I recognize its value,  $175 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $100 even? That would work for me.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",125.0,Alice,5,
