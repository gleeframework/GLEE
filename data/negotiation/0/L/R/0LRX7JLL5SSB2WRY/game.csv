"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,800. This is a compromise that still benefits me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,800 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,700. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",10700.0,Alice,5,
