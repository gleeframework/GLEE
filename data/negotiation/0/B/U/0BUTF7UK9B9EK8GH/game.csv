,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any room for further negotiation?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we try $1,000,000? This would be a fair compromise that respects both of our needs. It's the absolute minimum I can accept, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",980000.0,Bob,6,
