"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than your maximum price and even her own product valuation.  It makes much more sense to negotiate down from this point rather than accept such an inflated price. You can always buy from John later if the negotiation goes poorly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm more interested in a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower counter-offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** While my counter-offer is significantly lower, I want to maintain a respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation.  
* **Aiming for a Range:** My ideal price is well below $12,000. By starting at $10,000, I'm hoping to negotiate within a range that allows me to save significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still above both my target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Alice will move closer to my range before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $11,000? That would be a fair deal."",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing Towards Target:** I'm inching closer to my ideal price while still leaving some room for Alice to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** By suggesting $11,000 would be a ""fair deal,"" I'm subtly implying that I'm getting closer to walking away and potentially going with John. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly and increases the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,000. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $13,000 is her final offer.  While this is closer to my target, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $12,000. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice if I can get a better deal elsewhere."
