"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can you consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
