Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe it's worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and still allows me to get a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $95 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90. If we can agree on this price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  Selling to John for $100 would be better, but it's not worth potentially missing out on a quick sale. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
