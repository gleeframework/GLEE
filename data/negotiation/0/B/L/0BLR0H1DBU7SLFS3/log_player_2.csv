"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $1,100,000. There is room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer again. While Alice is getting closer, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for further negotiation to try and get closer to Bob's ideal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can close the gap and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your target.

This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000.

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer, $1,015,000 is still too high.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and has options (John's offer). There's still room for further negotiation to get closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However, $1,015,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $990,000. This is a fair price given the value to me, and we're so close to a deal. Let's find that final common ground."", ""product_price"": 990000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $990,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,007,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a critical point in the negotiation. He's already had 8 rounds of negotiations with Alice, and despite her concessions, the price remains above his target.  Alice is unlikely to drop significantly below $1 million. 

Since this is the 9th round, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a better deal.  It's now more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
