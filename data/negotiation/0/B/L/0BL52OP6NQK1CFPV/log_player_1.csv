Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe would be very valuable to you for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin if Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer is a starting point. If Bob negotiates, there's space to come down to a price that might still be more profitable than John's offer.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A strong initial offer can help gauge how interested Bob truly is in the product. His response will provide valuable information for further negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome for Alice."
