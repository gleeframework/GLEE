Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a good price. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's still above my minimum price, but I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000, and it's close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. There's always the risk of pushing further and getting a higher offer, but it's also possible that Bob will walk away.  It's time to secure the deal."
