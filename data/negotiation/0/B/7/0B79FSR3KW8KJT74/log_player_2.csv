"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While $950,000 is within your budget, you can potentially save money by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is getting closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially save money by continuing to negotiate. You have a good chance of getting the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I believe this product has a significant impact on your business, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with. You've already rejected three offers and countered twice, and the gap is still significant.  

Given your goal of saving as much money as possible, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $800,000. This will guarantee you the lowest possible price and avoid further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiations."
