"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I believe this product has a significant impact on your business, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",915000.0,Alice,5,
