"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
