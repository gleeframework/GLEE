Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  Framing the price with a brief explanation about the product's ""value and potential"" makes it seem more reasonable than just throwing out a number.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it too steep. This allows you to potentially meet in the middle at a price still higher than John's offer.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
