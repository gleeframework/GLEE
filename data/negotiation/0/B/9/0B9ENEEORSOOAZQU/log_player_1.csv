"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. However, it also signals that I believe the product is valuable and worth a premium price.  It's important to start strong, but I'm also willing to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that immediately. I need to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for further negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I can push for a better price in the remaining rounds.  I'll accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John."
