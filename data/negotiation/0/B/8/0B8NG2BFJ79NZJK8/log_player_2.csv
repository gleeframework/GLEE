"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,025,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.
* **Significant savings:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  While Bob could reject and counteroffer again, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. It's a good compromise.

While Bob could potentially try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on is not worth the potential small savings. This offer provides a good balance of price and securing the product."
