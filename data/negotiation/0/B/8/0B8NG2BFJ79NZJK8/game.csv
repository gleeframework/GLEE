"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
