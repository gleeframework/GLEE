"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for both of us to make a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a premium. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
