Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the potential value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which allows for a more flexible negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point.  The actual negotiation will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to pay.  I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum:** $1,050,000 is a long way from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Even though Bob's offer is lower, there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee $1,500,000, but it might be possible to achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired outcome, keeping in mind Bob's perceived value and my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,050,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Staying above minimum:** $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, giving Bob a chance to either accept or make a new counteroffer."
