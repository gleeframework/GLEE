"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, framing it as a good investment. This can help him see the potential upside.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  The threat of selling to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Floor:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum desired value ($1,000,000), it's still not enough. I need to maintain some leverage.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to take the risk for the possibility of a higher profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm making a concession by coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob that $1,050,000 is a fair price.
* **Staying Above the Minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above my minimum desired price, but it's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** My message emphasizes reaching an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and potentially leading Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, and there's still room to negotiate. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be safe, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to try to get a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 still doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing to split the difference between my last offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum desired price. 
* **Framing it as Fair:** I emphasize that $1,000,000 is a fair price, acknowledging the value of the product and the effort we've put into negotiating. 
* **Closing the Gap:** By offering my minimum desired price, I'm essentially putting the ball in Bob's court. He has to decide if he's willing to accept or walk away.
* **Encouraging a Quick Decision:** The message is direct and concise, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $975,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **No Guarantee of Success:** Even if I reject his offer and counter, there's no guarantee he'll accept. We've reached a stalemate.
* **Safe and Certain:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum desired price. It's a safe and predictable outcome, considering the limited time and risk of further negotiation. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid the potential for further negotiation that might not yield a better price."
