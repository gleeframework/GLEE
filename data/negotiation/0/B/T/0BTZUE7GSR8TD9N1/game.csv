"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and try $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the transaction.",10000.0,Bob,4,
