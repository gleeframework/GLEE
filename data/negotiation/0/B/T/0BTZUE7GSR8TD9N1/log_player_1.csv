Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $13,000.  I think you'll find this to be a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Aiming Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I'm starting significantly higher to see if I can secure a deal closer to my own valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $13,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter, and for me to potentially come down in price while still exceeding my minimum of $10,000. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have the security of John's offer ($10,000) if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above his own valuation of the product, indicating room for further negotiation.
* **Closer to My Minimum:** While $9,000 is less than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my absolute minimum of $10,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price point. I can then make a counteroffer that's still profitable but more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations forward quickly.
* **Above My Minimum:**  The $11,000 price point is still a profitable outcome for me, exceeding my $10,000 minimum.
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:**  By splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate while also seeing how much he's willing to budge. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option to walk away and accept John's $10,000 offer if Bob is unwilling to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and try $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **No Guarantee of More:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree.  He's already moved significantly from his initial offer.
* **John's Offer is Identical:** Accepting Bob's offer now gives me the same profit as selling to John. There's no financial benefit to choosing John at this point.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting the offer avoids further back-and-forth and secures the sale."
