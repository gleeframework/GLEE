Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is my initial counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.

While Bob increased his offer, it's still below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  It makes more financial sense to accept John's offer at this point."
