,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  Given the product's potential, I'm willing to pay up to $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1100000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $950000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which represents a significant compromise for me.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging our respective needs.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
