"I appreciate the offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
