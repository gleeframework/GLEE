Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,900,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product might be even more valuable than Bob initially thought.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a brief justification for the high price, emphasizing the product's potential and exclusivity. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While I don't explicitly mention John, the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more ambitious in my initial ask.

**Goal:**  My goal is to get Bob anchored on a high number. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a potentially much higher final agreement than if I started at or slightly above $1,000,000."
