Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John.

Offering the product at $120 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob wins:** He gets the product for $30 less than its value to him. 
* **You win:** You make a $40 profit, which is significantly more than John's offer.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you make a profit if he declines."
