"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for $800,000."
