"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $12,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far too high.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to $12,000 as possible.  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further as she wants to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing that he's serious about buying the product while staying within his budget.  $14,000 is a compromise, and it's possible Alice will see this as a fair price, especially since she rejected a lower offer in the previous round."
