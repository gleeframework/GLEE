"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
