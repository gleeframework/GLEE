"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $11,500? This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction.",11500.0,Alice,3,
