{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm trying to create a positive atmosphere and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid, but clearly stating my initial price point.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation.  I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $80, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:**  I'm showing that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously and am willing to negotiate.
* **Compromising:** I'm offering a price that is closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding him that even at $85, he's still getting a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and open communication style. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually agreeable price while still securing a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $80?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 matches my minimum acceptable value. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and clean sale without any further risk."
