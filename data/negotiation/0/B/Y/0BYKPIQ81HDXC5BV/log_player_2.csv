"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price. How does $120 sound?  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($120) is within your budget of $150.**
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though you could get a better deal from John in the future, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and save money immediately."
