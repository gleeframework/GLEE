Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 secures a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for John's $1,000,000."
