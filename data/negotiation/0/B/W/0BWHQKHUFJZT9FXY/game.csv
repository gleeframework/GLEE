"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
