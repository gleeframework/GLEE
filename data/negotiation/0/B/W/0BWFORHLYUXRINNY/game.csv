"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a rare opportunity and I believe it has immense value for your business. My initial asking price is $1,400,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's a difficult negotiation. While $1,250,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's not quite where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
