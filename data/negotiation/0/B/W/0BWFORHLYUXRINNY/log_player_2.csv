"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a rare opportunity and I believe it has immense value for your business. My initial asking price is $1,400,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
 
This is a good starting point.  It's unlikely Alice will accept your first counteroffer, but it's important to start the negotiation process to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's a difficult negotiation. While $1,250,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's not quite where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

You're still closer to your goal price than Alice's, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering again is the best option."
