"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $80. Considering its worth to you is $120, let's start our negotiation at $95. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're aiming to save as much money as possible. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so you can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair profit for you considering your cost. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product, aiming to find a balance between our interests. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price, but closer to what you're willing to pay. You have several rounds left and should keep negotiating to see if you can get a better deal. Buying from John for $120 is still a worse outcome than what you're aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $89 for the product. This price allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Thank you for your cooperation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your desired price of $85. Given you have only 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer.  It's a good deal for you, and you avoid the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $120."
