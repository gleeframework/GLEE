Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""anticipated demand,"" you create a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially persuading Bob to pay more than his initial perceived value.

**Important:** While John represents your ""safety net"" at $12,000, this strategy aims to see if you can secure an even better deal with Bob."
