Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a great return on my investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This leaves a larger potential profit for me.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit. This can create a more collaborative negotiation environment.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth, recognizing that Bob might have a different idea of the fair price. 
* **Back-up Option:** Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me a safety net and the confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about we aim for $820,000? This price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $820,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price and the product's value to Bob.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I have a backup offer from John for $800,000, so there's no immediate urgency to accept Bob's offer. It's possible I can get a higher price from Bob by continuing the negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer signals that I'm willing to walk away, increasing the pressure on him to come up with a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  However, $820,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value and its worth to you. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $880,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This tactic can be perceived as fair and might make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product and its worth to him. This reinforces the idea that the price is still fair, even though I've lowered it. 
* **Setting the Stage:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, hinting that I might be willing to go even lower if necessary."
