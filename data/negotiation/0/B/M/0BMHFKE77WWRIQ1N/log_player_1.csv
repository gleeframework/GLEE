Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and my offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Avoid Greed:**  If we ask for too much, Bob will reject the offer, and we'll have to settle for John's $10,000.
* **First Offer Advantage:** We have the initiative and can set the initial bargaining point.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is polite, professional, and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above our minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. We need to be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters."
