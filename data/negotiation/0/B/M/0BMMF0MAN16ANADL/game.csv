"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
