Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **My Minimum:**  I have a minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (what John is willing to pay).
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a $500,000 difference between Bob's value and my minimum.  
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,400,000 represents a compromise, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn significantly more than my minimum.

This offer is likely to be attractive to Bob as he still gets a substantial savings. It also gives me a good chance to get a high price for my product."
