"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter while also showing Bob's willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's lower than her initial offer and higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This price is still within Bob's budget and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.  There's always a chance Bob could get an even better price by continuing to negotiate, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on a deal with John is too high.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
