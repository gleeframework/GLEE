"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $110 is still too high, and you have rounds to work with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about $105? That's a $5 concession on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$105 is still more than I'm willing to pay, but it's closer. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  How about $100? That's a good compromise for both of us, and I can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 100}
