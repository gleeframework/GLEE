"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price of $1100000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $1100000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the value I believe the product offers, and it gives us both room to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the negotiation going!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1175000 for the product.

I believe this is a fair compromise and would be happy to move forward with the sale at this price.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
