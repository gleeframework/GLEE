Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a special discounted price of $14,999. I know this product will be valuable to you, and this offer is a steal compared to what others would be willing to pay."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and high value. Bob is likely to see this as a deal he doesn't want to miss. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above my $15,000 baseline."
