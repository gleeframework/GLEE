"Bob, I believe this product is a valuable asset for your company, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's significant value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my company, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. How about $1,000,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a strong profit, and it's a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
