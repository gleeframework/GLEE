"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is a valuable asset for your company, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's significant value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. How about $1,000,000? This price still leaves room for you to make a strong profit, and it's a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.
