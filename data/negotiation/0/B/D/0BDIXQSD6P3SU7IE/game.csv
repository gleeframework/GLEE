"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is the lowest I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",15000.0,Alice,7,
