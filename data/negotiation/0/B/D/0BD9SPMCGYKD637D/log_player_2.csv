"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, worth a fortune to both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This reflects its value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we can move forward.  What do you say?

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target of $800,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 825000}
