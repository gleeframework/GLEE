"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $850000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
