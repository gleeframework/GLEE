"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting point.  This tactic aims to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility. 
    * Potentially secure a much lower price if Alice is highly motivated to sell.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I aim to shift the negotiation's focal point downwards. Even if Alice rejects this offer, future counter-offers are likely to be closer to my range.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I can buy from John at $800,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I don't explicitly mention John, but it underpins my willingness to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is moving in the right direction, it's still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer aims for a compromise by suggesting the midpoint between Alice's current offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($600,000). This can signal a willingness to be reasonable while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Staying Below Max:**  The offer remains below my $800,000 limit, preserving the option to buy from John if needed.
* **Encouraging Movement:** By making a substantial move towards Alice's price, I hope to encourage her to reciprocate with a significant concession of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently made relatively small concessions. Her latest offer is only $50,000 less than her previous one, and she's emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price. This suggests she might not be willing to go much lower.
* **John's Offer is Superior:** John's offer of $800,000 is now more attractive.  While I could try to negotiate Alice down further, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that significantly beats John's. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries opportunity costs. I could be spending this time exploring other options or closing the deal with John.

It's time to take advantage of the guaranteed good deal with John."
