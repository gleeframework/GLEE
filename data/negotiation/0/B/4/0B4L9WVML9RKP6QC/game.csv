"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This price reflects my maximum budget, but I believe it's still fair considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  It's my absolute maximum, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $9800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",9800.0,Alice,5,
