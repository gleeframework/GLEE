"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it has great potential. To make this deal work, I'd be willing to offer you $850,000. I think this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my initial offer of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to bring the price down further.  It's too early to consider buying from John yet, as the negotiation with Alice may still lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise,  given my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below this point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target.  There's a good chance that Alice might be willing to come down a bit further. It's too early to buy from John because there's potential to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $887,500 is still beyond my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on it is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeatedly rejected Bob's offer of $850,000 and is stuck at $887,500. This is a clear signal that Alice is not willing to go lower, and further negotiation might be futile.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer. 

Since Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, it's now the most logical decision to buy the product from John for that price. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
