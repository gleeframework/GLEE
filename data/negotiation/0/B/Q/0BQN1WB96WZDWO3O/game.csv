"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is fair and reflects the product's potential.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product holds significant potential beyond that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point better reflects its true worth and potential for return.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above what I can afford. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
