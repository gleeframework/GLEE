Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, meaning you'll be making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's tempting:** The price is close to Bob's perceived value, making him likely to consider the offer.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and the potential risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can potentially get a better price by counteroffering.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to bridge the gap and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $13,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum price, and you are likely to get a better deal by accepting his offer rather than risking rejection or selling to John. You can always negotiate with John later if you find a better offer."
