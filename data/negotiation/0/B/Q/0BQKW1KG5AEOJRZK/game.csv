"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $80?  It's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $85 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
