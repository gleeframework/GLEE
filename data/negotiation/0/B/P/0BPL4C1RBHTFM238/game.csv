"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still leaves me with a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
