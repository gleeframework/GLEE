We're still significantly below the product's value to me and what John is offering. Let's see if I can negotiate Bob a bit higher."

Bob seems fixated on $1,250,000.  I'll hold firm for one more round to signal I'm serious about a higher price."

While it's less than my ideal price and less than what John is offering, accepting Bob's offer at $1,275,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Bob is clearly unwilling to budge further, and continuing negotiations might lead to a stalemate. Taking the sure $1,275,000 is preferable to risking getting stuck with no deal and potentially losing out on both offers."
