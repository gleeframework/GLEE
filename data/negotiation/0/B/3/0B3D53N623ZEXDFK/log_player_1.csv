Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's clear Bob values the product at $300,000 less than I do.  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly more than Bob's current offer.  

It's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 now rather than risk extended negotiations with Bob for a potentially marginal gain."
