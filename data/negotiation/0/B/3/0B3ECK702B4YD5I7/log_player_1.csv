Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your minimum price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $1,500,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable with a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to sell to John at your minimum price."
