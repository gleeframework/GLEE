Round 3

Bob is still very low. We're getting closer to John's offer, but we have room to negotiate."

We're getting close, but we're still leaving money on the table. Bob is clearly willing to move, so let's try for a higher number."

It's time to cut bait. Bob is unlikely to reach our $1,000,000 mark. It's better to take John's guaranteed offer now than risk Bob's lowballing in the remaining rounds."
