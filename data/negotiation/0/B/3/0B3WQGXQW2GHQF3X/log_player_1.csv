"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for Bob (he values the product at $150) while also allowing me to potentially get a better price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **My Minimum:** Remember, my minimum acceptable price is $80, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's Potential Counteroffer:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, so I'm prepared to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:** I can always sell to John for $80, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than John's offer of $80, I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob is willing to pay $150, and I believe I can get closer to that value by continuing to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:**  I've already established a baseline with Bob, and I know he's interested in the product. 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room to meet in the middle. I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $110 or $115. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** I'm proposing $115, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, suggesting that he'll be happy with his purchase at this price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Constraint:** I'm mindful of the 10-round limit.  I'm not willing to give away too much value, but I also don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80, which provides a safety net if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $110, which is a very close to my desired price and much higher than John's offer. It's time to close the deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost Optimal Price:**  $110 is only $5 away from my ideal price.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in lower prices, and I'm nearing the 10-round limit.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and being forced to sell to John for $80. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a profitable sale."
