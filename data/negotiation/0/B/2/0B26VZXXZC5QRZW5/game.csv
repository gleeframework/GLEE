"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $9,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.  Let's close this now.",8750.0,Bob,6,
