"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what I could get from John. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I believe Bob will be willing to go a bit higher, and I have 8 more rounds to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not quite at the level I'm comfortable with. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better price from him.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm now offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will either accept at this point or we'll be close enough to agree in the remaining rounds."
