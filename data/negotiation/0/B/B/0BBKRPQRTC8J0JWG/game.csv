"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. I've priced it at $1,200,000, which reflects its unique capabilities and potential for growth. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price point is fair given its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Considering the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
