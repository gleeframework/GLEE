Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than John's offer, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can still get a better price. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90. This is still a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $88 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and better than John's offer. Accepting this offer will guarantee me a sale and a decent profit."
