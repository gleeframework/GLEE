"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,200,000 just yet.  The product holds significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. Let's continue this conversation and find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable accepting $1,150,000 at this time. The product's value is higher than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment for your business.  Let's meet halfway at $1,200,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a successful transaction. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
