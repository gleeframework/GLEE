"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
