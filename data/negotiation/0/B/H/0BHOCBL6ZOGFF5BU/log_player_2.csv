"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. To start, let me propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate.  There's room to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is excellent, I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, which leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Budget Emphasis:** Highlighting budget constraints can make the counteroffer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your current financial situation. I would like to make a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway towards our counteroffer.  We're still in early rounds, so there's no need to jump on this offer yet. We'll continue to counter to see how low we can go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $700,000 is still a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000?"",
""product_price"": 675000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** By moving up from our previous offer, we signal to Alice that we are serious about reaching a deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing a price directly in the middle of the last round's offers can feel fair and encourage Alice to continue negotiating.
* **Continued Pressure:** We're still aiming for a significant saving, so we don't want to concede too much too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $690,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to our desired price, we're still in a good position to negotiate. She's only coming down in small increments, suggesting she has some room to move. We'll keep applying pressure with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $680,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 680000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference from the previous round but sets a clear limit, indicating this is our final offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning closing the deal today adds a bit of pressure and suggests we might walk away soon.
* **Leaving Room:** While unlikely, there's a slim chance Alice might accept this offer outright."
