"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that we both want a fair deal, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a good compromise between our previous offers.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $11,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $12,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,
