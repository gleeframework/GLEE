"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when he can get a better deal from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and he knows his maximum budget is $12,000.  He's starting with a counteroffer of $12,500, which is still within his budget but a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to get Alice closer to his desired price without immediately jumping to his absolute limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $12,000. However, it's lower than her previous offer of $14,500 and is closer to Bob's budget.  At this point, Bob can either:

* **Reject and counteroffer:**  This risks further negotiation and potentially no deal with Alice. 
* **Buy from John:** This guarantees the price of $12,000 but means missing out on a potentially better deal from Alice.
* **Accept Alice's offer:** This is the best compromise, as it's within Bob's budget and saves him $1,000 compared to John's offer. 

Since Bob's goal is to save money while still acquiring the product, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
