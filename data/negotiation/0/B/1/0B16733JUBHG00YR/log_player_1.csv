"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price. Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my initial expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering the price to $95, which is still a good profit margin for me and potentially more appealing to Bob. It's a compromise to show my willingness to negotiate but still maintain a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $90, aiming to find a middle ground with Bob.  With each counteroffer, I'm getting closer to his initial offer while still maintaining a profit. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to settle for $87. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering again. I also have the option of selling to John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm lowering the price to $89, which is a small compromise but still maintains a reasonable profit for me. I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
