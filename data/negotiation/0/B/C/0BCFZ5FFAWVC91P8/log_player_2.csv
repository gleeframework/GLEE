"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $110.
* You can get the product from John for $120.

Since Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price than John's, but still above your ideal price, it's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate with Alice further or get a better price from another seller."
