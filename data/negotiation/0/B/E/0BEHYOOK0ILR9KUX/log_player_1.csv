Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing discussions, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I place on this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet your price. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is close enough to my minimum price point and I'm willing to accept it.  I'd rather sell to Bob and close the deal now than risk losing him entirely or having to settle for the $1,500,000 offer from John."
