"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  What about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. How about we try $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
