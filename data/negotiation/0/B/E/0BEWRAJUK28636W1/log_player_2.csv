"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation. You know you have a backup option with John at $1,000,000,  so there's no need to accept an inflated price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking at something closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor low:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($800,000) anchors the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for back-and-forth negotiation while still staying under your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Confident but polite:** The message conveys your position firmly but politely, keeping the negotiation atmosphere positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down significantly, but the price is still much higher than both your limit and her own valuation of the product. It's clear there's room for further negotiation. There's no need to jump at this offer yet, especially knowing you have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant increase but within budget:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious but sets a firm upper limit within your budget. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market value"" subtly reminds Alice you're aware of the product's true worth and won't be swayed by over-inflated claims.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** The offer allows some room for Alice to counter if she's truly motivated to sell while staying within a reasonable range of your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. While I appreciate your offer of $1,100,000, I need to be closer to $1,600,000 for this deal to work for me.  This product represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to lower her price, but it's still significantly above your budget.  It's time to put more pressure on her and signal that you're willing to walk away. The next counteroffer should be our last before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is simply too far from where I'm comfortable. My final offer is $1,200,000. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This message clearly states this is your last offer, adding pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Firm but fair:** The offer is a significant increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still well below Alice's asking price and within your budget.
* **Alternative option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that you have a backup plan (John) if she doesn't accept.

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Alice accepts:**  You secure the product at a price significantly lower than her initial offer and within your budget.
2. **Alice declines:** You walk away knowing you negotiated the best possible price and can confidently purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."
