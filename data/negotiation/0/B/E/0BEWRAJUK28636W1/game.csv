"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its true worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking at something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. While I appreciate your offer of $1,100,000, I need to be closer to $1,600,000 for this deal to work for me.  This product represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is simply too far from where I'm comfortable. My final offer is $1,200,000. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to pursue other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
