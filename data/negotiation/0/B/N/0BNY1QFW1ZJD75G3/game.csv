"Alice, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is halfway between our last offers. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
