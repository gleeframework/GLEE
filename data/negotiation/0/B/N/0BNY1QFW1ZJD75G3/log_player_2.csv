"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to try and get a better price. 
* **John is an alternative:** Knowing John is willing to sell for $15,000 gives you leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your seriousness about negotiating. It's still a good profit for Alice, considering her value of $8,000.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer and still get a good price. 
* **Setting the tone:** By starting with a lower price and emphasizing a win-win scenario, you're setting the stage for a more balanced negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  $11,000 is still above your target, and you have time and leverage. 
* **Test the waters:**  You can likely get a lower price, even if it takes a few more rounds. Rejecting her offer allows you to test how far she's willing to go.
* **John is still an option:**  Knowing John will sell for $15,000 ensures that you don't need to settle for a price that's too high for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is halfway between our last offers. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise and meet her halfway.  
* **Urgency:** Mentioning a quick close adds a bit of pressure, subtly suggesting that time is running out.
* **Still within your budget:** This offer is still within your desired price range, while showing a willingness to negotiate."
