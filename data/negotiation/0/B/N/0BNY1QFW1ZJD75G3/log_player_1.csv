"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $10,000 is still too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is halfway between our last offers. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal for me considering the potential of losing more time negotiating or ending up with the lower price from John."
