"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make it worth your while. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** At $11,500, Bob is getting a significant discount from John's price ($15,000).
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'll be left with only John's higher price.  
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could potentially lead to lost opportunities. 

Accepting Alice's offer gives Bob a good deal and saves him time."
