Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum ($80).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob."
