Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the value it will bring."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000, maximizing profit means trying to get even more from Bob.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that would be leaving money on the table. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $950,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than John's offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't know if Bob has other options or how much he's willing to pay above his perceived value."
