"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $122.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to go up to $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
