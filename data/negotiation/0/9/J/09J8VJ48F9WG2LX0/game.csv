"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my valuation of the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
