"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to your organization.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm eager to discuss the details further with you.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
