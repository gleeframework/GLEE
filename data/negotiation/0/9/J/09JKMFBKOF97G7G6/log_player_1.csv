Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value it provides,"" I aim to shift Bob's focus from the price alone to the potential benefits of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to discuss the price, setting the stage for potential counteroffers.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I know I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John. Therefore, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a bit longer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's a compromise from both our previous positions. This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can facilitate a deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob rejects this counteroffer or proposes a price significantly lower, I will be ready to walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $105. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking close to his initial offer and seems unlikely to move significantly higher. His latest offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Therefore, to avoid further back-and-forth and the risk of a lower offer, it's in my best interest to accept John's guaranteed offer of $100."
