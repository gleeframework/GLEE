"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you and I believe it's an excellent value. I'm offering it to you today for $120. This is a special deal, so don't hesitate to respond if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is asking for $150. 
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $150, so $120 is a good deal. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
