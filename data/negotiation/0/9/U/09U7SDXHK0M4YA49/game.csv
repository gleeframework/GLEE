"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50",127.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $127.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",115.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,125.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $120, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $127.50, which is $121.25. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price",121.25,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the progress we're making, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go to $118. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",118.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,122.5
"I like your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $119, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to compromise at $122. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us",122.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $122 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $119, which is fair to both of us.  This would make the deal happen, and we can both move on.",119.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,123.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $119, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $121, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer",121.0,Alice,9,,
