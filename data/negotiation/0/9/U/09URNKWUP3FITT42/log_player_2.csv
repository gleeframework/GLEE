# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

While $105 is closer to your value, you can still try to get a better deal.  Let's see if you can get Alice to come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and I pay $102.50?  That way, we both save some money."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
