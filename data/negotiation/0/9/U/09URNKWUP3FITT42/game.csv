"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and I pay $102.50?  That way, we both save some money.",102.5,Bob,4,
