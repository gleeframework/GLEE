"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual maximum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is respectful while clearly indicating that the initial price is too high.
* **Target Price:** The $90 counteroffer aims for a significant discount while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice (given her product's value to her is $120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price.  There's no point in rejecting and going to another round of negotiation, especially since you can buy from John for the same price. Accepting now secures the product at your target price."
