"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob and emphasizing the deal aspect.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses.  I'll aim to gradually lower the price if necessary while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (which I can get from John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest, and I can likely get a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a fantastic value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not going all the way. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my leverage.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""good compromise"" and ""fantastic value"" to highlight the benefits for Bob.
* **Open Invitation:** I end with a friendly and encouraging message to continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm gradually lowering the price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room to push for a higher price. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and I want to leverage that.
* **Balancing Risk:** I'm comfortable risking another round of negotiation, as selling to John is always an option if I don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued interest. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($9,500). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I frame it as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency & Closure:** I add a sense of urgency by suggesting ""we can get this deal done"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh the risk of continuing negotiations versus selling to John. I'll also have to consider if I want to keep lowering the price or if it's time to call it quits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or walking away entirely.
* **Time is Money:**  We're already halfway through the allotted rounds, and I need to consider the opportunity cost of continuing negotiations.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $15,000, which is a much more secure outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd love to get a better price from Bob, the risk associated with continuing negotiations outweighs the potential reward at this point. Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum acceptable price and avoid the possibility of a deal falling through with Bob."
