"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $130. Let me know if that's a starting point for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position. I'm willing to consider $135 as a counteroffer for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering $135, which is within Bob's acceptable range.
* **Potential Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will counter with a higher price or reject his offer completely.  This could lead to a stalemate or a scenario where he's forced to buy from John at $150.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $135 is the best option for Bob, as it secures a good deal within his budget and avoids potential risks."
