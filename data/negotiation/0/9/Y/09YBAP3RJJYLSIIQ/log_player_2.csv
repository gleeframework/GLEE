"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's target value. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and he might end up paying more. Buying from John for $8,000 is also an option, but the risk is that Alice might come back with a lower price if Bob rejects this offer. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable price and avoids the potential for further negotiation."
