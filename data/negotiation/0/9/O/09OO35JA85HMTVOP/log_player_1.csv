"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $17,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 18500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit below your new offer. How about $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $18,000 is only $500 less than my counteroffer and is a good deal. I've already had three rounds of negotiation and it's important to be aware of the risk of losing the deal to John if I continue to reject offers. Accepting now is a good compromise."
