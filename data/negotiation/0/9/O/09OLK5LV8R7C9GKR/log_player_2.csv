"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down a bit, $8,200 is still closer to her initial offer than our counteroffer.  We'll keep negotiating to see if we can get a price closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we try $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

We're inching closer to Alice's price, but we're still aiming for a significant discount. This offer shows we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,400. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice increased her offer, which is a bad sign. It seems like she might be trying to anchor the price higher. We are still too far from our desired price range, so we'll continue negotiating but be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm a bit disappointed to see the price going up. I need you to understand that $7,500 is the most I'm willing to pay. If you can't match that, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

We're holding firm at our previous offer and introducing a sense of urgency. This signals that we're serious about the $7,500 price point and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down slightly, but we're still not at a price point we're happy with.  It's time to push a little harder and see if she's truly willing to meet us closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but I need to be honest - $8,100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $7,600 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different seller."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
``` 

We're making a small concession, moving up to $7,600, but clearly stating this is our final offer. By introducing the possibility of going with another seller, we're increasing the pressure and emphasizing the need for Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your final offer is $7,600, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $8,050. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away.  Alice has barely budged from her last offer, and we're only $950 away from John's price. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice not budging further and losing the opportunity to buy from John."
