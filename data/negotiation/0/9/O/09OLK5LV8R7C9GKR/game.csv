"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we try $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,400. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm a bit disappointed to see the price going up. I need you to understand that $7,500 is the most I'm willing to pay. If you can't match that, I might have to consider other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but I need to be honest - $8,100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $7,600 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different seller.",7600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your final offer is $7,600, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $8,050. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8050.0,Alice,9,
