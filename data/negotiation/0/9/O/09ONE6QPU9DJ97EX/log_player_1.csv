Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchor Price:**  By offering a price of $120, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a precedent.
* **Leave Room for Counteroffer:**  Bob is likely to negotiate. Starting high allows you to potentially meet in the middle while still making a significant profit. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage. You can be more firm in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. The optimal opening offer can depend on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
