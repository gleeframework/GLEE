Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000, which is the price John is willing to sell it to me for. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,350,000 as my new offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's holding firm at $1,400,000, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's time to secure the deal with John for $1,500,000."
