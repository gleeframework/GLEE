"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant price for Bob, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum threshold of $8,000. It's a strong opening offer that shows I'm serious about selling, but also leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise while still leaving some profit margin.  It's a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe we can still negotiate a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,900. This is a small decrease from my previous offer but still puts me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to pay and I can still maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult.  Selling to John would yield less profit. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
