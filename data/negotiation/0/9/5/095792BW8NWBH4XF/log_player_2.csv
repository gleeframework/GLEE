Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us, $875,000 is unfortunately a little lower than I can go at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  It's a small adjustment, but it would help me to bridge the gap between our current positions.  Let's see if we can make this happen!
