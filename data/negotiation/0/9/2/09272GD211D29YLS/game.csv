"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product brings, I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. How about we split the difference and agree on $1050000?  I'm confident this price is fair and will allow you to maximize your potential returns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and still reflects the value I believe the product will bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the unique value this product brings to your business, I'm confident it will quickly generate a significant return on your investment.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $975000.  This price allows you to get a great deal while ensuring I'm able to meet my own financial needs.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. While I appreciate your offer, $925000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about we meet at $950000? This price allows you to secure a powerful tool for your company while ensuring I can move forward with my own projects. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
