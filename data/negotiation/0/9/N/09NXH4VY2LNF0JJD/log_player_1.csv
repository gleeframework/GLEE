"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $8,250. I'm still thinking $7,500 is a fair price. Can you meet me in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's less hassle than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
