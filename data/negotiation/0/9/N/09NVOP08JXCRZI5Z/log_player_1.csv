Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it still gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $105?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop below $110 at this point. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a good compromise. Let's make a deal at this price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
