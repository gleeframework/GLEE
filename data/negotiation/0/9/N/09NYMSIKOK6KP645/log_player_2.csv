"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $200. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $130 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. I'm aiming for a quick deal, but leaving some room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $165 is still above my maximum budget of $150. While it's closer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  John is offering the product at my price point, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything over $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about $145? That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than my ideal $150 to demonstrate a willingness to compromise, but still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product while staying within my budget."
