# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

While $110 is a good price, you can get it for $120 from John.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John allows you to achieve that goal."
