"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to you. A price of $140 is too high, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$135 is a good price considering your value of the product and Alice's willingness to negotiate.  Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
