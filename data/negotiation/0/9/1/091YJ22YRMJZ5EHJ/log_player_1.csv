Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the value, you might sway Bob towards accepting even if the price is higher than his perceived value. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, it's essential to gauge Bob's reactions and be prepared to potentially lower the price during negotiations if he seems hesitant."
