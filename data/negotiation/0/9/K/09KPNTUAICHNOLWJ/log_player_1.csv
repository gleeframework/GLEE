Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $100. I believe it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he counter-offers, it means he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100 gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget though.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value ($80).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his initial low offer, you signal that you're looking for a fairer deal. You'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to find a compromise that feels fair to both parties. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $85 is still slightly above what Bob values the product at ($80), giving you some bargaining power. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer leaves space for Bob to potentially counter again, while still staying within a range that's profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $85 is closer, but still a little too steep for me.  Could you do $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer!  While $70 is better than his initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  It seems Bob is willing to move closer to your range.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for another round where you can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see you're serious about this. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?  That's a very fair offer."",
""product_price"": 77.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate that you are willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $77.50 is still a profitable price for you, though getting close to your bottom line. 
* **Final Offer Tone:**  The phrasing ""split the difference"" and ""very fair offer"" suggests that this is your final concession, encouraging Bob to accept."
