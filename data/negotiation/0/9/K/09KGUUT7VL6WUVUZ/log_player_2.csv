"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product for a price that I'm confident we can agree on. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000 and is a better price than what John is offering. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures Bob gets the product."
