"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it at $12,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,500 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I believe this still reflects the true value of the product and could be a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better for Bob to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. While he could buy from John for $8,000, there's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
