Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. If you want to increase the chance of him accepting, you could offer a slightly lower price. However, this strategy aims to get you the highest possible return."
