Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my highest value for the product. Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept anything less. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to push for a bit closer to my target.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see where it goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but it's still closer to my target price than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $925,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum desired price.  It's not worth risking the potential of further negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to go with the safe option and sell to John."
