"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To show my interest, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $875,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. He has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a solid fallback option with John. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product and my willingness to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm going to meet you at $850,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is now within Bob's budget and is a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially increasing her counter-offer.  Furthermore, there's a risk that Bob could run out of rounds and be forced to purchase from John for a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids unnecessary risk."
