Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if we can get a better price."

This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still above my personal maximum.  I'm hoping this will start the negotiation and we can find a price we both agree on."

I'm going to offer $9,000. This is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.  I'm hoping this is close enough to where we can reach a deal."

I'm going to offer $10,000. This is getting closer to my limit, but it's still a considerable amount lower than Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept."

Alice's offer is still above my limit, and we've been going back and forth for a while. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. It's not the best price, but it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
