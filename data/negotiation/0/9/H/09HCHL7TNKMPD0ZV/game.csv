"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
