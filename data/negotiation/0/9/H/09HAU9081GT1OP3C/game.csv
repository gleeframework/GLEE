"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about $110?  I'm really looking for a good deal.",110.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can do $130, though. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. Let's split the difference and make this happen.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135, as I've already compromised a bit by coming down to $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,,
