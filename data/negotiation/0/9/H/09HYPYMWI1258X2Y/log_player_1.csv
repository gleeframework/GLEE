Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's lower than my minimum desired price but higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **It shows flexibility:** I'm not starting at my absolute bottom line, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and using a friendly tone.

This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further if he's not willing to pay my asking price.  I'm also prepared to walk away if he's too far off from my desired price, as I have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try to get closer to my target price, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer right now.  

I'm also confident that I can get a better price from Bob in the next round of negotiations.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum desired price. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't accept a price that is significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you acknowledging the value of my product.  While I understand your position, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for some flexibility on my end. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Remain firm:**  The price is still above Bob's initial offer, showing I'm not desperate to sell at a drastically lower price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.

This approach gives Bob the opportunity to accept a slightly higher price while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It also positions me to potentially move higher if needed in the next round."
