"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation and signals that I perceive the product's value to be very high. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand how eager he is to acquire the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option to sell to John for my minimum price provides a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message indicates he's willing to ""meet in the middle,"" suggesting he might go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've lowered my price by $200,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. This substantial drop aims to encourage him to increase his offer significantly. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,800,000 price point is still comfortably above my minimum and leaves space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,800,000 is still a bit rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,700,000 is a significant amount above my minimum price of $1,500,000, representing a substantial profit.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's message suggests he's nearing his maximum price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to smaller concessions or risk him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation delays receiving payment and incurs opportunity costs. Accepting now secures a good deal."
