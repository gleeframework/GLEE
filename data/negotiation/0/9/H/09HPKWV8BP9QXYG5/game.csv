"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,800,000 is still a bit rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider meeting me at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
