Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Ideally, I want to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Since Bob values the product at $8,000, I know I can't go much higher than that.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 acts as a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive in my negotiation with Bob. 
* **The Offer:** $12,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for potential negotiation and is attractive enough for Bob to consider.

**Outcome:** 
* If Bob accepts, I earn $12,000.
* If Bob rejects, I sell to John and earn $15,000.

This approach balances the risk of losing the sale to Bob with the potential for a higher price."
