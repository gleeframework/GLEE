"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I can meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I could make this work at $1,000,000. That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
