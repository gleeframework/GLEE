"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's start from here.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground - how about $2,000,000? This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This reflects a compromise that benefits both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I see we're both trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you given your valuation.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
