Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I can do $130, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made a significant concession, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to sell to John and secure a price that meets my minimum requirement."
