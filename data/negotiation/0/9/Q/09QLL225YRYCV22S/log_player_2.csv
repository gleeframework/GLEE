You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer.  He wants to save as much money as possible, and $850,000 is more than his maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This price is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
