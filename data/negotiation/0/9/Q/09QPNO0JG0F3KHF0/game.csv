"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you've stated. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its worth and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,000,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,700,000? This recognizes its true worth while still making it a beneficial acquisition for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
