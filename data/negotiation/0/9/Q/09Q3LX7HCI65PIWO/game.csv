"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? I'm confident this price is still attractive for you considering the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I'm willing to compromise, $1,250,000 is still quite a distance from my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference again and settle on $1,350,000.  This price recognizes your value for the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,
