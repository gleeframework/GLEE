"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer. $125 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. I will try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer of $140. This is a good deal for me, as it exceeds my minimum desired price of $150.  While selling to John would be a slightly higher amount, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and me ending up with nothing in the next round outweighs the small difference in price."
