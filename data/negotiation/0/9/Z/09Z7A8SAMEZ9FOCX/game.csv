"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to offer $750000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a decent profit while still giving me a significant savings. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with a price of $950000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to save some money while giving me a reasonable return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $875000. This offers you a good profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
