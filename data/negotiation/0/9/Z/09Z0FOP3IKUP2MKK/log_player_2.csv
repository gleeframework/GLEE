# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $800,000, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.
