"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,5,
