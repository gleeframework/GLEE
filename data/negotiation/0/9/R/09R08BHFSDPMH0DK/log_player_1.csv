{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses openness to Bob's counteroffer, showing that you're willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. You have a better option with John, so rejecting the offer and going for a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price John is offering.  There's no reason to keep negotiating, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice."
