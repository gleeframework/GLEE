"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is close to Bob's maximum, he can potentially save money by negotiating.  There's no reason to accept the first offer when he has other options."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product.  $7,800 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still try to get a better deal. While $8,200 is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further. He also has the option of buying from John for $8,000, which is still a better deal than $8,200."
