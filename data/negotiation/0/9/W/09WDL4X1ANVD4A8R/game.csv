"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I like the direction we're heading, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
