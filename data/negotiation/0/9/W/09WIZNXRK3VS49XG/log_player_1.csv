"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I can likely get closer to my desired amount with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

I'm slightly lowering my previous offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. This should keep the deal moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway in this round. By matching his last offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit above my minimum. This should encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept just yet.  There's a chance I can still get a better offer from Bob or, in a worst case scenario, sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1385000} 
```

I'm  lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a price that's above Bob's previous offer.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I want to ensure a deal is made.  This counteroffer should encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are not progressing as quickly as I'd hoped.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident I can secure a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John and secure the sale."
