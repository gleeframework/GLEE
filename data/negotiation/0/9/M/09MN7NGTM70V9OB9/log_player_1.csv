"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1,700,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a far cry from my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob.  My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, and I have 10 rounds to work with.  I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my original offer. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can get him closer to that price without having to sell to John. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to $1,100,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer significantly, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm determined to get at least $1,500,000 for this product.  I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still convince Bob to increase his offer or sell to John. I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my desired price. However, $1,000,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the unique value of this product.  Let's close this deal now and make it mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
