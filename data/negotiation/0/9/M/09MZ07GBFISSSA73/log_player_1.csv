Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is designed to maximize my profit while still being appealing to Bob.  Here's the reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000 (John's offer)
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $15,000
* **Offer at $14,000:** This leaves $1,000 for me over my minimum and $1,000 for Bob over his minimum (which is likely the lowest price he'd be willing to accept).

This strategy aims to find a compromise that allows me to get a higher price than John's offer while still keeping Bob interested."
