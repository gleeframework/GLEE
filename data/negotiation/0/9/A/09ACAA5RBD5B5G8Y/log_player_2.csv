Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for Alice to come down further, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
