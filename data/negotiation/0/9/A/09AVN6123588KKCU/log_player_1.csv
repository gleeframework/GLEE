Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this is a good starting point to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like a bit more,  $13,500 is a good price considering I know Bob is willing to pay more than John.  I'm prioritizing closing the deal and securing a decent profit."
