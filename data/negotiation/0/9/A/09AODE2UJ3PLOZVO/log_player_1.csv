Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is tempting, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and continuing the negotiation risks losing both offers. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice in this scenario."
