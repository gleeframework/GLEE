"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $14,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we are getting closer. How about we settle at $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
