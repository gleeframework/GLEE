"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer. How about $10500?  This price would be fair for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale.",10250.0,Bob,4,
