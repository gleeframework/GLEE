Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation or for Bob to accept the offer outright. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  Alice creates a sense of urgency and value perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, and the question ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he wants.

While Alice knows John will buy the product for $150, there's a chance Bob might pay more, maximizing Alice's profit."
