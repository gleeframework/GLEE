"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while acknowledging Bob's higher valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, acknowledging that Bob's offer was lower than my initial ask. This counteroffer represents a compromise while still allowing for some potential profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price point, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
