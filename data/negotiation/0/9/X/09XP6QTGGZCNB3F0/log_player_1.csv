Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might be willing to pay a little more than $1,100,000. This allows for a potential win-win situation where you earn more than your minimum and Bob gets the product at a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than selling to John for $800,000, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's more in line with his potential willingness to pay a bit more than $900,000.  This counteroffer helps move the negotiation forward while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  There's a chance we could continue negotiating and maybe get a bit closer to $1,000,000, but the risk of Bob walking away and me being left with John's offer is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids further delays."
