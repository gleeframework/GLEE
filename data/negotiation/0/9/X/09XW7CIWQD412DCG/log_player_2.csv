Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $825,000 represents a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price. Further haggling risks pushing Alice away and forcing me to buy from John at a much higher cost."
