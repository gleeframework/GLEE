"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point. Could we consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
