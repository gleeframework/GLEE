"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to go down to $9,800. This is my final offer.  I'm confident that this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,600, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9600.0,Bob,6,
