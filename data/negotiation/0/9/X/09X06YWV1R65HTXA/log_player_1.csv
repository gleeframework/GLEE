Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $13,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."

This price is still fair considering the value to you and allows for a reasonable margin for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
