"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $14,000? This price is still fair considering the value to you and allows for a reasonable margin for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",12500.0,Bob,4,
