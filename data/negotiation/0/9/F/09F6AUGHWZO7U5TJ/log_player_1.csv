Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows that I value the product and am confident in its worth."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,500 is a good price, above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and only slightly lower than my last offer.  It seems like a good deal that I can take."
