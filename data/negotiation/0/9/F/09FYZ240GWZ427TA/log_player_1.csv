Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves you space to potentially negotiate down to $13,000 with Bob, still making a profit over selling to John.
* **Urgency:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to make a decision faster.

This strategy aims to balance getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk that he might reject the offer."
