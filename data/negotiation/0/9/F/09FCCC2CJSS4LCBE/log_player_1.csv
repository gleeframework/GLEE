Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring we get a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The message subtly reminds Bob that we have a backup offer, creating a sense of urgency and value.
* **Respecting the Bottom Line:** We don't want to go below our $800,000 minimum, ensuring a profitable deal regardless."
