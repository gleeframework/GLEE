"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $975,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum and still a good deal for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and effort in finding a solution. While $960,000 is closer, I'm still a bit far from my target price. To bridge the gap, how about $970,000?
