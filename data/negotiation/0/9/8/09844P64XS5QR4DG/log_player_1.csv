Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a significant profit, but also want to leave room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his perceived value of the product.  I'll also keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a drastic reduction from my initial offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but is a considerable reduction from my initial price. I'm hoping this shows good faith in continuing the negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can push the price higher. Selling to John would guarantee me a decent profit, but I'm not yet convinced I can't get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping it well above Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not going to give it away.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still not quite enough to make me happy. At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further. To avoid potentially losing more time and money, I'm going to accept the guaranteed offer from John.  This will ensure a profitable sale and save me from any further potential losses."
