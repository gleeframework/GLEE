"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum price ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will give me clues about his price sensitivity and negotiating style. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $16,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. By rejecting, I signal that I believe the product is worth more. We're only in round 2, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me right now. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've come down $1,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I haven't dropped too much, reinforcing that the product is valuable. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting $15,000 as a ""middle ground"" aims to make Bob feel like we're working towards a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider $14,500 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $14,500 is a significant profit above my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has incrementally increased his offer, suggesting he's serious about buying. Continuing to push might make him walk away. 
* **Time Value:**  We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of a stalemate later on."
