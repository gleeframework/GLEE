Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100, and I'm not sure if we can reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum price."
