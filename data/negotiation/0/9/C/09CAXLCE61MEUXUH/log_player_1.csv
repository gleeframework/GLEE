Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $887,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems anchored at $875,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
