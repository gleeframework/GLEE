This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes more sense than potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice for a minimal price difference."
