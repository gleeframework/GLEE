"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can get from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's try to find a middle ground, what do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
