Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than what I originally wanted to sell the product for, and it's still within a range I'm comfortable with.  It's better to accept his offer and avoid the risk of a long negotiation or potentially losing the deal with John."
