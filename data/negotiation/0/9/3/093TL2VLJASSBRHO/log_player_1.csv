"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider it. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I've left room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is showing interest, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, guaranteeing my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm reducing my price to $100, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great price"" to incentivize Bob.
* **Room for compromise:** I'm still above Bob's offer, leaving room for potential further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a sale with John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle at $97.50.  That way, we both get a good deal and can close this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by proposing a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Urgency:**  I'm mentioning closing the deal quickly to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Still above my minimum:**  While $97.50 is closer to my minimum, it's still above my minimum price of $120, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a sale with John at $120.
* **Focus on maximizing profit:** I am prioritizing maximizing my profit and am not pressured to close the deal quickly at a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $92.50 is still a bit low.  Let's split the difference and go with $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.  "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm presenting the offer as a fair price for both of us, highlighting the benefits of finalizing the deal.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $120, but it's becoming increasingly close to my minimum.  I need to decide if I'm willing to accept a lower price to close the deal or keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92.50, so I'll offer $92 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and there are only two rounds left.  There is a high likelihood that Bob will continue to offer prices lower than my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is more than what I'd earn if I accepted Bob's offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  I don't want to risk losing more time on a negotiation that might not result in a profitable deal.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  selling to John at $120 is the most sensible decision given the current situation."
