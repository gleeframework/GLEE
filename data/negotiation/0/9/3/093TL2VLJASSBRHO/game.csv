,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great price for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle at $97.50.  That way, we both get a good deal and can close this deal quickly. ",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $92.50 is still a bit low.  Let's split the difference and go with $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.  ",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92.50, so I'll offer $92 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.0,Bob,8,
