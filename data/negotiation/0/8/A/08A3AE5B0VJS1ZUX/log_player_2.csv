{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While $950,000 is still a significant amount, it's $50,000 less than what John is selling it for. 
* **You're still within your budget:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and you're paying $950,000. This means you're getting a good deal and staying within your financial limitations."
