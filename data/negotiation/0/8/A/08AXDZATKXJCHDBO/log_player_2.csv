"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Your value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice is selling it for $100.
* **John's price:** John is selling it for $120.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice, the offer is already within your acceptable price range."
