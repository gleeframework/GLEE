"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's too risky to accept the offer without exploring negotiation options. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800,000 to make it work. This is a fair starting point, given the product's potential and my willingness to finalize a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I believe it's a reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is exactly my maximum budget. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for further negotiation. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at the same price."
