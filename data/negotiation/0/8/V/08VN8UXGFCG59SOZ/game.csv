"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and market demand. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800000 to make it work. This is a fair starting point, given the product's potential and my willingness to finalize a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I believe it's a reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
