"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial offer of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this still reflects the true value of what this product can do for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is cutting it too close. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I truly value the product, but my budget constraints remain firm. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,160,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a satisfactory agreement.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
