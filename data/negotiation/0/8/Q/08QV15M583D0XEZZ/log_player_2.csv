(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth negotiating further to see if he can get closer to his $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals his willingness to negotiate. He's aiming for a price closer to his budget without being overly aggressive."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer.  Bob is still trying to get closer to his target price of $800,000. He should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a better price.  While buying from John is always an option, there's still a possibility of getting a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. He's still aiming for a price closer to his budget, but showing flexibility to reach a deal.  This middle-ground offer could encourage Alice to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her initial price, and it is getting unlikely that she will come down to a price that Bob is willing to accept. There are only five rounds left and the risk of not getting the product at all is increasing.  It is a better strategy for Bob to purchase the product from John at his guaranteed price of $800,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
