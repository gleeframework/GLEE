{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for further negotiation.  I'm confident that I can still get a good deal while staying within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my desired price point.  I believe I can continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try again for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

However, I'm still trying to get a price closer to my target.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and this offer demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
