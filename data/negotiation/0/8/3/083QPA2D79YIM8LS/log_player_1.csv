"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down if needed.  However, I'm confident that I can achieve a higher price than John's $10,000 offer, especially as I have 10 rounds to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get more. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price and John's offer. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept it. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm now offering the product for $10,000, which is the same as John's offer. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
