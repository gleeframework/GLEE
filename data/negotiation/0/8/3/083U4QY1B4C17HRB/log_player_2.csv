"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can potentially get a better price by rejecting it, hoping she'll come down. If she doesn't, you're still willing to buy from John for $150."
