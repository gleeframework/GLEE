Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate,  increasing the chance of a sale.
* **Backup Offer:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so there's no pressure to go below that price. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, we increase the chances of making a profitable deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
