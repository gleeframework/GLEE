"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  While I agree it's a good product, $1,050,000 is still a bit rich for me. How about we settle at $975,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'll meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this price.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
