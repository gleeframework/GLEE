"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to respond, making it clear the negotiation is ongoing. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  
* If negotiations stall, I'll be ready to switch to John and secure the $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, there's still room to negotiate. I can make a counteroffer that's more appealing to me.
* **No need to sell to John yet:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I might be able to get a higher price through further negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,600,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've secured a good deal.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if further negotiation is worthwhile or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for improvement:** There's still a small margin for negotiation, and I might be able to push for a price closer to $1,500,000.
* **John is a backup:** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not desperate enough to settle for it yet.  I have John as a backup, and I'm confident I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll carefully consider selling to John if the next round doesn't yield a satisfactory result."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to ensure he doesn't undervalue it. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and friendly, hoping to keep the negotiation productive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a decent deal.
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider selling to John in the next round.  If Bob counters with something close to my offer, I might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and with each round, the potential for a good deal for me is decreasing.
* **John is still a viable option:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is still a good deal, and I'm not convinced Bob will come up to my price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make one more counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price close to my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell the product to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's settle on $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's value and would be a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making my final counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement but sticking close to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly mentioning the time pressure, suggesting that if he doesn't accept, I'll move on.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent deal, though not my ideal outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John in the next round. The risk of not getting a deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $1,300,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate.
* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, and there's little chance Bob will increase his offer significantly.
* **John is a safe bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a good deal and protects me from further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
