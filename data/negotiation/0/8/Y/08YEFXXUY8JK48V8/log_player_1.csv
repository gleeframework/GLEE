Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm not giving away all the details about the product, which could pique Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll also be keeping an eye on the clock to see how long the negotiation takes.  If it drags on or doesn't seem to be going anywhere, I can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $12,000 is still below the value I've placed on the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price. There's room to negotiate further, especially since Bob seems interested.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my original asking price, but a bit lower than $15,000.  I want to show I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $12,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This allows for a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Fair Value:** $13,500 represents a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation fair and potentially leads to a quick resolution.
* **Incentive for Bob:**  The counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, giving him a reason to consider it and move the negotiation forward.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, the negotiation ends. 
* **Further Negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or switch to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $13,000 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm not getting my ideal price, Bob seems serious about making a deal. This gives me some leverage in potential future negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Close:** I will accept Bob's offer and secure a sale.  
* **Future Considerations:** I will keep Bob's contact information in case I have similar products to sell in the future."
