Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it allows for potential negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** A high initial offer establishes a strong starting position for negotiation and gives me more room to compromise later. 
* **Unknown Value:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to start high and gauge his reaction.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away and still secure a decent price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response (accept, reject, or counteroffer) and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still far below my desired starting point. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, aiming to close the gap.

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's initial counteroffer suggests he is willing to pay more than my minimum value, but it's still too low. There's room for negotiation to get closer to my target price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **John is Still an Option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial asking price, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,300,000 represents a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $1,100,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Protecting My Value:** This counteroffer still keeps my profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I will need to consider adjusting my offer further or possibly selling to John to avoid a lengthy negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what John is willing to pay.  The negotiation has reached a point where further rounds are unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Profit Margin:**  The potential profit margin of $50,000 is not worth the risk of further negotiation.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could consume valuable time, and John is a reliable buyer who will pay a guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction, minimizing potential loss and maximizing my time.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept John's offer to sell the product for $1,000,000, ensuring a quick and reliable sale."
