Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $887,500.  This way, we both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
