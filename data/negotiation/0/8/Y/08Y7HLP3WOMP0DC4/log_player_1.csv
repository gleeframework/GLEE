{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing Alice's potential earnings. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive deliberation. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum acceptable price."
