"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $90.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$87.50 is a good price for you, as it is still below your $100 limit. There is no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and buying from John is more expensive."
