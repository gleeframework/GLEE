Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to its value to me.  I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds for me, while also allowing for a profitable margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to secure the product at a lower price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
