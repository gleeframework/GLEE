Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price than John's offer of $150, but I'm ready to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not comfortable with his initial offer, I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $160 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum threshold and a better deal than selling to John. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
