"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept $800,000, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round where I can counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit more, to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility, but still keeps the price within a reasonable range for me. Hopefully, this will motivate Bob to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still too low for me. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating. I'm going to reject his offer and continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I still have room to negotiate.  If he's serious about buying the product, I believe he'll come up to a price closer to my minimum acceptable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm only two rounds away from my guaranteed sale to John.  I'm going to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the final two rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,075,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still willing to negotiate.  We're getting very close, and I'm hoping this will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm only one round away from selling to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000.  The risk of not getting a better offer from Bob outweighs the potential gain of an extra $25,000.  I'll take the safe bet and sell to John."
