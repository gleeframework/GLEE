"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still offers you a great value. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, and I am willing to increase my offer to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm coming down from my price and you're going up from yours. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
