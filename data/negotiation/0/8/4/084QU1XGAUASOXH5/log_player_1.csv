Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100.  This is my absolute minimum price, as I can always sell to John for the same amount.  I hope Bob will accept this offer, as it's fair considering the value of the product."
