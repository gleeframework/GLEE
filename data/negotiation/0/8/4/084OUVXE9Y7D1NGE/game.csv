"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true worth.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
