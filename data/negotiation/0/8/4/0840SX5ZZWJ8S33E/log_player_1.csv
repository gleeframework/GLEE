{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** By offering $11,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still getting a price closer to my minimum.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting with a very high price could make Bob walk away immediately. This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is brief and straightforward, focusing on the offer and leaving room for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal or sell to John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to lower my price to $10,500, which is still above Bob's offer but significantly closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize that $10,500 is still a fair price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a little high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting his offer would allow me to sell the product quickly and avoid any further negotiation.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be more profitable, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and saves me the time and effort of additional negotiation."
