"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
