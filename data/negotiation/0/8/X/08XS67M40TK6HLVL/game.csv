"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value this product brings. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true potential while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my limit. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  To that end, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the value you'll receive will far exceed the price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
