"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still not quite there. Let's try $85.  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk Alice rejecting further offers and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
