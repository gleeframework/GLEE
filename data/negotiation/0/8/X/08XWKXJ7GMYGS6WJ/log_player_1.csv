{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $75? That's a pretty good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still not quite there. Let's try $85.  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
