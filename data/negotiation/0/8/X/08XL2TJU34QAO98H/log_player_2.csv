"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $12,000. This is a one-time offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent offer, you know you have a fallback option with John at $15,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her perceived value of $8,000."
