Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
