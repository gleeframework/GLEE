"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a significant way off from what I believe is fair value for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which represents a fair compromise. This price allows for a good profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
