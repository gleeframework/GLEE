{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, considering my minimum is $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $100?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling $115 is a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $115 is close to my minimum, I'm going to keep pushing for a slightly higher price. I still have rounds left, and I think I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
