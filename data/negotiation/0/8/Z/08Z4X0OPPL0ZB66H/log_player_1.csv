Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is closer to my ideal price than to John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for counteroffers and a potential mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still potentially get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk that Bob will walk away, but I believe the potential gains from a higher price outweigh the risk.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his willingness to pay and my own desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,300,000, which is a compromise between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it benefits him, making him more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Setting a Deadline:** I'm implicitly setting a deadline by stating I'm willing to compromise. This creates urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.

**Overall, this counter-offer aims to secure a better price than Bob's initial offer while keeping negotiations open and potentially leading to a successful deal.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There's a real risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer again. He's already shown some flexibility, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000.

**Overall, it's a calculated risk.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a decent profit, minimizing the chance of losing the deal entirely.**"
