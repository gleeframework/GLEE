"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $120. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a fair price of $140. This offer includes not only the product itself but also access to exclusive customer support and future updates. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the $140 offer is the most strategically sound option:

* **Saves money:**  You save $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Avoids risk:** There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and rejecting her offer means you *have* to buy from John at $150. 

Getting the product for $10 under your maximum budget is a good deal."
