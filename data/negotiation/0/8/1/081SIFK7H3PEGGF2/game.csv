"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1750000, recognizing the potential value this product can bring to your operations. This price reflects a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
