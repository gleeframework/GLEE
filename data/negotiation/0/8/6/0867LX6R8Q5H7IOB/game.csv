"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more to me than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? I'm serious about acquiring this product and believe this price is fair considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
