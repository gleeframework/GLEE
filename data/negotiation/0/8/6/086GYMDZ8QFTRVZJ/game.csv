"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering and finding a middle ground is important to me. However, the value of this product to me, and its potential for you, is much higher. Let's land somewhere in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $950,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
