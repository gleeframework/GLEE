"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
