"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get it for even less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to buy the product.  At $11,500, he's getting a significant discount from the price John would charge ($15,000) and also from Alice's initial offer ($12,000). There's a risk that Alice might refuse a counteroffer and Bob might end up paying John's higher price, so accepting this offer is the safest and most logical choice."
