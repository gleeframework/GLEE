"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
