"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",11750.0,Alice,5,
