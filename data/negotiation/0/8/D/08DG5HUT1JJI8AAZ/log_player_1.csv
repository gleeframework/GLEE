"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $950,000 is a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,100,000. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a significant profit for you and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a substantial profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's a significant profit for me, and accepting this offer ensures I don't risk losing the deal entirely to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob for a lower price."
