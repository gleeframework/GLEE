{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, signaling my seriousness about negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a decent improvement, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a lower price and have already demonstrated my willingness to negotiate. Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a small increase from my previous one, showing that I am serious about making a deal, but still keeping the price lower than Alice's. Stating it as my final offer creates pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $1320000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her previous offer, and is only $20,000 more than my last counteroffer.  This means I'm close to my target price, and any further negotiation may risk the deal falling through. It's best to accept this offer, as the potential savings are minor compared to the risk of losing the deal."
