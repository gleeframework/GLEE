"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000.  This is my best offer, let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this product in your hands.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value. However, $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
