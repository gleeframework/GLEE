"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Building Interest:** I'm framing the product as valuable and unique to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation strong, gauge Bob's interest, and set the stage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm not in a rush and want to try to get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000 to close this deal. It's still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe the product's value justifies it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows good faith while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm implying that I'm ready to close the deal, putting pressure on Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point. While I would ideally get closer to $12,000,  accepting his offer of $11,500 is a good outcome considering the limited rounds remaining.  It's a reasonable price and a good compromise."
