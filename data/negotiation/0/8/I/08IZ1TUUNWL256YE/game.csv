,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,225,000 is the sweet spot. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,225,000, so I'll offer $1,162,500. This is my final offer.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
