"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $14,500 is fair. What are your thoughts?",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This offer reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. How about we try $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it.  Would you consider $11,750? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, so how about $11,375? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11375.0,Bob,6,
