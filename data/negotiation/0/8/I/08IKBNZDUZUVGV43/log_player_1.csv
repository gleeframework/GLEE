Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the features of the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. If that works for you, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
