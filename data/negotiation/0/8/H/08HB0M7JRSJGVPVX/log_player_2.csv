"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse and you'd end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John. Accepting the current offer guarantees a significant saving."
