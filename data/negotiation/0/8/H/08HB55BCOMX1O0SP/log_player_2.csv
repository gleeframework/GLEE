"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $100 is a good starting point, but you want to try and negotiate lower.
* It's too early to buy from John at $150, as you haven't exhausted the negotiation with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price.
* This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down in price.
* It's still within my budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is a slight improvement from her initial offer, but still not as low as my desired price.
* There are still rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not willing to settle for this price yet. 
* It's still too early to buy from John as I'm confident I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but is still a bit high. 
* My counteroffer of $80 is a compromise, showing I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a good deal. 
* This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but also shows Alice I'm moving closer to her price."
