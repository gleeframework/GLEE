"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000.  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That would be a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about making this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
