"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a little too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $135?  That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $132 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $134, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this product will be worth it for you, and I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity to work with you.",134.0,Alice,5,,
