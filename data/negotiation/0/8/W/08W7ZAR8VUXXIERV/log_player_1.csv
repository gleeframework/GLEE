Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  Considering your final offer, I could go up to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, as I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob has reached his absolute limit and is unlikely to budge. Accepting his offer of $1,000,000 is the best decision at this point to secure a deal.  It's a significant amount, and prolonging negotiations further might not yield a better outcome."
