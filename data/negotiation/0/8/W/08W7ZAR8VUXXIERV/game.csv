"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise reflecting the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. To be frank, I have other options for acquiring a similar product. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand you have other options, but I believe this product offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  Considering your final offer, I could go up to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute limit, as I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
