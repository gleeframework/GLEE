"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I can do $900,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant concession. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  If you're willing to move to $1,200,000, we have a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
