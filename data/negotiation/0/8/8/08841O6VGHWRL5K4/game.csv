"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I know it holds even greater value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1250000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1100000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents great value for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1125000. Can you consider that?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility. I'm willing to come down to $1135000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. It's a substantial amount for you, and still allows me to achieve a reasonable return. Let's close this deal!",1135000.0,Alice,5,
