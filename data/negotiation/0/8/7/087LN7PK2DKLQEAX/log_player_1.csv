Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering it at $12,000 or more to Bob is unlikely to get a sale. We need a price that's attractive to Bob but still profitable for you.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 offers a significant saving to Bob compared to your guaranteed price, making it more enticing for him to accept. Meanwhile, you still secure a $1,500 profit if he accepts."
