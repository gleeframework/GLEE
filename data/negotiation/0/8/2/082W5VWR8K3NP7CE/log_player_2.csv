Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Let's see if Alice is willing to meet closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $10,250?  This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is consistently reducing her price, and we're aiming for a final price below $10,000. Let's make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made. How about $10,000 even? That's a strong offer, and it would allow me to close this deal today."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We're holding firm at $10,000. This puts the decision point squarely with Alice, and she may be tempted to accept to avoid further negotiation."
