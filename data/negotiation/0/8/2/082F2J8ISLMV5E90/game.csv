"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,200. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can do $11,000 - it's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal today if you accept.",11000.0,Bob,6,
