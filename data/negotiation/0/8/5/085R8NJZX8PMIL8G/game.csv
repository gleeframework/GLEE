"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm serious about making this deal work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $975,000? That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value this product brings.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. $1,050,000 is a substantial amount, and I need to be cautious with my investments. I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's really pushing my budget to the limit. I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about this purchase, and this offer reflects that.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to make one final compromise at $1,025,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
