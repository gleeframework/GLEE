"I can see you're interested in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Can you consider that price?",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $142. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I think $125 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and my previous offer of $142. How about $133.50?",133.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $133.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $128 for the product. Can you consider that price?",128.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $132. This is my last offer, so I hope we can agree on a price.",132.0,Alice,9,
