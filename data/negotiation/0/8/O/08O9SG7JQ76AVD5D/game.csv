"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, and I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
