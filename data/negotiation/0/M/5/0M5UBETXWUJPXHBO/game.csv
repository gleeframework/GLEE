"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests.",875000.0,Alice,3,
