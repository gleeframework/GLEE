"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I think this product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a price that's more realistic. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This reflects its true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
