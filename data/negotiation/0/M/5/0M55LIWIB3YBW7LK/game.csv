"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go down to $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $19000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can meet me here.",19000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $17000. I'm going to have to stand firm at $19000. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,9,
