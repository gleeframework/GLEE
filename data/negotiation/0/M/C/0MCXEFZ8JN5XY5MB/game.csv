"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher price to make this work for me.  How about $11,000? This would still represent a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $10,900? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's close this deal!",10900.0,Alice,5,
