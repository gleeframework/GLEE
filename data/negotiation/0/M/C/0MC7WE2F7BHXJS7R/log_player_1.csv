I'm starting with a price of $135. This is above my minimum of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my original offer.  There's no guarantee that John will still be interested if I reject Bob's offer, but I'm willing to take that risk to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  Hopefully, it's enticing enough for him to accept, but still gives me a bit more profit than selling to John."
