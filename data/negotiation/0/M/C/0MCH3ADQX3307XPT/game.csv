,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10500? It's a compromise from both of our last offers, and it allows you to get this valuable product at a great price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.
