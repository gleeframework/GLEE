"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're willing to work with me at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
