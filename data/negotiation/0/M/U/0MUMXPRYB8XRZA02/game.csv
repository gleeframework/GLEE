"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
