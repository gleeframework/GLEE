"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. My counteroffer is $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. My counteroffer is $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
