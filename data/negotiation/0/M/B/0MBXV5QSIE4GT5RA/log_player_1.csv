**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to move significantly from his initial offer.  While he's inching up slightly, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll come close to a price that's acceptable to you within the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it makes the most sense to cut your losses with Bob and finalize the deal with John."
