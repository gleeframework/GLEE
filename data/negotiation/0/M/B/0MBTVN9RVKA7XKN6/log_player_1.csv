Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still generate a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that's likely to be tempting to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still leaving me with a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""special price"" to make the offer more enticing. 
 
It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, it represents a good balance between maximizing potential profit and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
