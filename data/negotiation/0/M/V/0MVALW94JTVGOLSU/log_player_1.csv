Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for both parties.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  The $800,000 offer from John acts as a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.

By setting a high but reasonable initial price, Alice increases her chances of securing the best possible outcome in the negotiation with Bob."
