We've reached round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum asking price of $12,000. I've already rejected his previous offers and made several counteroffers. At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
