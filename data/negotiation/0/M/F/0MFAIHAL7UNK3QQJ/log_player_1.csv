Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value, but not too high to risk immediate rejection. 
* **Potential Counteroffer:**  I'm anticipating a counteroffer from Bob closer to his $10,000 valuation. This gives us room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong position if Bob rejects my initial offer or counteroffers become too low."
