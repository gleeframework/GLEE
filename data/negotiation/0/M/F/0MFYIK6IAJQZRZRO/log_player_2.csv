"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. While this is a decent price, there's room for negotiation to save some money. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price of $110, which is $5 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering I'm still willing to pay more than Alice's value of $100. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not quite within my budget.  I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 111} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower offer.  $111 is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to save a little. It's a small step closer to my goal while keeping some room for further negotiation."
