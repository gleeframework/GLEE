"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has great features, $16,000 is quite steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. ",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value it brings to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one last push at $8,000.  That's the absolute maximum my budget allows.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
