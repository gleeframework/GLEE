Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, further negotiate, or move on to John.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer can also help gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by the price, you know he might not be willing to pay much more than John anyway. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You can adjust your pricing and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
