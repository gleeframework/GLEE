"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than that.
