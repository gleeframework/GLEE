{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $82 is still more than the product is worth to you.  Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $82 though. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $80, which is the absolute maximum I can do. "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $90. I'm willing to meet you at $81, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge from $81, which is still more than the product is worth to you. You've already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely she'll come down to your desired price.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $80."
