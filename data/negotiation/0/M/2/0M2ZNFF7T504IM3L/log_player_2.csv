"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly sought after by many. Given its value and quality, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. Considering its worth and your potential interest, I propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
