"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I have 8 more rounds to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is too low. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still have 6 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with continued negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still not quite enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
