Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's important to price the product above $80 (John's offer) to ensure you're making the most profit."
