"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and John is selling it for that exact price, it's the most logical choice. There's no need to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for the maximum price you're willing to pay immediately."
