Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm aiming for a higher figure, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Let's say $1,400,000. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her current offer. It's better to secure the product from John at your budget limit rather than risk the negotiation failing and potentially missing out entirely."
