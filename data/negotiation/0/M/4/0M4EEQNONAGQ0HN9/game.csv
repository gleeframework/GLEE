"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify spending that much. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm aiming for a higher figure, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value and potential of this product, even at a significant discount from my initial ask.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too large for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Let's say $1,400,000. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to make this deal work.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
