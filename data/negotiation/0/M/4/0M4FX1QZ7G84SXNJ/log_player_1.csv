Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also conscious of the $800,000 floor I set for myself and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than I'd like to get. I'm confident that I can do better by continuing to negotiate.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's offer, but I'm also being reasonable.  I'm aiming to meet in the middle, hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good compromise and closer to what I'm looking for. Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could risk a breakdown in the negotiation.  Selling to John would only get me $800,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
