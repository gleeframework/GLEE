"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $13,000? I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but the product's value is undeniable. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
