"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider it?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $1400000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I've seen in the product so far.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
