"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value is much higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to consider $1400000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1000000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to consider $1200000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1000000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
