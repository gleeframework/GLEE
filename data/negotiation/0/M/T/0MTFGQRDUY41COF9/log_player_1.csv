Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Friendly and positive:** I'm using friendly language to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob what he thinks, which encourages him to engage in the conversation and express his own value assessment of the product. 

This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation."
