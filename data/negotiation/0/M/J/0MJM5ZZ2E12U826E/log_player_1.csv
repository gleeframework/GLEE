Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below my initial valuation ($12,000) makes the deal seem more attractive to Bob. It's still significantly higher than his perceived value ($8,000) and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from overthinking or trying to lowball me.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm happy to sell to John at my desired minimum price."
