"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value you've outlined, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's aim for a more balanced agreement at $825,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 825000}
