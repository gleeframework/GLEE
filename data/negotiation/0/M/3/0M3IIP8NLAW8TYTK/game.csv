"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $800,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
