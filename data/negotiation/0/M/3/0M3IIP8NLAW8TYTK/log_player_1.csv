Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $800,000 doesn't reflect that.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.

While Bob is moving upwards, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut negotiations short and take the guaranteed $1,000,000."
