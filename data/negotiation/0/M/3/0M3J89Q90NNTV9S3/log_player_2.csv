# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $102? It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $102 gets you the product for a decent price compared to John's $120.  Continuing to negotiate risks either frustrating Alice or ending up with a price closer to John's anyway."
