,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering it's the most I'm willing to spend.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $14,625? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",14625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that. How about we settle on $14,250?  That's a reasonable offer, and we can both agree to it and move on.",14250.0,Bob,6,
