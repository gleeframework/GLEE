Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, it suggests he might not be willing to go much higher than your minimum. If he counters, you can negotiate from there. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
