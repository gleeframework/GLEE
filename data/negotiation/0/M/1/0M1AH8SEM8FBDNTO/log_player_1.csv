"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,800,000. It's a steal considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This establishes a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a ""steal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,800,000 price leaves significant room for negotiation, allowing for multiple rounds before reaching my minimum of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, there's still potential to increase the price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate and willing to play the negotiation game. This can encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  By rejecting, I maintain the opportunity to secure a better deal with Bob or explore the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,600,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a middle ground, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify my price. 
* **Balanced Approach:** The counteroffer is still significantly higher than my minimum, keeping my profits in mind, but also shows good faith in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $1,500,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are already in round 4, meaning only 6 rounds left before the negotiation ends.  
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob, potentially forcing me to sell to John at the lower price.

**Accepting the offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of a worse outcome.**"
