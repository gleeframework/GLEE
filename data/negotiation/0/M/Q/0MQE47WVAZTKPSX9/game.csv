"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, that price undervalues the true worth of this product. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair offer, considering its value to me. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
