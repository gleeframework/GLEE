"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that benefits both of us.  To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you even greater returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
