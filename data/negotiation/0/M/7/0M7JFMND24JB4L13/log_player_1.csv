"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,500,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **Starting High:** Opening with a high price sets the bar and gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Value Statement:**  Mentioning ""valuable asset"" subtly suggests the product is worth more than the price. 
* **Open Invitation:**  Ending with ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and his counteroffers in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this asset. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price this early in the negotiation.  I'll try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer. 
* **Potential Value:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, as he's already expressed interest.

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Justification:**  I emphasize the ""unique value"" of the product, hoping to subtly reinforce its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Compromise Tone:** ""Fair price for both of us"" suggests a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a limit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he again rejects my offer, I'll have to assess whether to continue negotiating or to explore selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has declared this to be his ""final offer,"" meaning further negotiation might be futile.
* **John's Option:**  While I could sell to John for the same price, continuing to negotiate with Bob may allow me to potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a stalled deal."
