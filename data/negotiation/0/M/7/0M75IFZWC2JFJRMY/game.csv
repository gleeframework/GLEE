"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm trying to save some money here. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a better return on my investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,250. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $10,400? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value for the product.",10400.0,Alice,5,
