"I understand you're on a budget, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I think you're undervaluing the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if this is something you can work with.",11500.0,Bob,6,
