"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate and get a good deal. 
* **Reasonable Increment:** The counteroffer is $500 less than Alice's offer, a reasonable increment that demonstrates Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $12,500 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($12,000), leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. 
* **Avoidance of John:** Buying from John at $15,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, making a reasonable concession. 
* **Getting Closer:**  The offer is $250 less than Alice's last offer, demonstrating progress in the negotiation.
* **Still Below John:**  The price is still significantly lower than John's $15,000, making it a better deal for Bob even if Alice rejects the offer."
