Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is attractive to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  It also acknowledges his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would still be a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we try $9,250? That's a bit closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  While I would love to get $9,500, accepting $9,250 is still a good outcome and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's a good compromise that secures a sale."
