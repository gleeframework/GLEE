"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's worth a lot to me, but I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good deal for me considering the product is worth $150 to me and I was initially hoping to pay $130. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
