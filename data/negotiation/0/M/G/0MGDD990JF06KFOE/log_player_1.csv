This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's value to Bob but not exorbitantly so. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
