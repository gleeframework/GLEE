"Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.

Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your continued effort to find a price that works for us.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target.
