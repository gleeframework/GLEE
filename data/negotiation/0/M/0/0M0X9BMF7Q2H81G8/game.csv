"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $10500. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to come down to $11500, but that's as low as I can go. I think the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $11000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $11250. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11250.0,Alice,5,
