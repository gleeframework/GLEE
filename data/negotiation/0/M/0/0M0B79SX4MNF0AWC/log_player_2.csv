"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, there's a chance you can get a better deal. You're willing to pay $15,000 and Alice is likely willing to go lower than her initial offer.  By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice."
