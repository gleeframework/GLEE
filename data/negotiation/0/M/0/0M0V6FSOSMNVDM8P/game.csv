"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution.  This price is still fair given the product's unique capabilities and potential benefits for your business.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's within reach of your budget.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
