Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but I think I can do better than that. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a free premium service package that's normally worth $2000.
