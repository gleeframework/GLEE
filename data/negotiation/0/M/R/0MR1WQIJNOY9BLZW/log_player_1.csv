Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob first allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a substantial gain. This price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but the message emphasizes the ""value"" to encourage him to consider. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
