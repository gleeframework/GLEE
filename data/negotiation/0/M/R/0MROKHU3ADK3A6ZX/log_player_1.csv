Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why my price is higher, I'm hinting at additional value Bob might be unaware of (""significant value,"" ""worthwhile investment""). 
* **Backup Plan:** I know John will buy the product for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  If Bob is a tough negotiator, I might need to lower my price closer to his perceived value.
* **Relationship Building:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, I might offer a smaller markup to secure the deal and build goodwill."
