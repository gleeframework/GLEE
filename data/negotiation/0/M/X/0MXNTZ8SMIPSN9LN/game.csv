"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
