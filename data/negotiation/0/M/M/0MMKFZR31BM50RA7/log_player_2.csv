"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price, closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to pay much less than Alice's starting price. Offering $100 gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying within my $120 budget.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable, increasing the chances of reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $125. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, and this offer is only $5 more than my alternative with John. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal from Alice, and it's not worth the risk of her raising the price again."
