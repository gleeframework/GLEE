"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if he's seriously interested.  I'm confident that if he rejects, I can still get a good price from him or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is still a good amount for Bob, as he values it at $1,200,000.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, while still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my initial goal, I believe I can still do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,020,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. I'm hoping this will tempt Bob into accepting, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's very close to my initial goal, and we're running out of rounds.  There's a risk that Bob might counteroffer again, and potentially drop the price further, or that John might pull out of the deal. It's time to take a good offer and secure the deal."
