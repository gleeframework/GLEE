"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than its true value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for $100, saving you $20 compared to buying it from John.  While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $120 is not worth it."
