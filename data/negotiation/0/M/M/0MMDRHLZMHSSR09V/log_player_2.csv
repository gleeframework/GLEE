"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.  How about $11,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.
