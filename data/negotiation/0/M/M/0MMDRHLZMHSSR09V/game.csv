"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.  How about $11,500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
