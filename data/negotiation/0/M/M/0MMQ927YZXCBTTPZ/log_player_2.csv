You are still within range of your target price. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get Alice to lower her price closer to $1,200,000."

Alice's offer is $1,290,000.  While this is a great price, you can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal.  It's time to move on and buy from John."
