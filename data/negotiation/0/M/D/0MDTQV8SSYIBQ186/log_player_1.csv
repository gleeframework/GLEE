Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, aiming for a price closer to that maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down a bit, while still keeping the price well above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a pre-public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making the offer more enticing."
