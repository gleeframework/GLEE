Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I know I can get at least $800,000 from John, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **The Offer:**  $950,000 is a good middle ground. It's a significant profit for me, and a decent deal for Bob, allowing him to still make a profit. 

This offer balances my desire for a high price with the need to secure the sale, as there's always a chance Bob might reject and I'll have to settle for John's offer."
