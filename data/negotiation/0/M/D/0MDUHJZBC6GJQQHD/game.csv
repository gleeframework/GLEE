"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something around $1,025,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $1,025,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us to close the deal.  I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay close to this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $1,025,000. Perhaps we could split the difference and settle at $1,037,500?  This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1037500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,037,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm really close to selling to another buyer, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to come down to $1,045,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?",1045000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've driven a hard bargain, and I respect that you're trying to get a fair price. I understand you have other options, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,040,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to what I've budgeted for this purchase. Let me know if we have a deal.",1040000.0,Bob,8,
