* **Message:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation, but also highlighting the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to negotiate. 
* If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer and try to find a compromise within the 10 rounds.
* I'm always aware of the $1,200,000 offer from John, which serves as a safety net if negotiations fail."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,037,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I'm really close to selling to another buyer, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. I'm willing to come down to $1,045,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1045000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still below my initial offer. This shows flexibility while remaining firm.

* The ""almost selling to another buyer"" tactic can be effective in creating urgency and encouraging Bob to make a final decision.
* The goal is to secure a deal at a price as close as possible to my desired price, while still ensuring a win-win situation.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've driven a hard bargain, and I respect that you're trying to get a fair price. I understand you have other options, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,040,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to what I've budgeted for this purchase. Let me know if we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the offer:** Bob's offer of $1,040,000 is only $10,000 below my desired price.  With only 2 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a deal with John over a small amount of money. 
* **Final decision:** This offer is the best I'm likely to get from Bob.  Considering the risk of losing the sale to John, accepting this offer is the most financially sensible choice.

**Strategy:**

* I'm prioritizing securing the sale over maximizing my profit in this final round.
* The risk of John's offer outweighs the potential gain of pushing for a slightly higher price.
* This is a strategic decision to secure a deal and avoid losing the opportunity completely."
