Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're very close now. I understand you want to get a good price, but $1,137,500 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  You only have one round left, and while you could make another counteroffer, it's highly unlikely she will go any lower.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
