Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $2,000,000, considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is trending downwards and getting increasingly distant from our desired outcome.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's better to secure the guaranteed amount than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
