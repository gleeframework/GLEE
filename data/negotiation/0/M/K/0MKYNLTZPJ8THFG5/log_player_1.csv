"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the value of the product for Bob, hoping to sway him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we are already in round 4.  The risk of continuing the negotiation and getting a lower price is too high. I'm better off selling to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
