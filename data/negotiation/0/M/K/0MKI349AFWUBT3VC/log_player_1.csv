Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves room for me to adjust the price if Bob counters, while still ensuring I maximize my potential profit. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have the advantage of John's offer, which provides me with a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can potentially push the price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great value for your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product for Bob, reinforcing the potential return on investment.
* **Building a Relationship:** By showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, I aim to build a rapport with Bob and increase the chances of a successful transaction.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will need to reassess my strategy based on his counteroffer, taking into account John's offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $910,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $910,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase in price, considering Bob's budget constraints and his unwillingness to budge much.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could ultimately lead to a lower price or a failed deal. 

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit of $1,200,000.  The time and effort required for further negotiation with Bob are not worth the potential gain."
