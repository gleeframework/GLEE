"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's close a deal at $12,000.  This gives you a significant savings over its true value and me a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $12,000 saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is selling it for $12,000, so you're getting a $3,000 discount."
