Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potential profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with $950,000 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started lower.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""other potential buyers"" add a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
