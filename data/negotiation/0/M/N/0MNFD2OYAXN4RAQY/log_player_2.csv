"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my target price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget.  I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. If she rejects this offer, I will continue to negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. After considering our costs and the market value, I am willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still higher than my desired price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. I still have 7 rounds left and there is a possibility that Alice might be willing to drop her price even further, especially with the threat of me going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. This price is still within my budget and hopefully closer to what Alice is willing to accept. My goal is to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've reviewed our costs again and I'm willing to consider $1,090,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our positions. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is within my budget and significantly lower than her initial offer. It's getting close to my ideal price, and with only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal. It's a good compromise that secures the product within my budget."
