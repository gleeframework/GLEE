Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for someone with your interests. Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and staying close to John's offer. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as fair, increasing the likelihood of Bob considering the offer seriously.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price."
