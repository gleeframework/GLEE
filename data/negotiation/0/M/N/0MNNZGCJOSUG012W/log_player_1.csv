{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but not so high that he'll immediately reject it. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm confident I can get at least $150 from John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider a price closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low for me. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further. I'm still confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $100. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I've tried to negotiate with Bob, it seems he's unwilling to go higher.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a low price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's the best option available to me at this point."
