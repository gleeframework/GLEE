"Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $100. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
