"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still finding it a bit expensive. How about $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be reasonable. However, I can't justify going over $9,000. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me think for a moment...",9500.0,Alice,7,
