"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is too high. We know we have room to negotiate downwards towards Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a strong counteroffer slightly above Alice's known value. This tests the waters to see if Alice might accept a quick deal with a reasonable profit. If she rejects, we can adjust in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction but still significantly above her known value. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can push the price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still finding it a bit expensive. How about $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're moving closer to Alice's value but still giving ourselves some bargaining room. This offer is a significant step down from our previous offer and splits the difference between her last offer and our target price.  We'll see how she responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you the product for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is claiming this is her final offer, we still have some room to negotiate.  Her offer is still $1200 above her value, and we're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation. We'll make one more counteroffer, but we should be prepared to accept a price around $9,000 or consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be reasonable. However, I can't justify going over $9,000. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. This firm counteroffer at $9,000 sets a clear boundary while still offering Alice a good profit. By stating this is our final offer, we increase the pressure on Alice to accept. If she declines, we'll likely move on to John's offer in the next round, unless Alice comes back with a significant concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me think for a moment... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm at $9,500, which is significantly above her value and only a small concession from her previous offer. She seems unlikely to move much further. Given we have a standing offer from John at $12,000, and we're running out of rounds, it's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John. We've negotiated well, but it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement significantly better than John's offer with Alice."
