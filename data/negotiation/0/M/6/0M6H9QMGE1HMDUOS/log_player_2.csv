Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I believe the product is a good fit for my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think $700,000 is a more reasonable price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you and ensures I get a price closer to the product's true value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference again and go with $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it ensures I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","It seems like Alice is trying to get me to buy the product at the exact price she wants, which is the same as John's price. I'm not willing to pay more than I need to. I'll reject her offer and stick to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay the same price as John, which is $800,000, but I'd like to make it clear that I'm doing so because I'm not willing to pay more, not because I'm trying to take advantage of Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet John's price of $800,000, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. I'm not trying to lowball you, but I do need to make a business decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
