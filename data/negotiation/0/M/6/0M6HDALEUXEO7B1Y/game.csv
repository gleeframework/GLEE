"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a very competitive price of $850,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and this offer gives you a significant margin.  Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $720,000.  Would that be feasible?",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for a lower price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $735,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",735000.0,Alice,5,
