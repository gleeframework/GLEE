"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about $13500? That's a good compromise, and we can move forward with the sale.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $11500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11500 is closer to my bottom line, but I'd prefer to stay at $12500. This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle on this.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $12000? I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
