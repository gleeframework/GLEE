Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could try to negotiate further, $105 is a reasonable compromise.  We're getting the product for significantly less than Alice's initial offer, and continuing to push might lead to a breakdown in negotiations."
