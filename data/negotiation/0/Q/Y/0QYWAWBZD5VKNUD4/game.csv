,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $90 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider $120, which I believe is a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $105, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that.",105.0,Bob,4,
