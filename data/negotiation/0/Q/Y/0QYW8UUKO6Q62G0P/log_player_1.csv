Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a better offer to consider selling to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
