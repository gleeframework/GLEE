"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that you're working with a tighter budget. However, I've got to consider the value that the product brings to you, and I believe it's worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
