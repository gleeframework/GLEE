"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a free maintenance package worth $1,000 with the purchase of the product. This brings the total value to $12,500, which is still below my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000 plus the maintenance package, which is a total of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
