"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $11,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal value of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a free maintenance package worth $1,000 with the purchase of the product. This brings the total value to $12,500, which is still below my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000 plus the maintenance package, which is a total of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The offer of $12,000 is still within Bob's budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Extras:** The added maintenance package is a significant bonus that increases the overall value of the product. It's effectively a $1,000 discount on the product price.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice sticking to her $11,500 price, or even raising the price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price close to Bob's budget with an added benefit.
* **Time:** There are only 5 rounds left.  Further negotiations might lead to a stalemate or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a decent deal on a product he needs, with an added bonus, and avoids the risk of a more expensive purchase or a potential deal breakdown."
