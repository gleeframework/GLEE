Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000.  This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can get a similar price in future negotiations. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the sale and move on."
