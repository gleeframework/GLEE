"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget though.  Would you consider something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $15,000? This product really is worth it.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While the product looks great, $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we meet somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you see the value in this product.  $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but let's make this work. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
