"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum desired price. It signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also shows I won't settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal. I have more rounds left and I don't want to settle for less if possible."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a range that I believe is fair. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both of us can be happy with the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $10,000. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're running out of time.  I'm not confident we can reach an agreement that benefits me more within the remaining rounds."
