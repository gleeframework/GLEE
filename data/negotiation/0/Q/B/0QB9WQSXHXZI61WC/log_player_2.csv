"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better price from Alice, and even if he can't, he has the option to buy from John for $12,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm definitely interested in the product,  $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm confident this price would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fantastic product and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,000 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
