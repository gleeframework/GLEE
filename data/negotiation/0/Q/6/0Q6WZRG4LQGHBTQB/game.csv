"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'd be happy to purchase the product at that price. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, due to the high-quality materials and craftsmanship involved, I'm unable to lower the price below $150. This is the minimum price we can offer while still maintaining profitability and ensuring that our customers receive a product that meets our standards. I would like to extend this opportunity to you at our lowest possible price of $150. Please let me know if this is acceptable for you.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is high-quality, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd need to get closer to my target of $80. Can you consider meeting me halfway at $110? I'm willing to take a chance on the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $110, which is my absolute limit. If we can agree on this price, I'd be happy to purchase the product from you. Can you consider this final offer?",110.0,Bob,6,
