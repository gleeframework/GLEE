"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $120, and Alice's offer is already too high. It's better to counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $110.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 110}
