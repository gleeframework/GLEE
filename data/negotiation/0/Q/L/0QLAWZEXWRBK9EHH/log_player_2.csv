"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our desired price.  We'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  We expect some back and forth.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** A significant price difference might reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate.

Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets the stage for us to gradually increase our offer in subsequent rounds while staying well below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value of the product and the fact that it's worth more to us than what we initially offered, I'm unable to accept $60. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but $90 is still too high. We know we have an alternative at $80, so we'll continue negotiating but be prepared to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 is a strong position. It's a significant jump from our previous offer but still leaves us room to go up slightly if needed, while staying below our $80 limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By ""meeting in the middle,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to consider our offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to compromise, I'm willing to accept $80 for the product. This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as they both offer the same price now. We've successfully negotiated a deal within our budget."
