"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a counter-offer that's halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $85 is still below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about we settle at $90? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between our current positions. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and hopefully leads to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. We're not making much progress and Bob seems unwilling to budge. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $100. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing this negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price."
