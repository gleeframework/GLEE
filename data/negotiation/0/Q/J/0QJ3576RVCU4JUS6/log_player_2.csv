"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from Alice, as it's worth $800,000 to her. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to profit, as it's significantly higher than the product's worth to her. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and if Alice rejects it, you can continue to lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, although it's come down. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get the price lower. You're better off continuing the negotiation process with Alice rather than buying from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating that you are willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. It's likely that Alice will be more receptive to this offer than your previous one, as it's closer to her desired price point while still being a significant discount from her initial offer."
