Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his perceived value while still securing a hefty profit for me. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, but it's a strong starting point."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired profit."
