I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profits while still potentially striking a deal with Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to potentially negotiate further."
