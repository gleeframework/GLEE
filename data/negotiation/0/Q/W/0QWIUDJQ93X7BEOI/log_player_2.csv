"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend a little less. Would you be willing to do $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you consider $10,500? It's a small concession on my end, but I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $10,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation."
