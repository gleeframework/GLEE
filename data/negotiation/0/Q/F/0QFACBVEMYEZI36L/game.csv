"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we try $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price you're suggesting is getting close to what I could lose if I simply held onto it. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need at least $14,000 for the product. ",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we settle at $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
