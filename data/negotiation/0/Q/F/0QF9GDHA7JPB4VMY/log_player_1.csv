"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $107.50 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $110. I've got a few more rounds to work with before I have to consider selling to John."
