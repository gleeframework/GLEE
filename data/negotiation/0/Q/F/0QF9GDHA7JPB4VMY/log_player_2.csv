{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You'll try to negotiate a lower price first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming to save money. $110 is closer to your ideal price but still a bit high. You'll try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $109. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is very close to your ideal price. You've already tried negotiating a lower price, and continuing could risk her walking away or you having to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best option to get a good deal and ensure you get the product."
