"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll sell the product to you for $1,520,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find reasonable.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
