"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's target, he's still not at a price he's happy with.  He can likely negotiate further and get a better deal than $9,200.  It's still better than buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to be flexible, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $8,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $9,500 is still too high. He can likely negotiate further and get a better price. Buying from John is still an option, but it's more advantageous to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. I think the product's value is worth a bit more than your last offer. Let me think about it... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's goal:** $9,200 is a better price than the previous offer of $9,500.
* **Time is running out:** There are only 3 rounds left.  
* **John's price is a backup:** If the negotiation fails, Bob can still buy the product from John for $10,000.

While Bob would prefer a slightly lower price, accepting this offer provides a decent deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation completely falling apart."
