Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent amount of profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to go up to $850,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and attempt to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $850,000 offer, and I'm not willing to accept that price.  It's simply too far below my minimum desired price. It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,000,000."
