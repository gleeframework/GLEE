Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" is designed to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to haggle. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By saying ""great deal"" Alice aims to frame the price as appealing even though it's above what Bob ideally wants to pay.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price from John if needed."
