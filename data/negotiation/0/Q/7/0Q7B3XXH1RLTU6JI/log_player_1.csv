Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is holding firm and we're getting dangerously close to my fallback price with John. Accepting $1,200,000 now secures a significant profit."
