"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's always room to try and negotiate a lower price.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get an even better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to his $800,000 target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential for more back-and-forth negotiation isn't worth it.  At $925,000, Bob is still getting a good deal and avoiding the higher price from John."
