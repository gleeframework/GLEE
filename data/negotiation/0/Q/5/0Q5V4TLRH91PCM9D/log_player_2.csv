"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. This item holds significant worth to me, but I believe its true value extends beyond my understanding. Given its rarity and potential for future appreciation, I estimate its market value to be well above $10000. To ensure a fair transaction, I propose selling it to you for $15000. This price reflects not only its current condition and utility but also accounts for its potential growth in value over time. Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss further details.
