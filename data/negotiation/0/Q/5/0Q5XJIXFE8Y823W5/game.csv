"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. How about we meet at $14000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
