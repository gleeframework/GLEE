"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to compromise on. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering both our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $700,000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our prices is still significant. To be candid, I have another offer at $800,000.  If you can meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to meet that price of $800,000. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,500,000.",900000.0,Alice,7,
