"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This still gives you a good price, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
