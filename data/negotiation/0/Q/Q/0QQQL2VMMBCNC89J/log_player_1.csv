Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate down too much. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's ""business acumen"" aims to appeal to his desire for a good deal and potentially justify the price."
