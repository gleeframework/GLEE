"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering we both want to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
