"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This seems to be a fair compromise considering both our positions.",14500.0,Bob,6,
