Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while also aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm now offering the product for $10,000, which is my minimum value.  This is a compromise from my initial offer and gives Bob a better price than my initial offer, but still leaves me satisfied with the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise and allows me to avoid any further negotiation.  There's a chance that Bob might reject a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
