"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a substantial discount, and I'm confident it's a price that represents a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
