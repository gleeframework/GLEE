Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
