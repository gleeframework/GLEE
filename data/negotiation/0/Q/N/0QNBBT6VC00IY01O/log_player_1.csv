"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it will be worth that much to you as well.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This still leaves a substantial margin for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $975,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident we can negotiate a better price. I believe the product's value to Bob warrants a higher price, and with 6 rounds remaining, I have the time to explore further. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more suitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it leaves a significant margin for your needs.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $987,500 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, we're down to 4 rounds and I need to consider the risk of losing the deal. Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit, and it's better than potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for less."
