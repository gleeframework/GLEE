Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is strategically priced:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is still higher than $800,000, giving Bob a slight incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You are willing to take $950,000, which is still more than your minimum of $1,000,000, since you have a fallback option with John.

This approach allows for the possibility of a successful negotiation while still ensuring a profitable outcome for you."
