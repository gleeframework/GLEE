"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm optimistic about closing the deal with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind if we can't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider selling to John. There's still potential here to get a better price, and I want to exhaust all options with Bob before I move on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down a bit. I'm hoping this is enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he doesn't accept, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000, which would be $9750. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough spot, as Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. However, I've already made several concessions, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on.  While it's always better to get a higher price, I'm prioritizing certainty and closing the deal in a timely manner."
