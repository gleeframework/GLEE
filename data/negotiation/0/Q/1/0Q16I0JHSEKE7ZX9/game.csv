"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $10000, but that's my final offer. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000, which would be $9750. Can you consider this compromise?",9750.0,Bob,6,
