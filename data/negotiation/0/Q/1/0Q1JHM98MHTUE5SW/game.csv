"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value in working with you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this price represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000, which is $10500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
