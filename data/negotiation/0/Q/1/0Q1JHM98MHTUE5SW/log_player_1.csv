Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
