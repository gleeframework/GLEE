"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal compared to the product's actual value, Bob can potentially save even more money by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to his budget, he can still potentially save more by continuing to negotiate.  He's still within range of his target price and can try to get Alice down even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1,300,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  At $1,320,000, the price is within Bob's budget and is a good deal considering the product's value.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
