"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $1,300,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
