{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, there's a chance you can negotiate a better price.  It's also too early to buy from John as you haven't explored any potential for lower prices with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's important to leave room for further negotiation, but still show that you're serious about getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still within my budget. However, there's a chance she might be willing to go lower. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price. This counteroffer is a compromise between her last offer and my previous one. It keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to lower her price, and her offer is now within my budget. It's getting closer to my desired price point, and continuing to negotiate may not yield much more savings.  Furthermore, we are nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures the purchase within my budget and reduces the risk of further rounds resulting in a worse outcome."
