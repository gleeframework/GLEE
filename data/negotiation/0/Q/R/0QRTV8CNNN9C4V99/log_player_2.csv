I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you and the original price I offered.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $925,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $925,500. Accepting this offer secures a savings of $74,500 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
