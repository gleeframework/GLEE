Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  It's worth the investment for the right buyer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, suggesting he's willing to pay more. I'll continue negotiating for a better price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has stopped increasing his offer and has plateaued at $1,200,000. This suggests he might not be willing to go much higher.  We'll apply a bit more pressure to see if he'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I've tried to be flexible. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000.  I'd much rather see this go to you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,275,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to introduce a sense of urgency and a hard limit. This message achieves both. By mentioning John's offer, we show Bob we have other options and are serious about our bottom line. Presenting it as a final offer adds pressure for him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer ready to purchase at $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to pay $1,275,000. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has increased his offer again, and we're now at $1,225,000. While we could push for a bit more, it's getting riskier.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
