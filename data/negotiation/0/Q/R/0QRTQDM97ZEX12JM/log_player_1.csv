``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a starting point and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is only willing to pay $9,800, which is still below my minimum value of $15,000. It seems like we're at an impasse. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
