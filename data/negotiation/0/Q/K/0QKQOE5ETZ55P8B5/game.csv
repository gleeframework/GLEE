"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9000.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9500, which is a significant amount for me. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that the product will still provide significant value to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
