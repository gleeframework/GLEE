"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price or explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500, which is a significant amount for me. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that the product will still provide significant value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,800 is a good price and shows Alice's willingness to negotiate, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Given that Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense for Bob to take that option and save the extra $2,800.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of getting stuck with a price higher than John's offer."
