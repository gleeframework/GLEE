"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $100. What do you think? Would you be interested in purchasing it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is above your maximum price of $80.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is still below Alice's minimum price of $120, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy allows us to potentially close the deal while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $95? This still reflects the value of the product while making it more accessible to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum of $80.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay within my limit of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually increasing my offer while remaining below Alice's minimum. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay.  $90 is a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. How about we try $92? It's slightly above your previous offer but still below my initial asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $92 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum of $80. It is tempting, but I still believe there is room for negotiation. I'd like to see if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my previous offer of $90. I believe it's a fair compromise, and by sticking to it, I show that I'm serious about closing the deal.  Alice has already lowered her price, and I'm hoping she'll recognize the value of reaching an agreement at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $91. This is a step closer to your offer, reflecting the value of the product while staying within your budget. I hope this helps us reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

To avoid risking further negotiation and the possibility of not reaching an agreement, I will buy the product from John for $80. This ensures I get the product at my desired price and avoids further negotiation risk."
