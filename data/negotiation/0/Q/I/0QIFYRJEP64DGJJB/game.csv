"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $9500. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $8250?",8250.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8250. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8750. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but I think that's the most I can afford. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $9000. This is a great price, and I think you'll be very happy with the product at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
