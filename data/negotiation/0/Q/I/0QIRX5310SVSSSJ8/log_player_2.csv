"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($110) is within your budget ($120).** 
* **Buying from Alice is cheaper than buying from John ($120).**

Even though you could save $10 by waiting to see if John offers a better price, there's no guarantee he will.  It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
