"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this is still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've given it some thought and am willing to go up to $9,200 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value.",9200.0,Bob,4,
