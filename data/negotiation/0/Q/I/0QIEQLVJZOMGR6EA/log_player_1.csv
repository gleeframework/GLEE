Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product at this price, as it's still well below his perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my desired price point and still significantly above my minimum value of $8,000.  Accepting his offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
