Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $200,000, making it a very attractive deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while still ensuring the sale and avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
