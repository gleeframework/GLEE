Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $8000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $8,000 is too low, and I believe I can secure a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,500 is a decent offer, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also getting closer to my minimum of $8,000, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
