,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
