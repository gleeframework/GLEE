"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to selling to another buyer for $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,
