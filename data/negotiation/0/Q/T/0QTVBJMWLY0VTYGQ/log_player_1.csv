"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to see how flexible Bob is willing to be. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price and the negotiation seems to be going nowhere. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the best possible price for the product."
