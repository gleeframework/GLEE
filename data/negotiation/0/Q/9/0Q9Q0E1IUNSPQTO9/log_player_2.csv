"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and buying from John for the same price is strategically the same. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer in this scenario."
