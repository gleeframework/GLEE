"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $135. How about we try $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $132 is still a bit too low for me. How about we try $134? It's a small step from my previous offer and would be a great deal for you. ",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I'd rather pay $132.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $132.50 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $133.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",133.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $133.50. I'd be willing to meet you at $132.75, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",132.75,Bob,8,
