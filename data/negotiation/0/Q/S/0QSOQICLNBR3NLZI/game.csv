"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and capabilities.  Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
