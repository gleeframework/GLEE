Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down.  Even if he negotiates, there's a good chance I can secure a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my absolute bottom line. 
 
**Important Note:**  I am aware that Bob values the product at $10,000. However, he doesn't know that I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This information asymmetry allows me to aim higher."
