"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to match that price. However, I'd like to extend an alternative offer of $9,500 for the product. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 to you at a reasonable cost. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your needs.",9500.0,Alice,3,
