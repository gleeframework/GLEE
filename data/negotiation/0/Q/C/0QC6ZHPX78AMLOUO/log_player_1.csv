Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate to accept a low offer.

**Important:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to adjust your approach in further communication."
