Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However, $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.  To demonstrate my interest, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $975000.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.
