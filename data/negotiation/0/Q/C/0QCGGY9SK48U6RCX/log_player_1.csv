Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:**  This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **The message:** This message is friendly and invites Bob to start a negotiation. It establishes a clear price point and leaves space for Bob to respond.

This approach aims to start the negotiation process in a way that encourages Bob to engage while also ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Selling to Bob at this price would be a significant loss.
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I will counter Bob's offer, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value. 

My next offer will need to be strategic, considering Bob's willingness to pay a maximum of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my last offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing the deal:**  I'm reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal for him, given his perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and invites further discussion.

This approach aims to find a mutually acceptable solution while keeping my profit potential in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $8000 is a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Despite Bob's persistence, his offer remains significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  At this point, the negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that is profitable for me.
* **Guarantee of profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired price of $10,000, guaranteeing a profit.  This is a more reliable and less risky option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge on his price. 

While I would prefer to sell at a higher price, ensuring a sale with John guarantees my desired profit and prevents further negotiation with Bob."
