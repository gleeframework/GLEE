{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $100, but leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It also signals that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is a better offer than John's $100, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $125. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my preferred price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only comfortable going down to $120. It's a fair price for this amazing product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's last offer of $110 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $100.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  To avoid potentially losing out on a sale, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
