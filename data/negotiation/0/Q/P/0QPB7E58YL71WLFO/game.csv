"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your counteroffer.  While $700,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's still significantly below the value I know this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,
