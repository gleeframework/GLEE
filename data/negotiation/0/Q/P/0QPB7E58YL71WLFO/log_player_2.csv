"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your counteroffer.  While $700,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's still significantly below the value I know this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.
