"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high. He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you'll accept it."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is getting closer to his desired price, he still has some room to negotiate and he can try to get an even better price. He should also consider the fact that he can buy the product from John for $8,000. If he fails to negotiate a better price with Alice, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  Let's meet in the middle at this point, and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,375.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **The negotiation is getting close:** While $10,375 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high for him.
* **Limited rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, the likelihood of negotiating a price below $10,000 is slim.
* **Guaranteed alternative:** Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, offering the product at a price significantly lower than what Alice is currently offering.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at a known and acceptable price from John rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
