,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you'll accept it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  Let's meet in the middle at this point, and close the deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,375.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  Let's close the deal at this price.",10375.0,Alice,7,
