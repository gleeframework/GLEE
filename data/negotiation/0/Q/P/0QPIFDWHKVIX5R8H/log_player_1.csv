"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of his acceptance. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,500 is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $15,000 keeps me in a strong negotiating position.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price.
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, encouraging Bob to consider it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While $11,000 is close to my desired price, it leaves room for one more counteroffer if necessary.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still able to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you'll accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $5,000 less than what I could get from John.
* **""Final offer"" is a tactic:** Bob stating this is his final offer is a common negotiation tactic to pressure me into accepting. I won't be pressured.
* **Remaining rounds:** I still have six rounds remaining, and I can always sell to John if I need to.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm positioning this offer as a final concession to demonstrate good faith and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Bridging the gap:** The offer is closer to Bob's final offer, but still $500 above his price, leaving a small margin for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still within my minimum acceptable price, and I can always choose to sell to John.  This gives me a safety net.
* **Urgency:** The message implies urgency by stating ""final compromise"", putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  Let's meet in the middle at this point, and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,250 is still too low:** While we're getting closer, I'm still $4,750 away from my desired price from John.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We only have four rounds left, and I want to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $10,375.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10375} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only three rounds left, I want to move closer to a deal, but still maintain leverage.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes closing the deal, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
