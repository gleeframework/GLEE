"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is more than Alice's offer.
