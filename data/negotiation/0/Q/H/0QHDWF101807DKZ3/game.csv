"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I believe this is a strong starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand budgeting is important, but let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being more in line with your budget.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. It's getting closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
