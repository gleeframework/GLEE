Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
