Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates an incentive for Bob. 
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message implies there's another buyer without explicitly saying it, subtly encouraging Bob to act fast.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, but still ensures a profit if he accepts outright."
