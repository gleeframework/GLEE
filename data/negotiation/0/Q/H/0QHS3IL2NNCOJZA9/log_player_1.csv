I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm still a bit higher than $110.  Would you be willing to go up to $113?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 113}
