Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for a price higher than your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, ensuring you don't lose money if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
