Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Setting the tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great!  We have a deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the price and my overall negotiation goals.
* If I'm not satisfied with the negotiation, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially get a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a compromise.  I need to be realistic about what Bob is willing to pay, but I'm also not willing to give away too much."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can't go as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the value the product offers you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price from $900,000 to $850,000. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message is still friendly and leaves the door open for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: We have a deal!
* If Bob rejects: I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product offers me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away or delaying the deal further. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer means a quicker sale and less time invested in negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
