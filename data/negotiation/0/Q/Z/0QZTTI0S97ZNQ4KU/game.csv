"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but it's still a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm reducing the price to $725,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm ready to offer $710,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession and lower the price to $720,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $720,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $715,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",715000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to make another small concession to get to a deal. I'm reducing the price to $718,000. This is my last offer before I start to get a little nervous about losing the sale to another buyer.",718000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concern about losing the sale, and I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget at $718,000. I'm willing to offer $716,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",716000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a little impatient, Bob, but I still think we can get a deal done. I'm willing to meet you at $719,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's make it happen!",719000.0,Alice,9,
