"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $14,000 is my final offer â€“ it's a great deal for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  However, $14,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I could meet you halfway at $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
