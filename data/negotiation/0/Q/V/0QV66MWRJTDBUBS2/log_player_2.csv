"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a tough ask, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $900,000, which would be $912,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
