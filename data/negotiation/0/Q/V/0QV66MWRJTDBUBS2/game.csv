"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down on price Alice, I appreciate that. To be totally honest though,  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to do $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is close, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to walk away if I can't get it for $900,000. That's really the absolute most I can do.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a tough ask, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $900,000, which would be $912,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",912500.0,Alice,7,
