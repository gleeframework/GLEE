Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly or see if he'll make a counteroffer. You have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $9,200 is close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and conclude the negotiation."
