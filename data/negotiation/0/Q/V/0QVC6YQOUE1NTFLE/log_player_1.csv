"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product.  I'm confident it holds significant value for you. I'm offering it at $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable price. This achieves two things:
    * **Gauges Bob's seriousness:** A very low counter-offer would suggest Bob isn't deeply interested or is trying to undervalue the product.
    * **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It allows me to gradually lower the price to make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, while still aiming for a final price significantly above $1,500,000.

* **Confident Messaging:** My message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an ""opportunity,"" subtly encouraging Bob to consider the potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's likely he's aiming low, knowing there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and present a counter-offer that's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to move closer to his range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. However, I'm still aiming high, well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the high price while acknowledging Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate. This aims to prevent him from getting discouraged by the still-high price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm open to negotiation, I want to make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. This approach keeps the power dynamic more balanced and increases the likelihood of Bob making a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. I can go up to $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased slightly, but it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to signal that he needs to make a more significant jump to keep my interest. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price that's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to meet him closer to the middle ground if he's serious."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're starting to recognize the value this product offers.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000.  This is a significant move on my part and reflects my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by acknowledging Bob's slight increase in price, indicating I see his efforts to move the negotiation forward. 
* **Firm but Fair:** While I'm coming down in price significantly (now only slightly above my minimum), my message emphasizes that this is a major concession. 
* **Urgency and Commitment:** By stating ""to getting this deal done,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to be more aggressive in his next offer if he wants to secure the deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts the price in a range where further negotiation can realistically lead to a win-win situation. Bob gets a better price than my initial offers, and I still get a good deal above my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can stretch to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is his absolute limit.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer from this point.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

While I could try to push Bob a bit further, it's a risky strategy.  It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure a profitable outcome."
