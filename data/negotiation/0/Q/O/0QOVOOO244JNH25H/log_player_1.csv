"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and to make this a win-win, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great profit.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out the $12,000 figure (even if it's aspirational), I'm trying to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.
* **Leaving Room:** My opening offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, even if his counter is still highly profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to his perceived value of $10,000. While it's a profitable deal for me, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. I'm willing to engage in another round to see if I can nudge him closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This price reflects the true value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($500 instead of $1500) to signal that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm holding my ground above Bob's perceived value, emphasizing the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate within reason. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met his perceived value of $10,000. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees me a $2,000 profit, which is a great outcome. It's always better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
