"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for it. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1050000. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1075000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000, but that's my final offer. I'm not going any higher than that.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1075000, but I need you to throw in a premium service package that's worth at least $25000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the premium service package, and I'm still not willing to go up to $1075000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to give up on this deal, Bob. I'll meet you at $1050000, but I need you to agree to a 5% payment plan, where you pay $200000 upfront and the remaining balance in 5 equal installments over the next 5 months. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the payment plan, and I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm willing to make one last offer of $950000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,10,
