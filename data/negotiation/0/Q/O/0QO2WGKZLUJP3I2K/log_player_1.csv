Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $130. I'd like to offer $128. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is getting close to my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better than selling to John, and there's a good chance I won't be able to get a higher offer in the remaining rounds."
