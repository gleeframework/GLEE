Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell the product to John for our minimum price, there's an opportunity to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him, a significant saving.
    * **Alice's Perspective:** Alice earns $100,000 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the deal."
