Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay a premium.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,000 is still a good price and it's likely that further negotiation would only result in a slightly higher price.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
