Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer and see if we can come to an agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price for the value this product offers you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,200,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's coming down in price,  $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John.  I need to weigh the risk of walking away from Bob and settling for John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and go with $1,200,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to you, and I believe we can close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd love to get more from Bob, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. I've already offered a significant discount from my initial asking price, and Bob is still not willing to budge.  With only two rounds left, I need to protect my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is still a good outcome considering my minimum goal."
