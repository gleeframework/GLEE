"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable by offering a price that's halfway between his max budget and Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still keeping his financial limits in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $900,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still above Bob's limit. There is still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing a price that is closer to his budget and closer to Alice's offer, showing his intention to close the deal.  This is a reasonable counter-offer that allows for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating at this price, so I hope you're ready to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While she's signaling a potential deal is close, Bob should continue to negotiate as he's only five rounds away from buying from John at a much lower price. There's still an opportunity to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $890,000, which is a substantial compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's see if we can agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer by a significant amount, showing a clear intent to close the deal.  He's offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer but still within his budget. This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable agreement without risking going over his maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $915,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Alice outweighs the potential savings of further negotiation.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
