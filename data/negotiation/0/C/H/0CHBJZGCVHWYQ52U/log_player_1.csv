{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and your specific needs, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant value."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price allows for a faster sale and avoids potential delays.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob:** Obtains the product for $600,000 less than its value to him.
    * **Alice:** Earns a significant profit of $1,400,000, which is still very close to my guaranteed price.
* **Strong Opening:** This offer establishes a strong starting point for negotiations, leaving room for potential adjustments if Bob counters."
