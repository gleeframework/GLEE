{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, you have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where I might be able to make a deal. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate down without losing too much on her end."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, especially since I have 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget and leaving room for further negotiation. This approach keeps the negotiation moving while still protecting my financial interests."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although she's showing a willingness to negotiate. With 5 rounds remaining and the option to buy from John, it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget and leaving some room for negotiation. With 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I still have some room to negotiate. With three rounds left, I'm going to try to push for a slightly lower price.  Buying from John is always an option if the negotiation stalls, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,750, which is still within my budget and a significant step closer to Alice's price.  With only two rounds left, I need to demonstrate I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one! Alice has lowered her price to $12,000, which is still above my budget, but closer than before.  However, we are in the final round, and it's highly likely Alice will not budge further.  It's a risky move to reject the offer, and I'm not sure if I can negotiate a better price in the remaining round. 

Therefore, it's best to take the safe option and buy from John at $10,000. While I'm not getting the absolute best price, I'm ensuring I get the product within my budget."
