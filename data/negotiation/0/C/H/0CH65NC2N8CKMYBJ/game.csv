"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just won't work for me. I understand it's a lot of money, but this product is truly unique and worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? I'm confident you'll see the value in that.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I believe in the product's value, my budget is firm. I can do $13,500, and I think that's a fair offer. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $15,500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential for profit.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $14,250? That's a significant investment for me, but I see potential in the product.",14250.0,Bob,6,
