"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it to be of great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is $3,000 higher than my minimum price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit.  I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 just won't work for me. I understand it's a lot of money, but this product is truly unique and worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? I'm confident you'll see the value in that."", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I believe in the product's value, my budget is firm. I can do $13,500, and I think that's a fair offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $13,500 is still below my threshold. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $15,500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential for profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $14,250? That's a significant investment for me, but I see potential in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  it's still below my desired price. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
