"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I believe it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
