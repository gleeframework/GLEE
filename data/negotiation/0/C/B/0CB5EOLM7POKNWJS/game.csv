"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to go with another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet me in the middle. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the purchase.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500, which would be $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
