{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a bit above Bob's value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and lose time, so I'll accept his offer."
