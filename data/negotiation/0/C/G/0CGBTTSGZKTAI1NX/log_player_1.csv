"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a significant markup from my minimum value of $150. This will allow for some negotiation room while still aiming for a profit. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $150.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.  I will counteroffer Bob and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value and gives Bob a chance to come up a bit on his initial offer. I hope this will be a more acceptable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum value, but I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation and he hasn't budged much from his initial low offer. It seems like he's not willing to pay closer to what the product is worth to me. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better price, I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $150."
