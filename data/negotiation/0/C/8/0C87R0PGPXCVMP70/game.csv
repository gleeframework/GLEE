"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price needs to come down quite a bit to work for me. How about we start the conversation at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for.",850000.0,Alice,5,

This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a bit higher than your previous offer.",925000.0,Alice,7,
