"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
