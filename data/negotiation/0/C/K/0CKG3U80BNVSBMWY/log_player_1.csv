Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  To that end, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation. It signals that we believe in the product's value and are seeking a premium price.  
* **Confident and collaborative tone:** The message aims to be positive and open to discussion, fostering a collaborative atmosphere rather than an adversarial negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We should be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price. However, with a solid backup plan (selling to John), we are in a strong position."
