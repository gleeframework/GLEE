Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed $150 from John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $125 offers a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) while still being potentially attractive compared to unknown market alternatives. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
