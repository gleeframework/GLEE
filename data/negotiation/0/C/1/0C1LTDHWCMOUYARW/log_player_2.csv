* **You have a backup option:**  John is willing to sell for $1,500,000, giving you a safety net.

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

* **Tests the waters:**  This initial offer will give you an idea of Alice's willingness to negotiate."

* **Testing the waters:**  This offer will help gauge Alice's willingness to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price:**  Her offer is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  You're nearing the end of the negotiation, and there's a risk that Alice might become more resistant to further concessions.
* **Backup option:**  While John is still available, you're getting a good deal compared to his price. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiations."
