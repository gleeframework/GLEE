"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, but I still have time to potentially squeeze out a bit more.  I'll reject his offer for now and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about $160? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still aiming to keep within my budget. Would $140 be too low for you to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher offer from him. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next few rounds, but I'm keeping ""Sell to John"" as a safe option in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a middle ground. I'd like to counter with $150, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value and I've already rejected a few offers that were slightly lower. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
