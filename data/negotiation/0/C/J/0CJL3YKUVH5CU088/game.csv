"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're close, but I still think $1,320,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let's see if we can meet at $1,320,000.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
