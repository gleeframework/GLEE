"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $150. I can do $220, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $220 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $180 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",180.0,Bob,4,,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,185.0
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $195, but I can only do $185. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $185?",185.0,Bob,8,,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $192.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",192.5,Alice,9,,
