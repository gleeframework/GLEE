{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to close the gap. He's still hoping to get a lower price, but he's also acknowledging the risk of losing the deal if he doesn't make a significant move.  He can still buy from John for $1,000,000 if necessary, providing him with a safety net."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now asking for a price that's higher than Bob's limit. He has only one round left and  is not sure if he can get a better deal from Alice.  With only one round remaining, there's a significant risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be left with no deal. 

To guarantee he gets the product and stays within his budget, Bob decides to buy from John.  This ensures he gets the product for the lowest price, even if it means sacrificing a potential lower price from Alice."
