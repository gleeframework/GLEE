"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $10,000. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being slightly more affordable. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $12,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $13,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
