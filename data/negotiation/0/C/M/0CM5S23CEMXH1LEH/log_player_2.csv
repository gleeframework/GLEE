"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While I could try to get the price lower, $140 is already a significant savings compared to John's offer of $150. It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing it."
