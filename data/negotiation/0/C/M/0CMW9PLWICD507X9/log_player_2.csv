"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that's sure to appreciate in value over time. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the price you're willing to pay. You can likely negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $950,000 is significantly below my initial expectations. Given its potential value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to meet your price of $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate a better price.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice rather than immediately going to John, as his price is much higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $1150000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now within a range that is reasonable for you.  While you could try to negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately going back to her initial offer is high. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than John's.  It's also worth noting that you're in round 5, meaning time is running out."
