"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that's sure to appreciate in value over time. I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $950000 is significantly below my initial expectations. Given its potential value, I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to meet your price of $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $1150000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
