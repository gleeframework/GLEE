{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's reasonably close to Bob's value, but still gives me some room for negotiation.  If he rejects it, I can lower the price slightly in future counteroffers, keeping in mind that I won't accept anything below $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price, as I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $130 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my desired price point.  While I could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely he won't budge further, and I risk losing the sale completely.  It's better to secure the sale now and ensure a decent profit."
