"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I think it's worth $150 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't let it go for anything less than $120. How about we split the difference and you can have it for $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
