Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, I've potentially left money on the table. If he counteroffers, I know he's interested but wants a lower price.
* **Backup Option (John):** I always have the option to sell to John for $100. This knowledge gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's willingness to counter means he's interested, so I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle while still staying above my $100 floor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $105 price point ensures I still make a profit and stay above my $100 minimum. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** By suggesting a specific price (""meet in the middle""), I'm encouraging Bob to accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $95 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunities. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, which can be beneficial for future interactions."
