"Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows us both to walk away with a beneficial deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $2,000,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you've stated and my budget constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
