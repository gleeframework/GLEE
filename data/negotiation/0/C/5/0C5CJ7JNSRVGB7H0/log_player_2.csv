"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a more realistic price and potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows us both to walk away with a beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than your budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue exploring lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $2,000,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you've stated and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
