I'm still not sure if I can go up to $110. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle?,95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $98. I can do $102, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product and I think it's worth every penny.",102.0,Alice,7,
