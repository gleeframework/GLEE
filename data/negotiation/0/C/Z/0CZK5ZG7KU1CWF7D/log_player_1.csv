Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to sell it for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $110 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $115?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $112.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I need to get a little bit more for the product. How about $113.75? This would be a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 113.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to go down to $111.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not willing to go below $112.5.  This is a good product, and I'm confident I can find a buyer who's willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're determined to get a good price, but $111.50 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $112.00. It's the best I can do, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.00}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to meet you at $110, and that's my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I've already made multiple counteroffers. I don't want to waste any more time on this. I'm going to sell to John for $120.  It's not the highest price I hoped for, but it's still a good deal and I don't want to risk Bob continuing to lowball me."
