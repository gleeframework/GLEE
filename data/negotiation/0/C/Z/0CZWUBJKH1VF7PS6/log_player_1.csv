Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Alice could choose a different starting price based on her risk tolerance and how confident she is in John's guaranteed offer."
