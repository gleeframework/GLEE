"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good deal compared to John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  It's still a good price for you and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $110**, which is still within Bob's budget of $120.
* **Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again risks Alice walking away.** There's no guarantee she'll budge further.
* **Buying from John for $120 is more expensive.**

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the deal altogether."
