Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is framed as a conversation starter to gauge Bob's interest level. His response will provide insights into how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning that you'll offer it to another buyer (John) if Bob rejects the offer creates a subtle sense of urgency and scarcity. 

By starting at $10,000, Alice leaves room to potentially:

* **Secure a higher profit:** Bob might accept the initial offer or negotiate down to a price still above $8,000.
* **Meet in the middle:** If Bob counters, Alice can negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price, knowing her minimum is secure.
 
This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still respecting Bob's position and potentially leading to a successful sale."
