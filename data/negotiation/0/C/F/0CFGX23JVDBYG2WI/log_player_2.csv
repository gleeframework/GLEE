"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. After careful consideration, I am extending an offer to you to purchase this product at a special price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its true value, and I am confident it will be a wise investment for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer, and we can arrange the details accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. 

You have the fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000, but it's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price first."
