"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,4,
