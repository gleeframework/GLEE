Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However,  $875,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  I'm proposing $700,000, which reflects a substantial increase on my end, moving us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** We are getting close, but Bob is still moving in relatively small increments.  We need to signal that our price is firming up while leaving room for one more counter."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $762,500.  This demonstrates my serious interest while staying within reasonable limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $762,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to meet our desired price. He's sticking to smaller increments and trying to find the exact midpoint. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, which is better than Bob's current offer and saves us further negotiation time."
