"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob and using positive language to create a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  I'm explicitly inviting Bob's feedback and indicating a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Potentially Secure a High Price:** There's a slim chance Bob accepts this initial high offer. 
* **Establish a Strong Starting Point:** Even if he rejects it, we've set a high anchor for subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his counter-offer was expected after my high initial offer, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John for my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point.  However, I believe this product can be a great asset to your specific needs, so I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer stands as a sign of my commitment to working with you."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Competition:**  By mentioning another buyer at a higher price, I'm creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might prompt Bob to increase his offer more readily.
* **Justification:** I'm not just dismissing his offer outright but explaining why it's not acceptable while reiterating my belief in the product's value for him.
* **Significant Price Drop, But Above Minimum:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by dropping the price significantly from my initial offer. However, I remain well above my absolute minimum ($1,500,000) and closer to my target selling price.
* **Limited-Time Offer:** Phrasing it as ""this offer stands"" subtly implies it might not be on the table indefinitely, further encouraging a quicker decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, that's still a bigger investment than I can justify right now.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I feel that's a very fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than both my initial ask and my desired outcome.  It's clear he's interested, but I need to maintain a firm stance to maximize my profit. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price that moves us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement while still leaving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a final offer, as I need to make a decision soon due to other commitments. "",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to the middle ground between our previous positions. However, I'm also clearly stating this is a final offer, creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth.
* **Justification:**  I'm vaguely mentioning ""other commitments"" to imply a time constraint without revealing my guaranteed offer from John. This adds weight to the ""final offer"" statement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is above my absolute minimum, allowing some buffer for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By presenting a firm stance and a reasonable price, I'm encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer and make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $1,200,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, but I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his absolute maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob has been clear that he cannot go any higher. 
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
