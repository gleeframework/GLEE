Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it will be very valuable for you, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price closer to your own valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing the price"" signals to Bob that you might be willing to lower the price, making him more likely to engage. 
* **Balancing profit and risk:**  Offering the product at $9,500 creates a good balance:
    * **High potential profit:** If Bob accepts, you make a significant profit over his perceived value.
    * **Minimized risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
