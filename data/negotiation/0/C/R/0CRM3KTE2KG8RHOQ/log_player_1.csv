"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic approach to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm suggesting the product is valuable without revealing too much about its specifics. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at this price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if I show some willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm also not walking away. I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** My counter-offer is in the middle of my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlight Value Again:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Selling to John is a safer option:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, selling to John for $8,000 guarantees I meet my minimum and avoids further negotiation risk. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing more time with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be very satisfied with the product. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is likely my last counter-offer before considering selling to John.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""finalize"" and ""let's"" to imply a sense of finality and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Confidence:** I'm reaffirming my belief in the product's value to bolster my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer means taking a lower price than I initially wanted.  Selling to John guarantees a safe and reliable $8,000.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  I'm concerned that further negotiations could lead to a stalemate where neither of us is willing to budge, resulting in a failed deal.

With only four rounds left, it's strategically safer to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
