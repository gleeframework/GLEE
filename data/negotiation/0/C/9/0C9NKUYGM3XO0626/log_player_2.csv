"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, but she's offering it for $120. This is already too high for you, and you're aiming for a price below $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still give us both a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If we can reach a deal at this price, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You're very close to your goal of getting the product for under $80. Alice is coming down, but you can still get a better deal. Keep negotiating!"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about $92? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm getting the feeling we're both really close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $97.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a great way for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering a price of $97, which is still higher than your target of under $80. You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and you're close to your goal, but it seems unlikely you'll get a lower price from Alice. It's better to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for $80. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
