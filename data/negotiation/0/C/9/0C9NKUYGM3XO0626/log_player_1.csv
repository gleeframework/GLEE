"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value might make Bob more willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome.  However, I'm aiming for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle. I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still give us both a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $105 is still a good price for me, considering my minimum is $100.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  A positive message reinforces that I'm willing to compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer.  If he doesn't, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'll be more prepared to sell to John in the next few rounds if we can't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If we can reach a deal at this price, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further rounds.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $100 is a secure option, but I'm aiming for a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't produce a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum.
* **Close to Minimum:** $95 is just $5 below my minimum, which is a good compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using a slightly more urgent tone to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer is my final compromise. If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell to John in the next round. I want to see if we can reach a deal, but I'm not going to lower my price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about $92? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:**  $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's still not quite there.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob is willing to go higher, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my target with one more counteroffer.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I'm still hopeful for a slightly higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for $97, which is a compromise, but still slightly above my minimum.  If Bob rejects that, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm getting the feeling we're both really close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $97.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a great way for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $97 is a final compromise, just $3 below my minimum. 
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message emphasizes this is my final offer and uses language like ""getting the feeling we're close"" to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This is my final push for a slightly better price. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John in the next round.  I'm confident that this offer is fair and appealing to Bob, considering how close we are to a deal."
