Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with my highest possible price. I know the product is worth at least this much to me, and Bob has to be willing to pay at least $1,000,000 to make it worthwhile for him. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my bottom line, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that Bob will find it attractive enough to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
