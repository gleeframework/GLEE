"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $95 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to get the product without going over my limit.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
