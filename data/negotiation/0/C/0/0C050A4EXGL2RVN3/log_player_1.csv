Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, indicating flexibility.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm not willing to accept such a significant reduction yet.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your business, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway with a price that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob and the win-win nature of the compromise.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate further by suggesting a compromise rather than immediately rejecting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within a tighter budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $130? This would allow me to make a purchase while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  While I could try to counter-offer again,  the likelihood of getting a higher price is low.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate but is firm on his budget. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower profit. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It guarantees a sale and secures a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
