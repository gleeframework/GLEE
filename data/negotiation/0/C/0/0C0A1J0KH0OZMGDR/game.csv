"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable asset, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This offer reflects its value to me while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
