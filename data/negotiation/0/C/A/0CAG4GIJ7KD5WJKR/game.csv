"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $13,000 is still a little below what I need, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This way, we both get a good deal and can move forward.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $13,500 is the best fit for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,6,
