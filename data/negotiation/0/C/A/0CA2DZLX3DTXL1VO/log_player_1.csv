Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my ideal price, as it's the price John is willing to pay. Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate, but I'm confident in the value of my product.  Let's see what he proposes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm reducing my price by $100,000 from my initial offer. This is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth it to me. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm offering a compromise at $1,050,000. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come up just a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and I'm getting tired of the back and forth.  While $980,000 is tempting, it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. John is offering me my ideal price, and I'm going to take it."
