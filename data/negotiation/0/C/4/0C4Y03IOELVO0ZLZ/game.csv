"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $135. It's a fair price for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  I'm open to discussing it further if needed.",135.0,Alice,5,
