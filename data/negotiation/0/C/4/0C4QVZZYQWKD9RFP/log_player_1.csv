Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your $8,000 floor, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  $12,000 is lower than Bob's $15,000 valuation, making the offer attractive to him. 
* **It signals a willingness to negotiate:**  By not asking for the full $15,000, you show Bob you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 (John's offer), it's still far below what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for potentially getting closer to the $12,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $11,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
