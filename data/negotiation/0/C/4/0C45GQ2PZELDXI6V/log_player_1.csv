"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in! I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Direct Offer:**  Clearly stating the price and asking for his opinion sets a direct and efficient tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I'm aiming for more than my minimum value of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if there's room to increase the price even slightly. 
* **Potential for Higher:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more, and I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Profit:**  I'm highlighting the profit aspect to make it clear that I'm not just accepting any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given it some thought and am willing to increase my offer to $8,300. This is still within my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $300 below my minimum desired price.
* **Limited Time:**  We are already in Round 4, leaving fewer opportunities for a higher offer. 
* **Risk of John:**  Selling to John at $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's unlikely I can get a better offer from Bob with limited time remaining. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of a longer negotiation process and potentially lower offers outweighs the potential gain of $300."
