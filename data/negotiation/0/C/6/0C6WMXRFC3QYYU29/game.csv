"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping we can find a price that works a bit better for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $850,000. I believe it's worth more to me than that, and I'm hoping we can find a price that's closer to its true value. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and my original offer of $900,000. How about we try $825,000 again?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're close, but I need you to come down a bit more for this to work for me.  Would you consider $775,000?  This is my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $825,000. How about we try $800,000?",800000.0,Alice,7,
