"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I've set a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, allowing for room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1000000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $750000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000. 
* **I have time and options.** I can reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, or I can sell to John for $800,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for us to meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the price I'm asking for.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm highlighting that $900,000 allows for further negotiation, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the conversation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and meet at $825000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or his offer might decrease in subsequent rounds.
* **Time and Risk:** It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk losing Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
