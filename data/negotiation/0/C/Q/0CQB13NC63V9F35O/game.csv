"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1000000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $750000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for us to meet in the middle. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and meet at $825000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.",825000.0,Bob,4,
