"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a price closer to $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $722,500. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $722,500 is very close to my counteroffer of $712,500. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm confident I'm getting a good price considering the product's value to me. Accepting the offer saves me $77,500 compared to buying from John."
