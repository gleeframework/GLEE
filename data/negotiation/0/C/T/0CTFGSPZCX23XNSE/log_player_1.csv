"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that the product is worth more to Bob.  This will give me room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I can likely get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above what Bob offered. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I want, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  There's a good chance I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
