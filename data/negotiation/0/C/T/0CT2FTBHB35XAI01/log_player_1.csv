Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth the same to both Alice and Bob, starting with a high offer maximizes potential profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter, allowing Alice to potentially still secure a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to sell to Bob for less than that amount.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. In a real-world scenario, more back-and-forth negotiation would likely occur."
