"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's clear she's starting from a point of trying to get much more than you value the product for. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a price closer to $5,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a very low offer ($5,000), I'm setting an anchor that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This might make her more receptive to a compromise in the middle.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left a significant gap between my offer and my maximum price ($8,000). This allows me to negotiate upwards if needed without immediately hitting my limit.
* **Direct Communication:** I'm clearly stating that her initial offer is unacceptable and providing a specific counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $10,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further, aiming to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so it's worth pushing further towards your target price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By offering $7,000, you're splitting the difference between her current offer ($10,000) and your previous offer ($5,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to your goal. 
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** Offering $7,000 keeps you below your maximum budget of $8,000, leaving you some room for a potential final concession if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit of a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $9,000 is the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now down to $9,000, which is closer to your budget, but still above your absolute limit of $8,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are small, and there's a risk Alice might dig in her heels. It's not worth the risk of missing out on the product entirely, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal from John."
