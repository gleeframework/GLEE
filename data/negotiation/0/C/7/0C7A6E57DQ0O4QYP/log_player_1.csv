Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $150 gives us some room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes our willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested. 
* **The $120 Floor:**  We're comfortable walking away and selling to John, so we won't accept anything less than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is exactly our minimum acceptable price.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** We'd get the same amount selling to John, but there's no guarantee John will still be interested if we reject Bob's offer. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer means a quick and guaranteed sale."
