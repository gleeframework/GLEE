Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1,025,000 is my final offer. What do you think?

Alice is clearly very attached to that $1,000,000 mark. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Taking the $1,025,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of her backing out completely."
