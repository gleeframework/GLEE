"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. This is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
