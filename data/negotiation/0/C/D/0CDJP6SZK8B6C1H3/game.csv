"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. However, I'm open to some flexibility. How about we meet at $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,220,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we settle at $1,160,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1160000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,160,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,220,000 and $1,160,000, which would be $1,190,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",1190000.0,Alice,5,
