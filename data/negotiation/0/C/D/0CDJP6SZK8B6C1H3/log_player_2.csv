Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. However, I'm open to some flexibility. How about we meet at $1,220,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,160,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,220,000 and $1,160,000, which would be $1,190,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly negotiating and willing to compromise. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, $1,190,000 is a solid deal and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
