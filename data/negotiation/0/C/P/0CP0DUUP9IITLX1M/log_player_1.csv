"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential concessions without sacrificing too much.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing and encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if Bob is willing to budge.
* **Selling to John is a Better Option Right Now:** While selling to John would be the most lucrative, I want to explore negotiation with Bob further. If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation but still value the product highly.
* **Justification:**  I'm justifying the price with a statement about the value of the product and the discount already offered. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially accept the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my ideal selling price and closer to what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm not ready to settle at this point.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** I can always sell to John for a higher price if negotiation with Bob fails. However, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm prepared to go down to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession to show good faith but not giving away too much. 
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm reiterating that this price is still fair based on the value of the product.
* **Closing Language:**  I'm using language that emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, which would be $862,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $862,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range and closer to Bob's initial lowball offer.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is the Safer Option:** This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm still inclined to see if I can get closer to my desired price, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, $862,500 is still a bit too low for me given the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $865,000 as a final compromise.  Let's close this deal at this fair price."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession, only $2,500 lower than Bob's offer, showing I'm committed to closing the deal. 
* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""final compromise,"" putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Direct Close:** I'm directly asking Bob to ""close the deal"" to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $825,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's message indicates a stalemate, as he's unwilling to go higher. 
* **Time Running Out:**  We're approaching the final rounds of negotiation.  
* **John Offers the Best Price:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable value and a much better deal than what Bob is offering.  It's the most financially beneficial option at this point."
