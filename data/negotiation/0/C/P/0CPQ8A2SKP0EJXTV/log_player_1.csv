Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than $80, giving Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It shows you're willing to be flexible while still aiming for a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy based on his reaction!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While it's tempting to take $60, it's far below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85 which is:

* **Still above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but is significantly closer to my desired price.
* **Above my minimum:** This ensures I still make a profit. 
* **A reasonable compromise:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also aiming for a fair price.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
