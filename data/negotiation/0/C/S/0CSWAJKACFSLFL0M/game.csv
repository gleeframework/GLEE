"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, but I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $18000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe the product's value is worth it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18000 is closer to my range, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's split the difference - how about $14000? I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $18000. How about $16000? It's a fair compromise that still recognizes the product's value, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $13000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you halfway between $13000 and $16000. How about $14500? It's a fair price that still recognizes the product's value, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options.",13500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $13500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you halfway between $13500 and $16000. How about $14750? It's a fair price that still recognizes the product's value, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement. However, if we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",14750.0,Alice,9,
