Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than his initial value, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to that price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.50. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $88.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $120.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $88.50 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $90? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
