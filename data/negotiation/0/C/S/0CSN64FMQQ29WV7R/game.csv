"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100. That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $102.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",102.5,Alice,5,
