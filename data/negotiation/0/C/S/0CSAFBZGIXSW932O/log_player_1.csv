"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage him to make a higher counteroffer."
