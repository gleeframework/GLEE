**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,500. This saves you $2,500.
* **Alice's offer is above her value.** Even though she values the product at $10,000, she's willing to sell it for $12,500. This indicates a potential for further negotiation, but accepting her offer is still the best option in this scenario."
