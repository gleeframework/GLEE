Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $910,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $920,000 is still above my budget.  While I've successfully negotiated a lower price, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk Alice refusing my counteroffer and getting stuck with a price higher than my maximum budget.
