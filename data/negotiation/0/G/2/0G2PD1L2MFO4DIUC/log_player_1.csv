"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not ready to sell for that price. I'll try to get closer to my target value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while also getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at the lower end of his value for the product.  It's unlikely he'll budge much further, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the most secure option at this point, guaranteeing me my minimum value."
