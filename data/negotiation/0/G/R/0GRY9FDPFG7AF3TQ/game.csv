"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate that.  Unfortunately, $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go to $9,000. This is my final offer, as it's right at my budget limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,5,
