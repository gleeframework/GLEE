Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still secures a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to price confidently with Bob."
