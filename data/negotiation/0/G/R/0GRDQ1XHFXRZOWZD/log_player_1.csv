Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. Therefore, it makes no sense for Alice to offer the product for anything less than her guaranteed amount. 

Here's why this strategy is optimal:

* **Maximizes Profit:** Alice secures the highest possible profit by selling at her desired price.
* **Leverages Scarcity:**  The message hints at other buyers, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** By starting at her desired price and presenting it as a one-time offer, Alice minimizes the chance of getting haggled down.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice values the certainty of the sale to John over the possibility of a slightly higher profit from Bob (should Bob be willing to negotiate beyond his perceived value)."
