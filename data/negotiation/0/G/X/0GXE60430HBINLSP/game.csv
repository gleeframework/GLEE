"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a fair offer, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit off. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant jump on my end and meets you closer to the middle.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
