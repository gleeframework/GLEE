"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as a ""fair price,"" it matches the absolute maximum you're willing to pay and the exact value it holds for her. There's no negotiation advantage for you in accepting this offer.  

By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be motivated to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. If she doesn't, you haven't lost anything â€“ you can still buy from John at the same price."
