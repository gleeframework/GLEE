"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do want to let you know that I'm looking for a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still potentially get a better deal. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $980,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still significantly higher than what he's comfortable paying. 
* **Limited rounds:**  Bob only has a few rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time without securing a better deal.
* **John's price is guaranteed:** John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed price within Bob's budget. This provides a safe and efficient way to get the product.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the secure option from John rather than risk further negotiations with Alice."
