"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I do want to let you know that I'm looking for a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's finalize the deal at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",980000.0,Alice,5,
