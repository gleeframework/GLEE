"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, so there is room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your target. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than your budget. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer to buy the product for $800,000.  This is the best deal you can get, as further negotiation with Alice doesn't seem promising."
