"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal today if you're willing to meet me at $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
