"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about $1,125,000?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing this product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about purchasing the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
