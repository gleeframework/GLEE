Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about purchasing the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. However, I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, let me know, and we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice has met her lowest price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well within Bob's budget.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal."
