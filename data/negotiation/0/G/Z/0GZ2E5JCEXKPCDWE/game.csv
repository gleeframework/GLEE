"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $150 is a bit high, but I can't go as low as $100. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $110 is closer, but I still need to cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle! If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other offers.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $120. Can you meet me there?",120.0,Bob,6,
