{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it also gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for your product. This price aligns better with my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,500? This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what others would pay for this product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, $10,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I get the best possible price."
