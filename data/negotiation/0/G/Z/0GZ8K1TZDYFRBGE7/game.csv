"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the initial price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer and a significant compromise considering its value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
