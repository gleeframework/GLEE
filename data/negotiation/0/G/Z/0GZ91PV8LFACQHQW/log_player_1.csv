"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee I'd get a higher price. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
