Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since you expressed interest. I think it would be a great value for you at $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your minimum acceptable price is met. You should aim for the highest possible price Bob might accept. 
* **Avoid Haggling:**  Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) might lead to unnecessary back-and-forth. A slightly higher initial offer can save time and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $100 is ideal, the message implies there's some wiggle room if Bob pushes back. This allows for potential negotiation without appearing desperate."
