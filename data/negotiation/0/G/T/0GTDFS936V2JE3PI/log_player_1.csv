Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. My starting offer is $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's closer to what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm firm at $1250000. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still slightly below. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,300,000 at this point.  I have several rounds remaining and am confident I can secure a better deal with continued negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1275000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,300,000. I have four rounds remaining, and I believe I can still push for a better price. It's not yet worth risking a sale to John for $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,287,500. This is a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1287500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1287500 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm firm at $1250000, which is a fair price considering our previous negotiations and my budget.  Let's come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer hasn't gone above my minimum. I am concerned that Bob may not be willing to compromise further.  Given the time constraint and the risk of not reaching an agreement, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm still getting a significant amount of money for the product.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk getting a lower offer or no sale at all."
