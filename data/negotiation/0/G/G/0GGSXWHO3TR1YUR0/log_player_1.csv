Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but it is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). This strategy is aimed at maximizing my chances of getting Bob to accept the offer while still getting a decent price. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
