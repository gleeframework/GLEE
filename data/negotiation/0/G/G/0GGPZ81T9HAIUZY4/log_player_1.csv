{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from your minimum price, making it attractive to Bob.  

By leaving room for negotiation, we open the door for a potential win-win situation. We'll see what Bob's counteroffer is and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than our desired price. We'll reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $9,800 is getting closer to our desired price, it's still below our minimum. We'll reject this offer and try to get a better price with another counteroffer."
