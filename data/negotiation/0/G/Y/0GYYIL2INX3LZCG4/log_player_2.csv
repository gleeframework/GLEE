"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly above your budget. You have plenty of room to negotiate and should try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below your actual budget gives you room to negotiate upwards.  Alice might be motivated to avoid lengthy negotiations and accept a price closer to your counter-offer than her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $17,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice lowered her price considerably, which suggests she's willing to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still above your $15,000 walk-away point. There's room to negotiate further towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on. To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere around there?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Honesty:** By revealing your budget is closer to $12,000, you establish a sense of transparency and urgency.  
* **Compromise:** You're signaling willingness to compromise by moving significantly closer to her $17,000 offer.
* **Target Range:** This counter-offer puts you in a good position to potentially settle within your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle on $14,500?  That's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to your maximum budget. However, you're aiming to save as much as possible. It's worth seeing if she'll budge a little more, bringing the price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000 even? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that suggests fairness and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  You're holding your ground while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  As you approach the later rounds, Alice might be more inclined to accept to avoid losing the sale."
