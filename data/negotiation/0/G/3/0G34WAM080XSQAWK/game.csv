"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8000 is a significant discount from my initial offer.  However,  $8000 is far too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of your product, but $10000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
