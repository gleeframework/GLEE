Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to close the deal, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 just doesn't work for me. How about $95? It's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $90 as the price for the product. This would allow us to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a decent compromise, and it's still above my minimum threshold."
