"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'll accept $850,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from it.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and saves me a considerable amount.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $825,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's a significant increase from your previous offer while still leaving you with a substantial profit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
