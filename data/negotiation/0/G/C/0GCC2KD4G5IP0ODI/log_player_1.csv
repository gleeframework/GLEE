Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a tough pill to swallow. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with a different option.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John and avoid the risk of Bob walking away."
