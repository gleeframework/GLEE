"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product is valuable, but not at that level for my needs.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000?  This acknowledges the value while recognizing your initial feedback.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents value, but we're still quite far apart. To move things along, I could go up to $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. However, we need to make a more significant move towards a realistic price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my bottom line, reflecting its absolute minimum value.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a tough pill to swallow. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with a different option.",800000.0,Bob,6,
