"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000?  This acknowledges the value while recognizing your initial feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I want to find a solution that works for us both. However, we need to make a more significant move towards a realistic price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my bottom line, reflecting its absolute minimum value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down considerably, she's now at her stated ""bottom line."" This likely means future concessions from her will be small.  Since we have several rounds left and a significant gap remains between her offer and our alternative (John at $800,000), it's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a tough pill to swallow. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with a different option."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:**  We're now offering Alice the same amount we'd pay John. This sets a clear signal that we're not willing to go higher.
* **Firm but Polite:** The message is firm that this is our limit but remains respectful and avoids any threats.  
* **Time Constraint:** While we have rounds left, subtly introducing the time constraint (""different option"") might push Alice to accept, knowing we have alternatives."
