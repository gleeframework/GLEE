"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially leads to a higher final sale price.  
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $2,200,000, we establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. This can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Leaving Room:** While we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to us (and we have John as a backup), starting high gives us room to negotiate down if necessary, while still exceeding our minimum.

This first offer sets a strong initial point in the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly more than I'm able to pay. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both our asking price and our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a better deal. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,850,000. This offer reflects a more realistic assessment of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Somewhat):** We've come down significantly from our initial offer to signal flexibility. However, we're still above Bob's offer by a considerable margin, aiming to keep the negotiation moving in our favor. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value proposition, focusing on its potential return on investment.  This reinforces why our price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By proposing $1,850,000, we are aiming for a price point where we can still negotiate down slightly if needed, while staying well above our $1,500,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective perspectives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's still substantially below our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary to get a deal closer to our target. We'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to see movement towards a more realistic price point. To be clear, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. Let me know if you're prepared to move closer to that figure."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We're taking a firmer stance this round, clearly stating our unwillingness to go below $1,600,000. This establishes a stronger bottom line and signals our seriousness.
* **Direct Communication:** We're directly addressing the price disparity and emphasizing the need for Bob to make a more substantial move.
* **Maintaining Some Flexibility:** While firm, we're still offering room for negotiation by not outright rejecting his offer and inviting him to move closer to our price. 

This approach aims to encourage a more serious counteroffer from Bob while demonstrating that we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine desire to make this deal happen. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 considering we would need to give a portion of our earnings to the government as tax. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to Bob entirely."
