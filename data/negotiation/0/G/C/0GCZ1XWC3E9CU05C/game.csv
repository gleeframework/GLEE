"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to move a little higher, but $1,400,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's try $1,250,000 â€“ it's a fair offer that reflects the potential of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm recognizing the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
