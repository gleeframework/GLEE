"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than the $150 from John, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is offering significantly lower than Alice's initial offer,  but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($100). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within Bob's budget.
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a reason (""a bit high for me"") makes the offer more personal and less aggressive. 
* **Open to discussion:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Alice to counter and keeps the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $115 is a reasonable middle ground. 
* **Within budget:** The price is still within Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Saving money:** Accepting the offer saves Bob $35 compared to buying from John. 

While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is present. Accepting the offer secures a good deal within the constraints of the game."
