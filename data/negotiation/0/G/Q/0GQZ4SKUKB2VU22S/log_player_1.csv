"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This initial offer allows room for negotiation while still reflecting the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm. I believe $1,400,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility. At this point, I'm willing to accept a smaller profit to secure the deal. I believe $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise and a fair price for both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm  lowering the price by a small amount to show my willingness to compromise, but this is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of this product and accept my offer.  If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't changed, and I've reached the end of my negotiation flexibility.  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's time to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."
