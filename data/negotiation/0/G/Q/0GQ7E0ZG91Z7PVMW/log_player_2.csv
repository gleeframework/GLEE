"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than he'd ideally want ($8,000), but it's a significant step down from Alice's offer. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and allows some room for compromise without exceeding Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to the $8,000 mark. There's still room for compromise and Bob may be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $8,500. He's showing that he's serious about this price and isn't willing to budge further. This might encourage Alice to reconsider her position and potentially come closer to Bob's desired price. It's important to remember that Bob is still within his budget with this offer, so there's no pressure to raise it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  It's a fair price considering our previous offers and the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  Bob is still within his budget and has the option of buying from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $9,000.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground by splitting the difference between Alice's offer and his previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  By offering $9,000, Bob is increasing the chances of reaching an agreement without risking too much."
