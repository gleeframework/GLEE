"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but the product is worth significantly more to me. Could you meet me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd still get a good deal, and I'd be able to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
