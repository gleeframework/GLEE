# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its significant value.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,400,000 from Alice, compared to $1,500,000 from John.
* **You're still saving money.**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and you're getting it for less."
