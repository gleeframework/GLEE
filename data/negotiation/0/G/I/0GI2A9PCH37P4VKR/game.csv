"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tighter than you mentioned, and I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your enthusiasm for this product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting closer to the $1,000,000 mark.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I've invested in the product while providing you with a very competitive deal. Let's work together to finalize this mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'm thinking of $925,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that balances our interests. I'm eager to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
