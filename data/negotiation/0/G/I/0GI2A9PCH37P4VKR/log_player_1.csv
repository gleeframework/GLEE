Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, my budget is a bit tighter than you mentioned, and I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'm thinking of $925,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that balances our interests. I'm eager to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.
