"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming less flexible.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal."
