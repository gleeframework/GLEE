Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point, hopefully high enough to be enticing to Bob but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net, so I won't go below that.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to get as much as possible, I'm definitely not willing to sell for $8,000. That's significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still well above Bob's offer but lower than my initial price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable price, but I'm also keeping John's $15,000 offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm not ready to give up yet.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm countering with $13,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a healthy margin above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also not willing to give away too much.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'd love to get a better price, I've negotiated for a while and it seems unlikely that Bob will go much higher. I'm also running the risk of getting caught in a cycle of counteroffers and not reaching a deal at all. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $15,000."
