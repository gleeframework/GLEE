# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
