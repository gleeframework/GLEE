"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is still a fair price given its rarity. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1800000. This price still reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1800000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
