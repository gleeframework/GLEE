"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000. How about we try $800000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
