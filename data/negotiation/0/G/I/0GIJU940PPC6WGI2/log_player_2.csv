# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a premium support package. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, it's a good deal for Bob. The price is $450,000 lower than John's offer, and the added warranty and support package are valuable bonuses. It's time to close the deal."
