"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and try $1,400,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this transaction. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're trying to work within your budget, and I respect that.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I'm confident this will be a good investment for you.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
