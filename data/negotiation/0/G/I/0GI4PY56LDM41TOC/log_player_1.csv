"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Argument:**  I'm using a ""fairness"" argument to justify the price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,750,000 price point gives me a buffer to potentially negotiate down if necessary.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a high price.
* I need to consider the possibility that Bob might make a counteroffer, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.
* I also need to consider the possibility that I might need to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I don't want to price myself out of the market.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I might consider lowering the price slightly if Bob's response suggests he is unwilling to pay the initial price. 
* However, I will be mindful of my minimum acceptable price, which is $1,500,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob is clearly interested in the product, his offer is too low to accept at this point. I believe there is still room for negotiation.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired amount.

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* I have 9 rounds left and believe I can potentially reach a more profitable agreement with Bob.
* Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to earn more by negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob in the next round, taking into account his initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* I will aim for a price that is both appealing to Bob and profitable for me. 
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I will seriously consider selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial offer, but still well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also providing a justification for my counteroffer, referencing the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm coming down, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation in the event Bob doesn't accept this offer.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's initial offer.
* I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product, and I believe that there's a good chance he'll accept this counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob continues to offer prices below my minimum, I will seriously consider selling to John.
* However, I am still hopeful that I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, his offer is still too low. I believe there's still room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential Counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can reach a more favorable price, and I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

*  Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of profit.
* I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm determined to try and get a better deal. 
* While selling to John is always an option, I'm hoping to secure a higher price through negotiation.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and try $1,400,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is exactly in the middle between my previous counteroffer of $1,600,000 and Bob's last offer of $1,300,000. This shows a clear willingness to compromise.

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, while still showing flexibility to Bob.
* The middle ground approach is often effective in negotiations, as it appears fair and reasonable.
*  I'm adding a sense of urgency by mentioning closing the transaction, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely watch Bob's reaction to this offer.
* If he rejects again, I might need to consider a slight reduction to $1,350,000 in the next round, but I won't go lower than that.
