{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  There's a good chance she's willing to go lower, and we have 9 more rounds to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  We're still early in the process, and this aggressive move might push her towards a more reasonable price."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not convinced she's at her bottom line. I want to see if I can get her even lower."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still keeping it below her last offer.  I want to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still going to try to squeeze a bit more out of her. We have a few rounds left, and I don't want to miss out on potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount this time. I want to show Alice I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not going to overpay. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I'm hoping she'll accept this offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $330,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, we are close to the end and I need to consider the risk of not making a deal with Alice and going with Jhon.  I don't want to risk paying the full $1,000,000.  $330,000 is a good price for the product, and I'm happy to accept it."
