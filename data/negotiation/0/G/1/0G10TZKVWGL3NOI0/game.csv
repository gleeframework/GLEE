"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1000000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  Would you be interested in learning more? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. Given your stated value, I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to meet you halfway.  This price still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the value and leaves room for us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
