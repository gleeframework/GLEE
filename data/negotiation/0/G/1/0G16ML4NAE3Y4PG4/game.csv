"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,250,000 is simply too far from what I can accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you reconsider?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
