Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a profit on the product.

Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try to secure a slightly higher price. I'll hold firm on my valuation for one more round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,275,000. This price would allow me to make a decent profit and feel more comfortable with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible deal, but his offer is now acceptable. Accepting $1,275,000 provides a good profit margin and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
