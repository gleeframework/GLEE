"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $12,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to lower the price further. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's good to keep in mind, but it's not the best choice right now since it's more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It's still higher than Alice's estimated value, suggesting a potential middle ground.
* **Sets the tone:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about saving money and sets a lower price point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay.
* **More negotiation is possible.** You still have 7 rounds left, and there's room to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John remains a backup.** However, you're closer to a deal with Alice and can likely get a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer ($9500) and Alice's latest offer ($11,000).
* **Shows commitment:** Demonstrates your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Increases the chance of acceptance:** Alice has already reduced her price once; this counteroffer might be appealing enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:**  While you'd prefer a lower price, $10,500 is reasonably close to your initial counteroffer of $10,000.
* **Time is a factor:** You've already gone through several rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice changing her mind or you losing the deal altogether. 
* **Buying from John is still more expensive:**  It's a better option than buying from John, and you're likely to save a significant amount of money."
