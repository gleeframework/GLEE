"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, this product is in high demand, and I've had significant interest from other buyers. To make this work for me, I would need to see a price closer to $2,000,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product is in high demand, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
