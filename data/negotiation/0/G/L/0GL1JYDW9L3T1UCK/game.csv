"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given its value to me at $1,200,000, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a fair middle ground and ensures a profitable transaction for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully, as it's the highest I'm prepared to go.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
