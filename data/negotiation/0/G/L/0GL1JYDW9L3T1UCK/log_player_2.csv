Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, you can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price even lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a fair middle ground and ensures a profitable transaction for both of us. Please consider my offer carefully, as it's the highest I'm prepared to go."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You've already made several counteroffers and Alice isn't budging much.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John. You'll save $25,000 and avoid further negotiation."
