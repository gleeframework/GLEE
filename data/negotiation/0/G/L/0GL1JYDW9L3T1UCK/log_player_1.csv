Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given its value to me at $1,200,000, I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.
