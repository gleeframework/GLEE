Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on the price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions being ""open to hearing your thoughts on the price,"" signaling to Bob that there's flexibility. 
* **Justification:** While we don't want to reveal John's offer, implying that the product is desirable (""you'll really like"") might encourage Bob to pay a premium.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible approach. A more aggressive opener could be higher. 
* Bob's personality and negotiation style could influence your strategy.  If you knew he was very price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary."
