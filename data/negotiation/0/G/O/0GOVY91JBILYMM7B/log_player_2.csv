"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I know it's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110**, which is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $10** compared to buying from John.
* While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it."
