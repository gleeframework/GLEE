"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's potential to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $6,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $6,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. At $6,900, the offer is now closer to Bob's ideal price point.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's both favorable and within his budget. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
