"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I'm interested in purchasing the product for $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is too far below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still looking to keep my spending under $10,000. Could we perhaps aim for $10,000 as the final price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
