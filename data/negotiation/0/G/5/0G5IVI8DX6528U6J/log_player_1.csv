"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to capture some of the potential surplus. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential compromise and a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I'm interested in purchasing the product for $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. 

I'll proceed to the next round and try to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is too far below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Empathy:** Acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal shows I understand his perspective. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, suggesting that my offer is still fair considering the product's quality.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still looking to keep my spending under $10,000. Could we perhaps aim for $10,000 as the final price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting this offer is still a good deal for me. It's a win for both of us, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
