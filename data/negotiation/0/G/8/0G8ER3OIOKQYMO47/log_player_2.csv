"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but  $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to quickly find a compromise. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $12,500 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** Bob keeps the tone positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial offer, $13,250 is still above Bob's desired price range. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get a better price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Bob is still hesitant to buy from John, as Alice's offers are getting closer to his ideal price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $13,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is making a small increment to his previous offer, showing he's serious about finding a compromise.
