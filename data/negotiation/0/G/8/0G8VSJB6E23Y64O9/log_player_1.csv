Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.
