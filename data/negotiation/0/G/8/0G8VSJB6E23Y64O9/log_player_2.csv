"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price point.  He also has the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've already placed on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a decent compromise and significantly lower than her original offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice getting stubborn and sticking to her price, or even increasing it.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse deal.  It's better to secure the product at $875,000."
