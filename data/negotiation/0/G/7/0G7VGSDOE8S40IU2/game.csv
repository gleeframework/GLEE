"Alice, your product is definitely intriguing, but $1,350,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still outside of my comfortable price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This price ensures a good outcome for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity.  I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
