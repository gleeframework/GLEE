"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects the true value of this item. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is simply too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and in high demand.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $11,500? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
