Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob can incentivize him to negotiate rather than simply rejecting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and either accept if it's close to my target or make a new counteroffer. 
* I'll be mindful of John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 less than my initial offer and significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale. 

**Why not counter-offer?**

* **Time is money:** Negotiating further risks delaying the sale, potentially leading to a lower price or losing Bob's interest. 
* **Risk of deadlock:** Counter-offering might lead to a prolonged negotiation that could ultimately result in Bob rejecting my offer or choosing to buy elsewhere. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical and financially beneficial choice at this point."
