Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum valuation of the product. While accepting his offer gets us our minimum acceptable price, there's still room to push for a slightly higher price. We're not in a rush, so it's worth seeing if we can get closer to $1,100,000."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're open to discussion, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I can agree to $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very close to his maximum price. Accepting his offer of $1,025,000 is a solid deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away by continuing to negotiate for a potentially insignificant gain."
