{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but it's still below the value I place on the product. This allows room for negotiation and also signals the value I see in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while also emphasizing the value I see in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only $100,000 less than my counteroffer and is getting closer to my minimum.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  There's always a chance he'll walk away if I keep counter-offering."
