"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit and is closer to my value.  Let's make a deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
