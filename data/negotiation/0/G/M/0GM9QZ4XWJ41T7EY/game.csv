"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you consider $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and we could both walk away satisfied.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  While I appreciate your persistence, $8,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to offer one final compromise at $8,900. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
