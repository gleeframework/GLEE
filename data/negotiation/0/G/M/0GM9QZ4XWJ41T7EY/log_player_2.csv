You can do better than $9,500!  You can counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further."

Alice's offer:

You're still closer to John's price, so let's see if we can get Alice down a bit more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  While I appreciate your persistence, $8,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to offer one final compromise at $8,900. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is very close to your target price of $8,000.  It's worth it to accept this offer, as you're only paying $900 more than you would from John, and you avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again."
