"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll make a counteroffer of $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $11250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and my previous offer of $10000. I'll make a counteroffer of $10750. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",10750.0,Bob,6,
