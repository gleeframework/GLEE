"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves a good amount of room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe this is a fair starting point that might entice Bob to accept, while leaving me space to potentially negotiate upwards if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120 and what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a good profit margin for me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal. I'm confident that we can close the deal in the remaining rounds without resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm counteroffering at $108. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still ensuring I'm making a decent profit.  I believe this price is fair and might push Bob to accept, considering the limited rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining. I'm getting a decent profit and avoiding the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price.  It's time to close the deal."
