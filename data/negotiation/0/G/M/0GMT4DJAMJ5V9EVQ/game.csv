"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $500,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could we settle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still trying to get as close to the product's value as possible. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",650000.0,Alice,5,
