{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I've started with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate a bit more, the risk of him rejecting my offer and me potentially having to settle with John for $12,000 isn't worth it.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price for the product."
