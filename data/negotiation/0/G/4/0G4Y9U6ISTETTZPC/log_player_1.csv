Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider a counteroffer of $8,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Could you do $12,000? This product is truly top-notch and will provide you with significant value."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $10,000 is the most logical choice at this stage. It aligns with my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
