{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique and valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and my understanding of his perceived value of the product.  I'm aiming high initially, but I'm also prepared to negotiate and consider a deal with John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the maximum amount I am willing to spend. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's clear that Bob won't budge further.  $12,000 is a significant amount and is a much better deal than selling to John. It's time to finalize the sale and secure the profit."
