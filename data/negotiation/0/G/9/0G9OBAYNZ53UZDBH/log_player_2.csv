"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, so a price of $90 is too high. 
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting this offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to get the price as close to my maximum value of $100 as possible.
* I've started by offering a price that is $5 less than Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
*  I've included a message to make the counteroffer more personal and show that I'm interested in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. While she has come down from her initial offer, $92.50 is still too high. 
* I want to continue negotiating, so I'll reject the offer and make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm sticking to my goal of keeping the price below $90. 
* I've increased my offer from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get the best possible price.
* I've used a positive and encouraging message to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $90, which is right in the middle of my original offer and your last one. Let's see if we can meet there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $90 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. 
*  I still have 5 rounds left, so I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $88.50. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm still trying to keep the price below $90.
* I've increased my offer from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
*  I've framed the offer as a ""compromise"" to make it seem like a fair solution for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $89.25. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has indicated this is her lowest price, and it's just a little above my desired price range.
* I have only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Alice.
* Buying from John would be more expensive. 

It's better to accept the offer now and secure the product at a price that is close to my maximum value."
