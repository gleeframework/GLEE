Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $12,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. 

This strategy attempts to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still making the offer appealing enough for him to accept."
