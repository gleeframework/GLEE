"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value, even at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,000? That's a fair offer, considering the value it holds for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,500.  This is my final offer, as I know I can find other buyers at this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
