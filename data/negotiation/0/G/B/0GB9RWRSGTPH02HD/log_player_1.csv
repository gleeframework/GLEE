"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  $20,000 gives me a good buffer to work with if Bob counteroffers.
* **Strategic Choice:**  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer.  If he rejects, it gives me valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  Bob's offer is my minimum, and while it's not a loss, it doesn't leave me with any profit.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to try and see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Value of Information:**  By rejecting his offer, I can learn more about his willingness to pay and potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's commitment to the deal and his potential to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Prices:** Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a profitable deal with Bob increases. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my expectations."
