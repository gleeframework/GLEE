Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and leaves room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation. Good luck with your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I want to sell the product, I am not willing to compromise that much. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 

This counteroffer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your own value.
* **It's closer to your minimum:**  By moving closer to your $15,000 minimum, you leave less room for further negotiation while still showing flexibility.
* **It's phrased positively:** This maintains a friendly tone and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of you.

It's important to remember that this is still a negotiation, and Bob could still reject your counteroffer. But by taking this approach, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still protecting your own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $12,500. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference at $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer continues the negotiation while still pushing towards my goal of earning closer to my minimum value. Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Compromise but not at a loss:**  The offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm not giving in entirely.
* **Focus on fair value:** I reiterate my belief that $12,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, reinforcing my position.
* **Keeps the door open:** By phrasing the message as a question, I encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially reach an agreement."
