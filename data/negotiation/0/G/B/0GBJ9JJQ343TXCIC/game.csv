"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference at $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",12000.0,Alice,5,
