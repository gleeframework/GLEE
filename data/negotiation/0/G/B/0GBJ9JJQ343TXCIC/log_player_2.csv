"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Although Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to potentially secure a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to my budget while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal. It's not a significant difference from John's offer, but it's worth seeing if she'll come down another $500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference at $12,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has met John's price. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better deal, and it's not worth the risk of Alice retracting her offer. It's time to buy from John."
