Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn even more.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The knowledge of John's offer ($1,000,000) provides a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed a significant profit."
