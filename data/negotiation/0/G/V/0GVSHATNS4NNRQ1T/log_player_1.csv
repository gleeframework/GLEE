Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We are getting closer to a deal, but I still think I can get a slightly higher price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,375,000 at this point."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the negotiations have stalled at a price that's too low for me. With only four rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to secure a better price from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It's time to move on."
