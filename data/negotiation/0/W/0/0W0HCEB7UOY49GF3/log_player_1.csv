{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $8,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but I'm happy to accept it and avoid further negotiation.  I can always try to get a better price with another buyer in the future."
