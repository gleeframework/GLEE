Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $80, and we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher initially leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential Profit:**  A price of $170, if accepted, yields a higher profit than selling directly to John. 
* **Justification:** The message includes a phrase about a ""special price"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the price slightly above his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  If Bob rejects it, we can always come down to a price closer to $150, ensuring we still make a profit."
