Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and will be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now higher than John's offer and  closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
