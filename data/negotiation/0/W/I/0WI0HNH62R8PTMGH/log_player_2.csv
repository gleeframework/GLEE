It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good price, and it's a significant improvement from her original offer of $950,000. It's worth accepting this offer before potentially getting stuck in a longer negotiation or paying the full $1,000,000 to John."
