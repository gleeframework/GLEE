Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible. I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is close to my minimum, I think I can push for a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to stay above my minimum value.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I would prefer to get more money, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with even less. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value."
