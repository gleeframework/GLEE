"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering the value you place on it yourself. Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given the value you placed on the product and my budget, I believe $1,050,000 represents a fair compromise. It's a significant step closer to your price, and it allows me to stay within my financial limits. I'm confident this is a win-win solution for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
