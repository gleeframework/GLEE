Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 is a strategic move. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below your guaranteed price ($100). 
* **Potential for Success:**  There's a chance Bob might find the offer appealing enough to accept, netting you a higher profit. 

**Important Note:** While you could try for a higher price with Bob, there's a risk he'll reject it outright. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
