Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I offer Bob the product for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'm not too thrilled about his offer of $85. I was hoping to get a bit more for it.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to the $120 that Bob is willing to pay. Let's say I offer the product to Bob for $100.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've made a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's making another offer. His offer of $82 is still lower than the $100 I was hoping for, but it's getting closer.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better deal. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll make another counteroffer. Let's say I offer the product to Bob for $95.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my counteroffer again, and now he's making another offer. His offer of $85 is still not as high as I was hoping for, and I'm starting to think that I might not be able to get a better deal from him.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer again and consider selling the product to John for $80. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob if I can get a guaranteed sale for $80.
