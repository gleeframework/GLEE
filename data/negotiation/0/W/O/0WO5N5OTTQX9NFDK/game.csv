"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
