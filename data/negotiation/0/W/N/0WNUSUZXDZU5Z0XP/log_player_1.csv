Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82.5 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is closer to my ideal price than John's offer.  It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's offer."
