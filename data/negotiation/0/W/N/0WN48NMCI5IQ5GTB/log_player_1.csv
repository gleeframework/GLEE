"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he has room to negotiate.  I'll see if he's willing to bite, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for $10,000 if I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $11,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm determined to get at least $10,000. Selling to John would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my target. $10,500 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he rejects again, I might start considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm determined to get at least $10,000. I'll counteroffer one more time. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm offering the product for $10,000, which is my minimum.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  Even though I have one more round, I'm too close to my minimum price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John."
