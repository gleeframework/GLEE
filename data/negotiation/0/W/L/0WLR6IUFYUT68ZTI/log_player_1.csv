Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:** While you have John as a backup, closing the deal with Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures you get the highest possible price."
