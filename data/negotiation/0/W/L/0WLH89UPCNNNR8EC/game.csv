,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $95, and I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
