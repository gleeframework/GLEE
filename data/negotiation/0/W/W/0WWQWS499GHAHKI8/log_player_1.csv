"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, though. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is still below my minimum value of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
