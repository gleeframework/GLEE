"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very competitive price of $1,400,000. I know you value it at $1,200,000, so this is a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a price that's mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
