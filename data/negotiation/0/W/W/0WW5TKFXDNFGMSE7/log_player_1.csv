Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  My starting price is $18,000.  I'm confident it's a great value for you, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than that.  I'll counteroffer and see where we can land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $12,000 is a bit too far off for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we settle closer to the middle ground at $14,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not comfortable with $14,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay above my minimum of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting closer. Let's try $15,500.  I'm feeling flexible at this point, but I can't go lower than my minimum."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate your flexibility.  To be honest with you, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $15,000. To avoid that hassle, I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $14,500.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll make one more counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit low for me. This is my final offer, I'm willing to go down to $15,000. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 15000}
