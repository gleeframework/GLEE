"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by our previous customers. Given its quality and uniqueness, we believe it's worth more than $100. Considering this, I'm extending an exclusive offer to you for $120. This is a special opportunity to acquire the product at a value slightly above its worth to you, while allowing us to fairly compensate for our efforts and resources. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is still more than your maximum budget. You can get the product for $100 from John, which is a better deal."
