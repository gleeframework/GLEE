"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $750,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $725,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $675,000. Would that be feasible for you?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $675,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,5,
