Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our minimum is $150.
* **Appeal to Value:**  While $120 is Bob's value, phrasing the offer as a ""special price"" might make it more appealing. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting us closer to our desired price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. We could start higher and risk Bob rejecting the offer outright. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
