"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $140 is closer, I'm still on a bit of a budget. Would you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
