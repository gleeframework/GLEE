"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is close to your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further. Even a small reduction would save you money compared to buying from John."
