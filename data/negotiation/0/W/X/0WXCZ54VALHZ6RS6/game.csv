"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, while also being within my financial limits. Let's try to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
