"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate, but also shows I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message establishes a positive tone and encourages a response. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives Bob the incentive to negotiate, potentially leading to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Room for improvement:**  I can likely get a better price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $80 if I don't reach a deal with Bob. This gives me the flexibility to be more assertive in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by much.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't undervalue the product.
* **Positive message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive.
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still comfortably above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not ideal:**  While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can potentially get a bit more with continued negotiation.
* **The pressure is on:** Bob is clearly getting closer to my minimum, so I need to decide whether to hold out for a better price or settle.
* **John is still an option:**  Selling to John for $80 is a fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob. This gives me the confidence to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm actively trying to reach a deal. It also helps me to avoid going back and forth with small price adjustments.
* **Fair price:** $107.50 is a decent compromise, still above my minimum, and likely within Bob's acceptable range.
* **Positive message:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation positive."
