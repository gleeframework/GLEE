"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I've done some research and I think the product is worth that to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11000. This still leaves me with some room to negotiate, but it's a significant step closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9250. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $9750?  This is a very fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm getting close to being comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm feeling a bit discouraged. I'm willing to go down to $9600 as a final offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal now.",9600.0,Alice,9,
