Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you and I believe it could significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this works for you!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. I am willing to consider your offer of $12,500. However, I would like to propose an alternative: let's aim for a middle ground at $13,500. This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He wants to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating.  There are still rounds left, and Bob has shown he's willing to compromise, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a little above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he is also showing that he is serious about making a deal. He is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget. This shows that he is willing to compromise, but he is also sticking to his principles."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
