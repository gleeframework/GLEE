"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm countering with $10,500.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will find appealing while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through several rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for the same price if this deal falls through."
