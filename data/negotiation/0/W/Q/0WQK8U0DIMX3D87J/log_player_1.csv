Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, given your valuation of $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
