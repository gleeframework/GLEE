"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. We believe it could be a game-changer for you, offering significant value that exceeds its price. Considering its worth to us and the benefits it provides, I'm extending an exclusive offer to acquire this product for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, given your valuation of $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
