"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, given your valuation of $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
