"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price somewhere in between.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to think about the long-term value of the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,075,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
