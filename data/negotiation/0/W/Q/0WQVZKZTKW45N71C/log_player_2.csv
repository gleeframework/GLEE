"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the counteroffer process and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price somewhere in between."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get the price down closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to think about the long-term value of the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,075,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejections and the time constraint of 10 rounds makes accepting her offer the most logical choice. I can save $425,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
