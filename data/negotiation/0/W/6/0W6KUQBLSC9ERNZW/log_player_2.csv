Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still high enough to show that I'm interested in the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To move this forward, I can offer it at $1,500,000.  This reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a profitable deal on your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's in the middle of my target price and Alice's last offer.

{""message"": ""I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
