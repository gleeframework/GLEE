Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging tone helps establish a good rapport.  

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of maximizing profit.
* **Be flexible:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll always have John as a backup buyer to ensure I don't settle for less than my minimum. 
* **Keep John in mind:**  The threat of selling to John provides leverage and keeps Bob motivated to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get.  
* **Moving to the next round:**  This allows me to push for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my target.
* **John as a safety net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to meet him halfway."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a good price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I've lowered my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by calling it ""a product of this caliber."" This subtly reinforces the value proposition.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  A friendly and collaborative approach helps keep the negotiation productive. 

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual concessions:** I'm making smaller concessions to show flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm not willing to drop too low, knowing I have John as a backup buyer.
* **Building rapport:**  I'm trying to establish a positive relationship with Bob to encourage a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need to make some room for other expenses. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,320,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,320,000 is close to my minimum and represents a decent profit margin.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out completely. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and John.
* **Time value of money:**  Delaying the sale could cost me valuable time and opportunity cost. 

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,320,000 is close to my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000, so this offer is within my acceptable range.
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this deal might not be ideal, building a relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a reasonable profit while minimizing risk and potentially opening doors for future business."
