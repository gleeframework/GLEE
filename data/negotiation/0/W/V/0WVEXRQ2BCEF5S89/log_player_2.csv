"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Reasonable offer:** While $7,500 is still a decent amount of money, it's closer to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential compromises as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $8,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still exceeding his limit of $8,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, which means there's likely more room to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Potential to save more:**  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to keep trying to get a better deal and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is my best offer, so let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer slightly. 
* **Closer to his budget:** $8,250 is only $250 over Bob's limit, making this a reasonable compromise.
* **Firm stance:**  By stating it's his ""best offer"", Bob is conveying that he's serious about this price."
