Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
