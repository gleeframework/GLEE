"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't quite go down to $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we split the difference at $13,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
