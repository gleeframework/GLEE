Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price and the value I have for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a price closer to my value, but I'm also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that I can get my full value from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to pay enough."
