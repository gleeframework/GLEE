Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a million, the increments are small, and we're still in early rounds.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Taking the guaranteed offer avoids further risk of Bob stalling or the negotiations failing."
