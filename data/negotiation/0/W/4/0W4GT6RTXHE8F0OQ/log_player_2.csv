You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room to bargain with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13500. That's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.

While $13,500 is closer to your maximum, it's still above what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice has already shown flexibility."
