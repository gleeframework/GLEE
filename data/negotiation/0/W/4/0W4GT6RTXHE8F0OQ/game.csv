,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $13000. Let me know if you're open to that price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13500. That's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really aiming to stay below $13000. How about we meet in the middle at $13250?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",13250.0,Bob,4,
