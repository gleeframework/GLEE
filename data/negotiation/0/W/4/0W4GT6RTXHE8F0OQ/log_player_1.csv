Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to capture as much of the potential surplus as possible.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, suggesting I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup option provides me with a safety net and gives me more negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $14000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $13000. Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum.
* **Counter-offering allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that is closer to my desired outcome. 
* **I have leverage.**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  I can leverage this to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the perceived fairness of the offer.
* **Continuing the Conversation:** I'm keeping the dialogue open and encouraging further negotiation by using a question (""How about we split the difference?"")"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really aiming to stay below $13000. How about we meet in the middle at $13250?  I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  This is a good deal for me, considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, he could walk away. It's better to secure a price that's close to my minimum than risk getting nothing.
* **Time Factor:**  While I have John as a backup, it's unclear how long it would take to finalize a deal with him. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly."
