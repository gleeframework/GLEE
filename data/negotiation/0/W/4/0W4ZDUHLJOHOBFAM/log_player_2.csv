# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I believe its potential for you warrants a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,350,000?
