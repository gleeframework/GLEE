"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum, hoping to entice Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's a good start. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $135? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable and showing flexibility to Bob. I'm also reiterating my willingness to compromise to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $130. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have 6 rounds left before I need to consider selling to John, and I believe I can reach a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $132.50. It's a fair compromise for both of us and we can move on from there."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable and showing flexibility to Bob.  I'm also highlighting that this is a compromise to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his perceived value of the product. It's unlikely he'll budge further, and we've only got 4 rounds left. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and avoid further negotiations."
