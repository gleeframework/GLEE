Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" while still highlighting that it's close to my desired price. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum value as possible. By starting with a slightly lower offer, I leave room for negotiation and show willingness to compromise. This increases the chance of Bob accepting my offer, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a large loss for me. It's crucial to hold firm on my minimum value and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum value. I want to explore if there's some middle ground we can find."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is below what I need to accept, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,000,000?  This still provides you with a great value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my original offer. This demonstrates flexibility while remaining within my minimum value range.
* **Message:** I'm focusing on maintaining a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while highlighting the value the product provides at the proposed price. This approach aims to build rapport and encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with $1,000,000, I'm trying to reach a midpoint that benefits both parties. This move positions me for a potential win-win situation while protecting my minimum acceptable price."
