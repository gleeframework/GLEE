"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully entices Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm still confident I can get more than $12,000, so selling to John right now is not the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to keep negotiating or sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept less than $12,000 at this point, and I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as there's still a chance Bob will come up on his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower and the risk of a further decrease is high. At this point, I am not convinced that Bob will come up to a reasonable price. I'm willing to cut my losses and accept John's offer of $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's important to note that I had a chance to negotiate a higher price than John's offer, but I was ultimately unsuccessful."
