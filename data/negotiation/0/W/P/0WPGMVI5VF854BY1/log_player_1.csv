Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I've set the initial price at $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and enthusiastic. This helps to build rapport with Bob and makes him feel valued.
* **Flexibility:** I've indicated openness to negotiation. This shows that I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is just too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with reason:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but explain why it's not acceptable. This keeps the negotiation respectful.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I've proposed $14,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Highlighting benefits:** I re-emphasize that this is still a good deal for both of us. This helps to motivate Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has offered my minimum value of $12,000.  At this point, it's in my best interest to accept his offer.  It's a fair price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or the need to sell to John for the same amount."
