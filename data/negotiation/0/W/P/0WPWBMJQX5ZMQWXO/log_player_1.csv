Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price.  I'm also aware that I have John as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price than John's offer, but still lower than what I'd prefer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still holding firm on a price that's higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer and closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer to get even more, I'm wary of pushing further and risking losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a decent price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
