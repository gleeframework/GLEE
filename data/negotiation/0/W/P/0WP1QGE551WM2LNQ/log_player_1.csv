Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It also opens the door to a friendly conversation, which might help secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  That's a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and hopefully secure a deal that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This is a great price for both of us and I'm sure you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $107.50. It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've already made a few concessions, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  $107.50 is a decent profit, and it seems like Bob is serious about getting the product. It's better than the $100 from John. I'll accept his offer and end the negotiation."
