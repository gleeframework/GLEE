Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my target price of $800,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's possible that Alice will become less willing to compromise as we get closer to my price.  Also, we're already five rounds in, and I don't want to risk losing the product to another buyer.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product and save a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
