# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, the negotiation has reached a point where it is highly likely that Bob will not offer a higher price.  It's best to accept his offer and secure the deal.  While $13,300 is lower than the ideal $15,000, it is still a better deal than risking the remaining rounds and potentially ending up with nothing."
