"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,000?  That's a good compromise and still allows me to make a decent profit.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we both need to make a fair deal here.  Could we agree on $9,000? That's a reasonable compromise closer to the middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
