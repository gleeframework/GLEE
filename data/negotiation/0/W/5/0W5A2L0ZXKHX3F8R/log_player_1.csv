"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $140, especially since the product is worth $150 to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 157.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $157.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $152.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  $152.50 is more than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price.  It's also a good compromise with Bob, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still making a profit."
