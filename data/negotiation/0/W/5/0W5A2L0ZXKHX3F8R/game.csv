"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $157.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $152.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",152.5,Bob,4,
