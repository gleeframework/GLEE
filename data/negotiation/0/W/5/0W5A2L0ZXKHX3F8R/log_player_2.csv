Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and her offer is too high."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $140?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but we're getting closer.  It's worth seeing if we can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $157.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $152.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 152.5}
