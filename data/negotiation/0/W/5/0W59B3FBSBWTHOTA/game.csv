"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good value for you considering the benefits of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $140.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $145? That's a significant drop from my previous offer and puts us closer to your price.  I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
