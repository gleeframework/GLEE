Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a decent markup from my minimum acceptable price of $120, and allows for some room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but not so high that it scares Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of getting more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price, and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me, and I don't think I'll be able to get a higher price from him.  John is offering me a guaranteed $120, which is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
