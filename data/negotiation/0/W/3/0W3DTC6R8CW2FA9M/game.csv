"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product. I can do a bit better than my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least a small profit. I can do $115, and that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still out of my range. I'm happy to pay $105, and that's my final offer.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $115, which is $110. That's my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",110.0,Alice,7,
