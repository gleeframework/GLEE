Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $115 is also below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to negotiate and potentially agree to a price that benefits both of us.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and optimistic in my message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since he's already shown interest in the product. 
* **Counter-offering:** I'll reject his offer and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110?  That's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I'm getting a reasonable profit.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $95. This allows us both to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **No further room for negotiation:** I've already lowered my price twice.  Bob's counter-offer suggests he's not willing to budge significantly. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price:**  John is willing to buy the product for $100, which is my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money. 

It's better to sell to John and guarantee a $100 profit than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might result in a lower price or a prolonged negotiation that could potentially lead to a dead-end."
