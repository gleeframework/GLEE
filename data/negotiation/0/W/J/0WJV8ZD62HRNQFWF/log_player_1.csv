Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Your decision to purchase now ensures you capitalize on this unique opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By starting high, you emphasize the perceived value of the product. You are aiming to position it as something truly exceptional.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob balks at the initial price, the message leaves room for negotiation. This keeps the door open for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your fallback of $1,000,000."
