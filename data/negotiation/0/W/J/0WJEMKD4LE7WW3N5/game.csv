"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12,500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
