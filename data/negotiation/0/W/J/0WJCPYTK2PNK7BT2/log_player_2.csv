"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial counteroffer is $1,250,000. This is a significant step down from Alice's offer, showing Bob is serious about saving money.
* **Strategic Approach:** Bob's message is polite but firm, highlighting the value to him while emphasizing his budget constraint. It creates a sense of compromise without being overly aggressive. 
* **Next Steps:** By offering a counteroffer, Bob gains more information about Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and still leaves some room for you to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has room to make a counteroffer. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While buying from John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, there's still a chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice.  

**Next Steps:**  Bob should make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a smaller step down from Alice's previous offer, indicating he's serious about getting a deal but is also getting closer to his limit. 
* **Compromise:**  By offering a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's, Bob demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Justification:**  He again emphasizes the value he sees in the product, reinforcing that he's not simply trying to get a low price but is willing to pay fairly.

**Next Steps:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice. If she rejects it, Bob might be forced to go with John. If she accepts, Bob achieves a good price while still saving some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1290000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $1285000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Close to the Limit:**  Alice is clearly getting closer to Bob's price point, indicating she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Balancing Risk:** Bob is nearing his limit and buying from John for $1,200,000 is a very viable option. However, there's still potential for Bob to get a slightly better price with Alice.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should make another counteroffer, trying to get even closer to his budget but being aware of the risk of losing the deal if he's too aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to a deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,285,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in it while still allowing us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob's message clearly communicates this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Aggressive but Justified:**  This counteroffer is a significant jump from his last offer but still within a reasonable range, given Alice's previous offers.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Bob reiterates the value he sees in the product, justifying the price, making his offer seem less unreasonable.
* **Risk Calculation:** Bob is now taking a risk. If Alice rejects, he might have to go with John, but he is betting on her wanting to close the deal. 

**Next Steps:** This is a high-stakes move. If Alice accepts, Bob gets a good deal. If she rejects, he might have to take the safer option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1290000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Room:** Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is still $80,000 above Bob's budget.  
* **High Risk:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high. Bob has made several offers, and Alice has consistently countered with prices above his limit.
* **Safe Option:**  Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget. This is the safest and most reliable option at this point.

**Conclusion:**  While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay more with John is not worth it. It's time to secure the product and move on."
