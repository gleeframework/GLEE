"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum price. Let's try to find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This would be a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come without losing money.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
