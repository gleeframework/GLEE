Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for a loss."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not ready to settle for a loss yet. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
