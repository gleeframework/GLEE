Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum price. Let's try to find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This would be a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come without losing money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

At this point, Alice has come down to John's price.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely she'll go any lower.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John."
