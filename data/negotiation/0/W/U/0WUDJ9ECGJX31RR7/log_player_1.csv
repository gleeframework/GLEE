Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I am willing to sell to John for $10,000, I'm not willing to give up the potential for a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm concerned about the potential for further negotiation. It's better to secure the sale with John at $10,000 and avoid the risk of a lower price in the future."
