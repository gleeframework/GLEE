Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is slightly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives Bob a potential gain of $4,000 while ensuring you a sale close to your desired price. If Bob rejects, you can safely sell to John for $15,000."
