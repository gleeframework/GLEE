"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $92.50",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet at $87.50. It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford and still allows you to make a decent profit.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $92.00. It's a fair price that's close to our previous discussions and still below your original offer of $100.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $92 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference one more time at $89.50? This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal.",89.5,Bob,6,
