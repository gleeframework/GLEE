"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,200. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",13200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,200 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a very competitive price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,600. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to save a bit more.",13600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. $13,600 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,800. That's my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",13800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
