Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and easy to understand.

By offering a price slightly lower than the middle ground, you encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential negotiation that could result in a price closer to your desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than your minimum of $80, you can likely still get more from Bob.  He clearly values the product at $150, and your initial offer of $120 showed that you're willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a better price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly can increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from your initial offer, you demonstrate that you're open to negotiation.
* **Highlight the value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him can make the price seem more reasonable. 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to your desired price.  It also positions you to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we split the difference and do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is getting very close to your minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's higher than the guaranteed sale price with John. This is a good opportunity to secure a sale without risking further negotiation that might result in a lower price. Accepting the offer allows you to close the deal and move on."
