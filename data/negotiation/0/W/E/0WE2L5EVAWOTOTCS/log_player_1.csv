Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find valuable.  Given its unique features, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000 before considering other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's limit is impossible:** We only know Bob *values* the product at $1,000,000, not necessarily his maximum buying price.  
* **Aiming high, but reasonable:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above John's offer. 
* **Creating urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will get $1,200,000 from John. However, there's also potential for a higher profit if Bob accepts."
