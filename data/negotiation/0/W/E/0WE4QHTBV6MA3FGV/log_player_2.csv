**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price. 
* **You are saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. 
* **Even with a higher value:** Although you value the product at $1,500,000, Alice's offer still allows you to make a substantial profit (your value - her price = $1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000)."
