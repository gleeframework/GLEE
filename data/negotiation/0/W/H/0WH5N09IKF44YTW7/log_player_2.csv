"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you time to try and lower the price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to try and save money, so buying from John at $15,000 should be your last option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:**  You want to start by making a significant counteroffer to signal your intent to negotiate and potentially catch Alice off guard.
* **Not too low:** $9,500 is still within your budget and potentially leaves some room for Alice to counter.
* **Testing the waters:** You want to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how much she's willing to compromise."

* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** We want to see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway or if she's sticking to a higher price point.
* **Still within budget:**  $10,500 is still comfortably within our budget, allowing for more negotiation room.

By offering a slightly higher price, we're aiming to find a middle ground and hopefully reach an agreement with Alice in the coming rounds."

By making a substantial increase in our offer, we're hoping to create a sense of urgency and incentivize Alice to accept before time runs out. If she rejects, we can still make a final counteroffer in the next round, but we're aiming for a successful negotiation in this round."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  We're making a final, significant increase in our offer. We're approaching Alice's price point and demonstrating our seriousness about closing the deal.
* **Time pressure:** With only one round left, we're putting pressure on Alice to accept our offer or risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Taking a calculated risk:**  $12,000 is close to our budget limit, but we're willing to take a slight risk to secure the product for a price better than John's offer.

This counteroffer is our last chance to reach a deal with Alice. It's a bold move, but we believe it has the highest chance of securing the product for a price we're comfortable with."
