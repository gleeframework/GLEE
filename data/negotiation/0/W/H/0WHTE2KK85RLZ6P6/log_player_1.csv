"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** A $100,000 gap between my offer and Bob's value gives us some room to negotiate over the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, I'm willing to continue negotiating. There's still a significant gap between his offer and my minimum, which leaves room for compromise. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'd prefer to try and get a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the discount:** I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to make it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Setting a firm stance:** I state that this is the ""best I can do"" to signal that further negotiation may be difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob before settling for the guaranteed price from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my absolute final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,140,000.  This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1140000}

* **Small compromise:** I'm only increasing my offer by $15,000, signaling a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.

* **Urgency:** I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by stating, ""Let's get this deal done!"" to encourage Bob to accept."
