Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're interested in this type of product, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 offer:** This is a good compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's estimated value ($8,000). It's high enough for me to make a profit, but low enough to potentially entice Bob to buy. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and focuses on the potential benefits of owning it. 
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and me selling to John for my minimum value."
