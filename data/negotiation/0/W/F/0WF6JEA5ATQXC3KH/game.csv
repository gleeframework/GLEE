"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $150? That's my absolute maximum.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $150 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $160? That's a fair price for both of us and I can make the purchase right away.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $165? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
