"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget and he can get the product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob should offer Alice the maximum price he's willing to pay, which is $8,000. This leaves no room for negotiation and lets Alice know he's serious about buying the product at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and only $1,000 more than what he could get from John.  There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product entirely."
