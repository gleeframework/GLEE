"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further and offer the product to you for $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and gives us a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
