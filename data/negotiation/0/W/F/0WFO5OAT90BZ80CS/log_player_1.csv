{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" deal, aiming to build rapport with Bob.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to create a constructive negotiation atmosphere.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value ($1,500,000).
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price through further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:** 

I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while considering Bob's constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to show my commitment to reaching an agreement. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm narrowing the gap between our offers, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiations and avoids unnecessary conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I would like to counter with a price of $1,125,000. This price reflects a compromise that allows for a reasonable investment while also providing some benefit to you. I hope we can move forward with this arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer, while closer to my desired price, is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and avoid making concessions that would significantly impact my potential earnings.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price by strategically negotiating.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the most beneficial option.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while keeping in mind Bob's willingness to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $1,125,000 is closer, it's still a bit short of what the product is truly worth. Let's aim for a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round to show flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's worth to ensure Bob understands its value.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage further negotiations.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With limited rounds remaining, I'm strategically making small concessions to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

**Next Steps:**

I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds and will assess whether to make further concessions or sell to John based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I would like to counter with a price of $1,135,000. This price reflects a compromise that allows for a reasonable investment while also providing some benefit to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,135,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer is very close to my previous offer of $1,140,000.  The difference is only $5,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  There's a good chance that Bob will accept a small counteroffer from me, but there's also a risk that we might reach a stalemate.
* **Better Than John:** While $1,135,000 is significantly lower than my desired value, it's still better than selling to John for $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps:** 

Since I'm accepting Bob's offer, the negotiation process is complete. I will finalize the sale with Bob."
