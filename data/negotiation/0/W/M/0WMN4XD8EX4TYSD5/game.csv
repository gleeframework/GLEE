"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value your time and effort, but $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $108, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal now.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's my final offer. If you can do that, I'll make the deal",105.0,Bob,6,
