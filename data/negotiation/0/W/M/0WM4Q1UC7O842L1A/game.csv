,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I agree that it has great potential for my business. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a significant investment for you, and it has the potential to generate a substantial return. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
