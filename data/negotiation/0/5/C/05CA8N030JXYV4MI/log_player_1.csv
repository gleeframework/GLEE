"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $750,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a reasonable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $800,000. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and close the deal."
