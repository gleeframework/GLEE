"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm still a little ways off at that price. Would you be open to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $7,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price that still gives you a great value for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",9000.0,Alice,5,
