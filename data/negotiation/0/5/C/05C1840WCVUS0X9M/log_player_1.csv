Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to capture the most value from Bob's higher perceived worth.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  Starting significantly lower than Bob's $1,500,000 valuation allows for potential negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential discount while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Confident Tone:**  Framing the offer positively and highlighting Bob's expertise encourages a positive response.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Inviting Bob's thoughts keeps the communication open for a potential counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If negotiations fall through and you're unable to reach a mutually agreeable price, you always have the backup offer from John."
