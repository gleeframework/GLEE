Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good deal since he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is close to my ideal price point, and it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer is the best option for maximizing my profit at this point."
