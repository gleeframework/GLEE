"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer of $180 is too high. It makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $150 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your $120 limit. You can likely still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $120. How about we settle on $130? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130}
