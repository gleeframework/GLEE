"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $15000 to me. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000, which is the most I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my original asking price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",14000.0,Alice,5,
