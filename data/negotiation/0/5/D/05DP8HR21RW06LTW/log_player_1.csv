""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Our goal is to get as close to that as possible while ensuring Bob still sees a benefit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **High Anchor:**  This initial price sets a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to our desired outcome than if we started lower.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum."
