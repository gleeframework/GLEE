"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $170 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet at $100? That way we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying my best to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to settle at $95?  That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,6,
