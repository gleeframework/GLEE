"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay, there's no reason to immediately accept.  You have 10 rounds and can potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (half of Alice's initial price) is a strong negotiating tactic. It signals your willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for compromise. This initial low offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your ideal range.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to explore that potential. You can aim for a price closer to your initial counteroffer or try a slightly higher number to see if you can strike a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing your willingness to meet Alice halfway, but it's still lower than Alice's current offer.  This approach increases the likelihood of a deal while keeping your goal of saving money in mind."
