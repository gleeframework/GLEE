"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum of $1,000,000, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value you've outlined, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing my intention to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I frame it as a ""fair price that benefits both of us"" to emphasize a win-win scenario.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Leaving room to negotiate further (since Alice values the product at $800,000), while still securing a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $880,000 is a good price for me.  It's still well below my maximum price of $1,000,000 and leaves me with a decent savings.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation."
