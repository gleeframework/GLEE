"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $750,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $850,000. This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
