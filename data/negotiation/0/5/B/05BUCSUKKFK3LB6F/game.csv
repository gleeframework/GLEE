"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my valuable product.  It's a unique asset worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it could be highly beneficial for you as well.  I'm starting the conversation with a price of $2000000.  This reflects its true value and allows for potential negotiation.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I am willing to pay up to $1500000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 doesn't quite meet my minimum value for the product.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $1750000, reflecting a significant concession. I believe this price is still fair given the product's unique value and potential for benefit.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
