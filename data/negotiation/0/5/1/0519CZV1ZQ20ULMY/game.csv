"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's unique value, and I believe it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue to explore a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $787,500 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with given the product's value.  Let's make this deal work. ",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
