Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob above our minimum ($15,000) is ideal for maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's a strong opening price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still potentially attractive compared to not acquiring the product at all. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages dialogue by inviting Bob's thoughts, potentially giving us insights into his negotiation strategy and willingness to pay. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
