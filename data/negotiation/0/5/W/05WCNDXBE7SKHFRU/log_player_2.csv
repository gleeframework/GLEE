"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a great deal for both of us, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can do better than $950,000.  You'll counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $900,000. I'm offering it to you for $920,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You are still able to get a better price.  $920,000 is still above your target of $800,000. You'll counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  I think this price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $910,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. You've negotiated the price down to $910,000, which is within your budget and a good compromise. Going back and forth with counteroffers might not get you a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Buying from John would cost you $1,000,000.  It's best to accept Alice's offer and save $90,000."
