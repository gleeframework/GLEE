Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob truly is. If he outright rejects it, I know he's aiming for a price significantly lower.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. I don't need to desperately settle for a low price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my safety net price with John, there's still potential for negotiation. Bob offering $15,000 suggests he values the product and might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 17500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $17,500, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point, hoping to sway Bob towards a higher number.
* **Maintaining Margin:** This price point still gives me a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I am still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has offered $15,000 twice now, signaling a strong resistance to going any higher. Further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Matching Safety Net:** Accepting Bob's offer yields the same profit as selling to John. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation might not be worth the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob. Closing the deal now provides immediate value."
