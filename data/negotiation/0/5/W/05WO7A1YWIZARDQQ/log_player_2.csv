"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high and he has a better alternative with John.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer doesn't get him anywhere close to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. While I understand your position, $850,000 is significantly below what I believe to be a fair price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings while still providing you with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still too high. He's still better off going with John at this point.  He has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still allowing you a comfortable profit. Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
