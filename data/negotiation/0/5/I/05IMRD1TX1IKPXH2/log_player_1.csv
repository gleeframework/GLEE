"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging that Bob values the product and trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that this is a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my target price. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how many rounds are left. If the negotiation doesn't look promising, I'll switch to John to ensure I get at least $100 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal value. With 8 rounds left, I have enough time to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.  

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $100, aiming to secure a deal that's more favorable to me. If Bob continues to resist, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price by $5, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still above my minimum threshold of $100.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting it's a good deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground where we both feel good about the deal.  I'm trying to push Bob closer to my target price while also showing that I'm willing to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy and consider whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I am open to negotiation, I cannot sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to counteroffer with a price closer to my target value. However, I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John to ensure I get at least $100. With only 6 rounds left, time is becoming a factor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $85 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to go down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price again to $90, which is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing that my price is still fair.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this could be our last chance to agree.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to make a tough decision.  I'll consider the number of rounds left and the potential for further negotiation. If I don't feel confident about getting a better price, I might sell to John to guarantee a minimum of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a better price from Bob are slim.  

**Strategy:**

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price lower than my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John.  This guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable value for the product."
