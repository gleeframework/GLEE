"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9500. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $9500, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $9000.  Perhaps we can split the difference and settle on $9250? It would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
