Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This price is higher than my guaranteed value from John, giving me a chance to earn more. 
*  I'm taking a risk, but it's a calculated one.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum desired profit. 
* This approach is based on the principle of ""anchoring"" â€“ starting with a higher price to potentially negotiate down to a mutually acceptable amount if Bob is interested."
