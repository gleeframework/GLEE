Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $100. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable price for me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** By starting high, I can understand Bob's potential willingness to pay. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I can adjust the price down if necessary, but I'm starting with a price that is favorable to me.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $80. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could accept and sell for $80, this would result in a loss for me.  

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value while still having the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for you. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've countered with $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still a decent compromise from my initial asking price. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and focused on finding a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm aiming to show flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's profitable for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's low offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Find a middle ground:** My counteroffer is a step toward Bob's price, making it more likely he'll counter again with a higher price. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** I can still sell to John if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $100? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product is worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price and meets my goal of earning at least $100 for the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale, especially considering I can sell to John for the same price if negotiations continue."
