"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $1350000. This aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay based on its value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1400000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $1375000. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring the product, which is in line with my valuation.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1375000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I propose a price of $1425000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
