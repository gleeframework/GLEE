"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $12,000 is fair. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't quite go down to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product. My final offer is $10,200.  Let me know if this works for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which would be $10,000. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
