"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're able to accept that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is refusing to come down to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to get the product from John for $10,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk running out of rounds."
