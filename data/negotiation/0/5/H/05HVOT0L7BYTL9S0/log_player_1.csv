{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't immediately seem outrageous.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob and implies it might be sold elsewhere for even more, creating a sense of urgency.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have space to come down in price and still make more than your $15,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price, ensuring you don't lose out."
