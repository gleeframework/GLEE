"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be open to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13000.0,Alice,5,
