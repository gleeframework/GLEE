Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your minimum ($15,000) but above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, getting you closer to your desired price.
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, a quicker sale to Bob at a slightly lower price might be more desirable if time is a factor.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might outright reject $14,000. However, this offer balances the risk of losing him as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
