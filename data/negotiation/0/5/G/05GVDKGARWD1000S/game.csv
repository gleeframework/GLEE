"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $65 is quite a bit lower than your initial asking price, Alice.  How about we try to split the difference a bit more?  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $75 is still too low. Let's try $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit.",85.0,Alice,5,
