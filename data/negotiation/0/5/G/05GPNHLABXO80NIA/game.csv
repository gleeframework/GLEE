"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about $950,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920,000. I hope we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $940,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know your thoughts.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, as I mentioned before. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider purchasing from another seller.",920000.0,Bob,6,
