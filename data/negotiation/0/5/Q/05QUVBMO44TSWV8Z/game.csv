"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something I know you'll find highly valuable.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the immense value this product holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $925,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our positions. ",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.",937500.0,Alice,5,
