{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount of money. There's room for negotiation, and  I want to see if I can get a better price.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to explore options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 7.1% discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's also within a range that might be reasonable for Alice to consider.  If she rejects this, I can adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired $650,000. I'm not ready to settle yet, especially with multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 660000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $660,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target.  This is a reasonable middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and we're now within a $10,000 range of my initial target.  While I'd still prefer to get the price down further, we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and avoid the risk of Alice becoming less flexible or me having to resort to buying from John at a much higher price."
