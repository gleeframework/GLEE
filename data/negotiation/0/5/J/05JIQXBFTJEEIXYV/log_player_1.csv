{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a middle ground price, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, potentially swaying him towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,500 is my final offer.  If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has shown a strong stance on his price, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.  Selling to John guarantees me a $10,000 profit, which is my minimum acceptable value.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and the risk of a failed deal isn't worth the potential gain."
