"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum price is $150. I'm hoping Bob values the product higher and will be willing to pay more. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, especially since I can sell it to John for $150. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from John's offer to $175. This is still a reasonable compromise, considering I know the product is worth at least $150 to me. I hope this offer is appealing enough for Bob, but I'm still open to negotiating further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price point, but I've already had three rounds of negotiations. While I could continue, there's no guarantee of a better offer from Bob.  John is a sure sale at the same price, so it's more efficient to sell to John now."
