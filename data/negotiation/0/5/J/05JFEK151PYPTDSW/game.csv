"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",980000.0,Alice,5,
