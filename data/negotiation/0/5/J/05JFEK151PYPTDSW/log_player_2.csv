"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she is offering it to you for $1,200,000. This suggests she's willing to negotiate, and you can likely get a better price. You can also go to John and get the product for $800,000, which is your maximum price.  It's a good idea to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get it closer to your budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to your budget, but you can still try to negotiate further. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, so you have room to play with.  Let's see if you can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and buy the product for $800,000.  You've already saved $20,000 compared to Alice's latest offer, and you're guaranteed to get the product."
