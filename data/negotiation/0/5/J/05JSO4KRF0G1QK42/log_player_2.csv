"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($14,000 vs. $12,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price.
* **You have a backup option with John.** This gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer below Alice's initial price:** This shows you're serious about buying but trying to get a better deal.
* **Counteroffer is above Alice's value:**  $13,000 is still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000), giving her a reason to consider.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for a potential back-and-forth, increasing the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your desired price:**  $13,500 is a significant drop from her initial offer and only $500 above your counteroffer.
* **It's a good deal for you:** You're getting the product for $1,500 less than John's price.
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk:** While you could potentially get a lower price, there's a chance Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure a good deal without risking further negotiation."
