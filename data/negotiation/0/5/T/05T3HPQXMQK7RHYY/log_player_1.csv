This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate, while also demonstrating your willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to negotiate further?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."

Bob is firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,350,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
