"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not satisfied with that offer. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to what I'm comfortable with.  While I'd like to push for a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  I'll accept this offer to secure a sale."
