"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. That's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12,750? I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $12,900.  This is the very best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",12900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the direction we're heading, but $12,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,900, which would be $12,450. Can you consider that?",12450.0,Bob,6,
