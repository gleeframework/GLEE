"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value the product brings to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you at $13,000, which is the closest I can get to your offer without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a bit more.  $11,500 is my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
