"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Based on my assessment and budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the item. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a new price of $1200000 is too high for me, I'll go with $1350000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my research and valuation of the product, I believe $1350000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1100000 for the product. This offer reflects a compromise while staying within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and my previous offer of $1350000, so I'm proposing a new price of $1225000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. While I respect your position, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to increase my offer further. Therefore, I am counteroffering at $1150000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1150000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement, but I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and my previous offer of $1225000, so I'm proposing a new price of $1187500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can conclude the sale at this price.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've carefully considered our discussions, and I believe $1187500 is still beyond what I'm able to pay. I am now offering $1100000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a satisfactory conclusion.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
