"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $9500 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $9000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $8750. Let's try to find a middle ground. My next counteroffer is $9200 for the product. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for you, while also considering my minimum price.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $9200 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This feels like a solid compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not ready to meet you at $9000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $9150 for the product. I think this price is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",9150.0,Alice,7,
