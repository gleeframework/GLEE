"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a price that reflects the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the discount you've already offered. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value our negotiation and your understanding of the product's worth.  However, $1,550,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to achieve my target. Let's close this deal now.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
