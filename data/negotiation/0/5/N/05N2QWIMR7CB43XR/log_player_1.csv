"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is above my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that with some negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price point. Selling to John at this stage would be a loss for me, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $11,200? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept his offer yet, as it's still below my initial asking price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John at this stage would be a loss for me, and I'm committed to continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,050?  This is a great price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to my desired price. While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting his offer is the best course of action.  If I reject his offer, we risk not reaching an agreement, and I would be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale and secure a decent profit."
