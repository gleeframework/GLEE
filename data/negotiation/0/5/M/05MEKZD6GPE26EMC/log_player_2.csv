Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $650,000, so I'm offering you the product for $675,000. This is my final counteroffer.
