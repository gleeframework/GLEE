"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $650,000, so I'm offering you the product for $675,000. This is my final counteroffer.",675000.0,Alice,5,
