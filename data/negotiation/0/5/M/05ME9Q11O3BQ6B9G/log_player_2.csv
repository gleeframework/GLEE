"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $1,100,000 is still a bit high, and you have room to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice has come down a bit, but you're still not quite at your desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you've already made progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a tough pill to swallow, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice has come down significantly and is now offering a price that is within your budget. It's a good deal, especially since you're still saving $75,000 compared to buying from John."
