Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  How about we start a bit lower, say $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,900,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you closer to your range. Let's consider $1,500,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference a bit closer to my number, say at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and moving in the right direction. We're getting closer to a price point where I can maximize profit while still making a deal.  It's too early to settle for John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated, and I am too. What if we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is very close to my previous offer and has shown a consistent willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away in further rounds."
