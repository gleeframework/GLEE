"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might make her more willing to negotiate. However, it's still a good amount below my maximum budget, leaving room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $85? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our target price. Let's try to nudge her a little closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it around $75.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We are carefully moving towards our target price while still leaving room for one more round of negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not comfortable going below $80. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $78? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $78, and going any lower might offend her and ruin the deal. Since this is less than our $80 maximum, it's a good deal!"
