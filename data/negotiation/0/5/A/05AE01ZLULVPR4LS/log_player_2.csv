Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $90.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90.  While we could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price again or the potential of running out of rounds. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
