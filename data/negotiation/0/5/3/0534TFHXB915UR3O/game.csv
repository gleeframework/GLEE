"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice. However, $10,800 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to come up to $9,500. That's a fair offer considering my valuation.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,800 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a bit apart. To be honest, I've got another offer for $10,000.  If you can come down to $9,750, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I think I'll have to take the other offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,750, which is $9,975. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",9975.0,Alice,7,
