**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but it's clear you're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price that's significantly higher than his current offer.  It's better to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
