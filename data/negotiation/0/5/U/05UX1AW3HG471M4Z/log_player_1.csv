Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000 from John, but I believe it's a fair price that still allows for potential negotiation. 

This strategy is based on the following logic:

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a higher price than my minimum ensures greater profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The price isn't so high as to be immediately rejected, allowing for potential bargaining if Bob shows interest. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, limiting my potential downside."
