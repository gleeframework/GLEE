Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at $12,000 gives him a potential profit of $2,000, making it likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Value to Alice:**  While $12,000 is less than Alice's minimum, it's still a decent profit, and she avoids the hassle and uncertainty of finding a new buyer.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The $12,000 price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. Depending on the nature of the product and your relationship with Bob, you might adjust the price or the message accordingly."
