"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150.  It's a great deal you won't want to miss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($120) and John's offer ($120). It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
