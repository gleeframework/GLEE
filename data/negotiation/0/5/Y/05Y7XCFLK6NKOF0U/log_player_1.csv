"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price, especially since I have more negotiation rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is a good profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal.  While I could potentially push for a higher price, I'm worried about risking the deal and ending up with less than this."
