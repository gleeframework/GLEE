"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $145 is within your budget, you can save more money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John is willing to sell the product for $150, but Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject her initial offer."
