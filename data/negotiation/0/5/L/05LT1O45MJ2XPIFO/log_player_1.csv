{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a strong opportunity for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it significantly above Bob's valuation but below John's offer leaves room for negotiation while ensuring Alice gets a good deal. 

This initial offer aims to anchor the price high, giving Alice room to negotiate down if needed while still exceeding Bob's valuation."
