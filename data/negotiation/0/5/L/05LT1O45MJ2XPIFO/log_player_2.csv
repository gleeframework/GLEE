# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a strong opportunity for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
