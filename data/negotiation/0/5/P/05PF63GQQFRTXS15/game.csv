"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product's value for me.  Let me know what you think!",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a decent amount for the product.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I believe you'll still get a fantastic deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,800. This is the absolute maximum I can do. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",12800.0,Bob,6,
