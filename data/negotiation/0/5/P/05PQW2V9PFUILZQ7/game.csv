"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Could you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
