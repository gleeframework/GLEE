"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I'm looking to get from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $8,200 for the product. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us?",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very patient and I respect that.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000.  If you can do that, we have a deal.  If not, I understand and wish you the best in selling the product.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $8,000. I'm not sure if I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I need to consider John's offer as well. Can you think of a reason why you're worth more to me than John?",8100.0,Alice,7,
