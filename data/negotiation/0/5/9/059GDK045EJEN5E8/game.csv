"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. $140 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.",130.0,Alice,5,
