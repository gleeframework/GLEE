Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.

Alice is unlikely to go below $130, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John guarantees the product at my target price."
