"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too much for me. How about $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for some wiggle room.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $100 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",112.5,Alice,5,
