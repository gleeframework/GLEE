"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $999000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both parties.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still outside my price range. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800000 is still a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both parties.",875000.0,Alice,5,
