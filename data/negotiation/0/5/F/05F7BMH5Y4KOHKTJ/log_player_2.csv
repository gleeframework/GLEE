"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense potential value, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You want to save as much money as possible, and $1,300,000 is well above your desired price range.
* **Counteroffers are possible.** There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the process of lowering the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.**  While it's a compromise, $1,150,000 is still too high for you.
* **You have more negotiation rounds.**  You've already made a counteroffer and shown your willingness to negotiate. This allows you to continue lowering the price. 
* **There's room for more compromise.** You can likely get a better price than $1,150,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. To show my seriousness in acquiring this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
