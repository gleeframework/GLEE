"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is my best offer, and it's right at the edge of my budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my absolute maximum, but it's a fair compromise given that it's closer to your price. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is closer to my budget and represents a fair middle ground. I really want to make this deal work, and I believe this price is reasonable considering the value we've both discussed.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,375. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,7,
