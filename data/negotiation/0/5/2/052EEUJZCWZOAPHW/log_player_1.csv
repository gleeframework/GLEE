Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product for and what I know he's willing to pay. I'll counter in the next round to bring the price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is too far below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so I propose a price of $1,100,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While closer, Bob's offer is still below my target.  I'll counteroffer again, pushing slightly closer to his offer to signal flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer at $1,025,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or selling to John for less."
