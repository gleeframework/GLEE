Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth while still providing me with a fair profit. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but not unreasonably so allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net ($8,000), allowing Alice to be firmer in negotiations with Bob."
