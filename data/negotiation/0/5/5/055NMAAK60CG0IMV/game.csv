"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $1,025,000.  If we can meet in the middle, we can both get a good deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
