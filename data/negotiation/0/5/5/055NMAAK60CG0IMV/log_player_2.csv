"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down closer to my target of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I still have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get her to go lower.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $1,025,000.  If we can meet in the middle, we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,062,500 is still higher than my target price, and I'm not sure if I can convince her to go lower.  I've already made several counteroffers and there's a chance she won't budge.  To avoid risking further rounds and potentially losing the opportunity, I'll take the safe option and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
