**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet our minimum acceptable price.  He's consistently lowballed, and the negotiations are trending downwards. Holding out for a slightly better offer from Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and take the secure deal."
