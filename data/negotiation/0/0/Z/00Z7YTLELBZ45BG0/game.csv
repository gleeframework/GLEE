"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential and current market conditions, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting the value I see and the price point I can comfortably work with.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too significant a drop from my initial asking price.  I'm confident in the value this product holds, especially considering its long-term potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This offer reflects a significant step towards your asking price while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise given the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making progress, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This shows my continued commitment to this deal and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, but we're running short on time. I've had significant interest from other buyers, including one who's ready to offer $1,200,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to close this deal. I'm willing to accept $965,000 â€“ my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I need a decision soon.",965000.0,Alice,7,
