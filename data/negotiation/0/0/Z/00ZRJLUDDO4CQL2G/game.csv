"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 is already a competitive offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This reflects my best effort to make this deal work for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1,100,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,175,000. Can you consider that?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but  $1,175,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  How about we settle at $1,200,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
