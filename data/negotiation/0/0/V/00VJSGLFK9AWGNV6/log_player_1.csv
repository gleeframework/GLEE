"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me.  This will give me room to negotiate while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and will hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is closer to my minimum,  I'm still not convinced I can't get a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher.  It's risky, but I'm aiming for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still within the range where I'm making a profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer.  I'm aware that I'm taking a risk by not accepting his last offer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I'm also not sure if I can push Bob any further. Given the risk, I'm going to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. While it's not the absolute highest amount I could potentially get, it's a good outcome and minimizes the risk."
