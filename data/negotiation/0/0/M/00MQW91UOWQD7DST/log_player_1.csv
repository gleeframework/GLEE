"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures you receive the full value you place on the product. 
* **Time Savings:** Accepting John's offer avoids further negotiation rounds, saving time and potential frustration.

It's strategically advantageous to take the guaranteed profit now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not result in a better offer."
