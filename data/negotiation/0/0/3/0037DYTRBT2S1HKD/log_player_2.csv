"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would give you a good deal and still allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiation that may lead to a higher price.  He's guaranteed a deal within his budget and saves himself time and potential frustration."
