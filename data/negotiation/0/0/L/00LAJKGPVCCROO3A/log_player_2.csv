"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer is significantly above his maximum price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $120 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating to try and reach a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $100 doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without taking a big loss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should continue negotiating.  While $110 is closer to his budget, he can likely get it for less. There are still rounds remaining to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $110 is still a bit too high. How about we settle on $95? This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
