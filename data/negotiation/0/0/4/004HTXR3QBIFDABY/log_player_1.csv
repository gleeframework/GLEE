Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $170. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Starting high:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to start by aiming higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) to see if I can exceed my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $170 offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauging interest:**  The message is phrased to gauge Bob's interest without revealing desperation.  If he flat out rejects this initial offer, I can always counter-offer closer to his range if I want to avoid the risk of going to John."
