"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob and positions the price as fair, encouraging him to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I make it clear that I'm open to discussion, setting the stage for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,400,000 for it. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not completely meeting it. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Positive message:** I frame my counteroffer as finding common ground, keeping the negotiation amicable.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $1,600,000 is a midpoint between our previous offers, presenting it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,550,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob could reject future offers, potentially forcing me to sell to John at my minimum price.
* **Time constraint:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to potentially get a better deal.

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or running out of time."
