"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and meet at $12,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
