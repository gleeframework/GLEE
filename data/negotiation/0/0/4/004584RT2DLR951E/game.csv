"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $550,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $550,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to $600,000?  That would make it much easier for me to finalize the deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $620,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for both of us.",620000.0,Alice,5,
