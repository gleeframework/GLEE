"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement on the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $900,000 is a significant investment, I believe this product's true value is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects its potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
