{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

By offering a slightly lower price than what Bob is willing to pay, you encourage him to accept your offer.  If he rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer and John's potential offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating with him, potentially reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This price still offers a significant value to you and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not eager to go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That reflects a willingness to compromise on both our parts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Given that John is willing to pay $800,000, it's more advantageous to sell to him and secure a guaranteed profit."
