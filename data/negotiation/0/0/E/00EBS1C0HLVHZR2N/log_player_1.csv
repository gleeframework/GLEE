{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the product's value to Bob while leaving room for him to counter if he wants.  I'll see how Bob responds before deciding whether to engage in further negotiation or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $8,000, but it still leaves a margin for further negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
