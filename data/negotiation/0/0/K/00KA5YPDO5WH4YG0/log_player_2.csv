"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's room for further negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000.  This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal now! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his budget. John offers a price that is within Bob's budget, and it's better to secure the product at a lower cost than to continue negotiating with Alice."
