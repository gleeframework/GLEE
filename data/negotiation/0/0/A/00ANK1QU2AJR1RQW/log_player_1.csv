Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored at $900,000 and moving up incrementally. John offers a clean $1,000,000 with no negotiation hassle. It's better to take the guaranteed profit now."
