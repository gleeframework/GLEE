"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  You have a lot of room to negotiate, and there's no reason to accept it in the first round. You can counteroffer with a lower price and try to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. Although she came down from her original offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and continue to counteroffer in hopes of closing the deal at a lower price."
