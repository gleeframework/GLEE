"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings to your business warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still too high.  I'm confident that this product is worth $980,000 to me. It's a fair price that reflects its value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your business and want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,015,000? This acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,015,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $995,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  This offer is close to your last price and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",995000.0,Bob,6,
