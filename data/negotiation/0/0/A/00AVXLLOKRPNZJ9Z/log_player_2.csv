Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $110.  Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Explanation:  While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $125.  You can get the product for your target price of $120 from John, so it's best to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
