"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A significant counteroffer shows you're serious about negotiating and forces Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Reasonable offer:** $8,000 is still a decent price for a product you value at $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message expresses interest while still setting a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9000? Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $9,000 is a good compromise. 
* **Saving money:** This price is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay to John.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 7 rounds left, accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
