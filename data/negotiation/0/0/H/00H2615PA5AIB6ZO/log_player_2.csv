Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of what you're getting.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to finalize the deal.  We're almost there!  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it's the closest I can come without sacrificing my bottom line.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating and has consistently moved closer to your desired price point.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few thousand dollars more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Alice will hold her ground or you misjudge the situation, leading to you paying more than the current offer or having to settle for John's price.  

Accepting at $1,162,500 secures a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer and is a reasonable compromise."
