# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You know you can buy the same product from John for $150. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer. It's better to wait and see if she offers a lower price, or you can just buy it from John."
