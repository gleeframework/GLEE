"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle again at $15500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to know you're willing to be flexible. I'll give you $13000 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",13000.0,Bob,6,
