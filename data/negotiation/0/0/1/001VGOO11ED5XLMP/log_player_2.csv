"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $90 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and interested:**  Keeps the negotiation friendly and shows we're serious about buying.
* **Anchoring:** Starting significantly lower than $90 ($65)  sets a point of reference, even if we don't get it that low. 
* **Leaves room to negotiate:** Alice is likely to counter, and we can move up from $65 if needed, while staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good!  While $82 is better, it's still a bit too close to our $100 walk-away point. Let's see if we can nudge her down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges progress:** We recognize Alice is negotiating by thanking her for working with us.
* **Splitting the difference (almost):**  Alice went down $8, we're going up $10. Shows a willingness to move. 
* **""Fair compromise"" language:**  Frames the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Still below budget:** $75 leaves us some buffer and room for one more potential round of negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $78? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling that this is her bottom line.  $78 is a good price, saving us $22 from John's offer and $12 from Alice's initial offer.  It's time to accept and get the deal done!"
