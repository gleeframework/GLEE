Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Here's the reasoning:

* **$9,000 is a good starting point:**  It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, showing you believe the product is valuable.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to haggle and hopefully reach a price closer to your ideal.
* **John as a safety net:** You have a guaranteed buyer for $8,000, so you aren't taking a huge risk by asking for more."
