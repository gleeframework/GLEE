"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $80 from John, so it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $100."
