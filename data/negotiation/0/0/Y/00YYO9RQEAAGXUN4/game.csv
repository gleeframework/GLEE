"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and a fair price for the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1025000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
