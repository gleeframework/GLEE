Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave Bob with a perceived gain. Offering a price slightly below his perceived value increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 secures a significant profit for you while still being attractive to Bob, who saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a win-win.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, be prepared to counter-offer or adjust your initial price."
