I understand its significance to you, and I am confident it will bring great benefits to your endeavors. After careful consideration, I propose to sell this product to you for $950,000.

I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and offers an excellent opportunity for both parties involved. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of concluding this transaction soon. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John.  There's a chance John might be willing to lower his price to be competitive with Alice's offer."
