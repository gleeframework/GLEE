{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price for Bob, leaving him some room to negotiate.  It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $95? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate you're working within a budget, $95 is unfortunately too low for me. Would you consider $105? That would still be a good price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still below my minimum target, it's close enough and a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $120."
