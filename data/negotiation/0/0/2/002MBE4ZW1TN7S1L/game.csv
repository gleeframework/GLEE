"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to discuss the product further, but I'd like to start at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your initial offer of $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000, Bob. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is still a bit below my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product, and it's also the price another seller is offering me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
