Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I think $1,425,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my target price and your last offer, which is $1,350,000. Can you consider this price?

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly anchored at $1,350,000. Accepting ensures a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation risks losing him entirely."
