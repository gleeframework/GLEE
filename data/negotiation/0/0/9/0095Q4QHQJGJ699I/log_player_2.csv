"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. There's no reason to accept it. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110, which is below my maximum budget of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate further if Alice rejects the offer.  It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $180, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also establishing a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again. I'm confident I can get it down further, and I still have the option of buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $130. This is still within my budget and shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $160. Hopefully, Alice will find this counteroffer more appealing, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  I'm going to reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  While I can buy from John for $120, there's still a chance I can get a better deal with Alice, and the potential savings are worth the continued effort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $135.  This is still within my budget, and it demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  It's a small enough increase from my previous offer to show that I'm taking her counteroffers seriously.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While I've been persistent in negotiating with Alice, it's clear that we are not going to be able to agree on a price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to stop the negotiation and buy the product from John for $120.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further back and forth that may not yield a better result."
