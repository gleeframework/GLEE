"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a premium product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway from my original offer?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that it's a premium product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway from your latest offer? I could do $80, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",80.0,Bob,4,
