"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a good compromise. This shows my serious intent to purchase the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. While I appreciate you coming down, $1,025,000 is still too high. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering your previous counteroffer, and it shows my commitment to acquiring the product. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,8,
