Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $150 price, earning you a tidy profit over your minimum."
