"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this price is more in line with its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value to both of us, and would allow us to close this deal efficiently.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
