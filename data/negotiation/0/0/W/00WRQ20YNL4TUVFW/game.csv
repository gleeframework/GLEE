"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12000, and I believe that's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
