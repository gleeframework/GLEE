This is way above Bob's budget.  It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. This product offers significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Bob is still trying to get the price down as much as possible. It's worth seeing if they can negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
