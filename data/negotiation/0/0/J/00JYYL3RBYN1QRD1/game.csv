"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. This product offers significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? ",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
