{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been looking for. I'm happy to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price that is above my minimum, but also leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I'm hopeful Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects and to sell to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to make the sale."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $100. Could you do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $95 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. I'd rather get $95 than $80, and there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price in future rounds."
