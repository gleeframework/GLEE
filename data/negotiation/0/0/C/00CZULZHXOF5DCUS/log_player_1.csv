Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get a good price for the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept $12,000, as that's my minimum value and I'd be making no profit. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept it.  If he doesn't, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm also concerned that he's not serious about making a fair deal. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell to John."
