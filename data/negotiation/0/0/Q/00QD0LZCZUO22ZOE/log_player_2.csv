"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but also puts pressure on Alice to come down from her initial price.  This is a substantial drop from her offer, and it's likely to spark further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still more expensive than Bob's counteroffer.  Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has also shown flexibility.  There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties, so Bob should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about a deal but is still pushing for a good price.  Increasing the offer by a smaller amount this time can help to encourage Alice to accept, as it demonstrates a move towards compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He has already shown flexibility and is likely to be able to get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  He wants to try and squeeze out a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about making a deal but still wants to save money. This offer is a compromise between the two previous offers.  It's a strong position to potentially close the deal. If Alice accepts, Bob gets a good price. If she rejects, he can consider his options with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's clearly willing to negotiate, she's not coming down quickly enough. Bob has shown flexibility and is confident he can get a better deal.  He's likely to reach a point where he will be willing to accept a slightly higher price, but not quite yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating persistence and a willingness to compromise.  He's getting closer to Alice's last offer and showing he's serious about finding a solution.  This offer should put pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal altogether.  If she rejects, Bob will have to decide if buying from John is a better option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob only has one round left.  There's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer, leaving him with no deal and no product. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product, even if it's at a higher price.  

Given that John is willing to sell the product at $1,500,000, and Alice is currently offering at $1,300,000, it seems unlikely that she will come down to a price lower than $1,300,000 within one round of negotiations.  It's wiser to secure the product now rather than risk losing the deal completely."
