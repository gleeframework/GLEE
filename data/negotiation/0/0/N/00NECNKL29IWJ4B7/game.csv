"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired price.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price, and I'll accept $14000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $13500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to meet in the middle.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
