"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,100,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need $1,075,000 to make it worth my while. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
