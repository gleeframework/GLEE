Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $145 offer leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** You're still ensuring a profit above your $150 minimum if Bob accepts. 
* **Time Value:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit."
