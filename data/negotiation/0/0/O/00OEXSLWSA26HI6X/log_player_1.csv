Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially going as high as $14,500. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring a profitable outcome regardless."
