"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
