"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer of $9,000, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This sets the negotiation in motion and allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price. It's important to remember that Bob has a fallback option with John, so he's not afraid to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best move. Bob is still confident he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer.  He's raised his counteroffer to $9,500, testing the waters to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway.  This offer is still below his maximum budget, but it shows he's serious about closing a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still not ideal.  He's been able to get her down significantly from her initial price, and there's a chance he can do even better.  By rejecting and counter-offering, he can continue to pressure Alice and see if she's willing to go even lower.  Furthermore, Bob has a fallback option with John, so he's not under pressure to accept a price that's not satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making his final push. He knows that his maximum budget is $10,000, so he's offering the full amount. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. If Alice accepts, he's secured a decent deal. If she rejects, he can always go to John and buy the product for the same price."
