"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a $200,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only afford $1,150,000 right now. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while keeping me within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's very close, and it's likely that Alice is firm on this price.  Since Bob has a backup option with John, he can reject Alice's offer and see if he can get a slightly better price. If he can't, he can always buy from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000. It's getting close to what I can afford.  However, I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
