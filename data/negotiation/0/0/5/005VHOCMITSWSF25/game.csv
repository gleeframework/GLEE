"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the competitive starting price, but I'm looking to get a slightly better deal. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is my best offer for now.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we settle on $862,500? It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can sell the product to you for $887,500. This is my final offer for now, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",887500.0,Alice,5,
