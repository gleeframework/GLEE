"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is less than John's price, it's still above your $120 limit. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or see if John might come down a bit."
