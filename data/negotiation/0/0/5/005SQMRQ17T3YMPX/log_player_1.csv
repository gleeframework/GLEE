"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my valuation and Bob's. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value and uniqueness, I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level. 
* **Alternative:** The mention of John as a potential buyer, while not explicit, is subtly implied by the phrase ""offering it to you first,"" introducing a mild sense of competition.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is less than what you're asking. My counteroffer is $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a major loss.  I'll use the next round to bring the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's true value goes far beyond that. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial price, but I'm still well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reinforces the product's high value, aiming to shift Bob's perception closer to mine. 
* **Urgency:** By highlighting my ""desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its worth,"" I'm subtly hinting that other potential buyers might be interested if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect your assessment of the product's value, I still feel it's priced too high. My counteroffer remains at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has not budged from his $950,000 offer, indicating he's unlikely to significantly increase it. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Time is a factor, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid the risk of ending up with a less favorable deal. 

While I could potentially extract a slightly higher price from Bob with more rounds, it's not worth jeopardizing a guaranteed profit that meets my needs."
