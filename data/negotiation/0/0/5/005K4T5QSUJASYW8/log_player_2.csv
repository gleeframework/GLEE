"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our goal. We can try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and increases our chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Polite and interested:** We maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and signal that we are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to our target, we still have room to negotiate before reaching our maximum budget. We'll try to push Alice a little further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling to Alice that we're getting closer to our limit. 
* **Maintaining Interest:** We continue to express our interest and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Alice to continue the process."
