"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which reflects the product's worth to me while allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing for a fair margin for you.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for us to move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
