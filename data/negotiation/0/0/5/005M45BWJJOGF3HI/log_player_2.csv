"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is far beyond Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which reflects the product's worth to me while allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,750,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. It's better to reject the offer and counter again, hoping to find a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing for a fair margin for you.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement in this negotiation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product and I value our discussions. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has stated this is her final offer and she has another buyer. This indicates she is unlikely to budge further. Bob is still over his budget and has already gone through several rounds.  It's time to move on and accept the guaranteed price from John."
