"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Bob's goal is to save money, and buying from John guarantees the best price."
