"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is significantly below his maximum budget of $10,000. By offering $9,000, he signals his seriousness about buying the product while still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a bold move, and Alice might reject it, but it's a necessary step to try and reach a deal within Bob's price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now within Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While he would prefer to pay less, accepting this offer allows him to purchase the product without exceeding his price limit. It's a good compromise that secures the purchase without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John."
