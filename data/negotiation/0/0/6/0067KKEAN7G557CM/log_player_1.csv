"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,400,000 is just slightly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  This might make him feel like he's getting a good deal while still maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to secure a high initial offer, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below your target price and his perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a better deal and are willing to negotiate further. 

You still have plenty of rounds left, and selling to John at this stage would mean leaving a potential $200,000 (or more) on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $1,300,000, you're still leaving some space for Bob to negotiate further, while also moving closer to a price that's acceptable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that works for you. However, there's still a potential $50,000 difference between his current offer and your ideal outcome. 

You have time and room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer while signaling that you're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value in this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To be completely open, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to close the deal right now for $1,275,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This offer is a very slight concession from your previous price, showing Bob you're willing to compromise, but not by much.
* **Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and importance. Bob now knows this is his last chance to secure the product at a negotiated price.
* **Still Above Goal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're still in a good position to walk away with a significant profit by selling to John."
