"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still a bit stretched. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value in this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To be completely open, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to close the deal right now for $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
