{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's a strong opening:** The price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can afford to drop the price slightly if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  The high price demonstrates you're not desperate for a quick sale.

Remember, you can always switch to John if you feel the negotiation isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're comfortable with. While it's tempting to accept, you still have room for negotiation and can potentially get a better deal.  

You have two options:

1. **Counteroffer:**  You can make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than your initial offer. This shows flexibility and could lead to a compromise. 
2. **Sell to John:** You are guaranteed a high price from John. However, if you feel confident in negotiating a better price with Bob, it might be worth exploring that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counter with $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer provides a few benefits:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:** You're getting a price that is significantly higher than what Bob initially offered, and closer to your desired range.
* **It maintains room for negotiation:** If Bob counters again, you can adjust your offer slightly while still maintaining a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and he's threatening to walk away. It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. While negotiating further might be possible, it's a risk that could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal. 

Selling to John guarantees a high price and a certain sale. It's the safest and most profitable option in this situation."
