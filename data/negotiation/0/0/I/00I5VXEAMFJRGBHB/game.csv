"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I can do $725,000 for it. That's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
