"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to discuss the product further but I'd like to start with a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's value to both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $13,000 for the product. This is a middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's meet in the middle on this.",12000.0,Bob,4,
