Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $77.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $82.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and while we could likely negotiate her down a little further, the difference at this point is probably not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. Accepting at $82.50 secures a good price."
