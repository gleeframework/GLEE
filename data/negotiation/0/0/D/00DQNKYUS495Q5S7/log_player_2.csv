"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for improvement.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that aligns with my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily decreasing the price and is now at $1,120,000. While this is still above his initial counteroffer, it's a good deal considering that John is selling the product for $1,500,000.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could result in Alice becoming more firm on her price or even walking away.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing the opportunity."
