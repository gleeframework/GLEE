"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price still reflects the significant value it holds for you, but it's the lowest I can go. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1120000.
