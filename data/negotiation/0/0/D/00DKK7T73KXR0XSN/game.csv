,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product offers. Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
