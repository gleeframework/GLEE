"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it will be incredibly beneficial for you, even more so than the apparent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice or go straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000. This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John, since John is offering it for Bob's maximum price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
