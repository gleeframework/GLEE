"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Start low:**  It leaves room for negotiation but is still a reasonable jump from Alice's initial price.
* **Sound friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage a good negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. Let's counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 might be too low. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Show progress:** We're inching closer to a potential agreement.
* **Remain firm:** We're still below $80, ensuring we get a good deal if Alice accepts.
* **Maintain positive dialogue:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $77 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now at $82, which is a reasonable deal. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting at $82 saves us $18 compared to John's offer."
