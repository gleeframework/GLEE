"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $11,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued conversation.  I understand your perspective on the price. To be frank, $11,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to stretch my budget to $11,500.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal today.",11500.0,Bob,6,
