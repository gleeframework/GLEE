Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, offering a potential return well above the price I'm proposing. I'm asking for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:**  This offer is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000), but leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a higher price.
* **Message:** I frame the offer as mutually beneficial, highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. This encourages a positive response and sets the stage for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a strong offer, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal his willingness to negotiate.
* **Establish a higher starting point:** This increases the likelihood of reaching a price closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Maintain leverage:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can still negotiate or switch to John, guaranteeing a minimum return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still above my minimum value, it's significantly lower than my ideal outcome and my initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, I show Bob I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to negotiate further.
* **Potentially increase the price:** A counteroffer gives me the opportunity to push for a higher price, closer to my target. 
* **Evaluate the situation:** It allows me to assess Bob's true willingness to pay and whether he's a serious buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I will now formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his current offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident this product's unique value will significantly benefit your business. While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,200,000 to reflect its true worth. This would be a win-win scenario, allowing you to secure a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the win-win potential. This keeps the conversation focused on the benefits, not just the price. 
* **Flexibility:** I leave room for further negotiation by suggesting finding a price that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm:

* **Testing the waters:** This gives me a better understanding of Bob's true negotiating range.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** It signals my willingness to compromise while still pursuing a higher price.
* **Maintaining control:**  I haven't closed the door on John's offer if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is close to my desired price.  Accepting his offer allows me to:

* **Secure a profitable sale:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000 and will ensure a good return on the product.
* **End the negotiation:** Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation, which could lead to delays or a lower final price.
* **Avoid risks:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob could walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,000,000. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances and Bob's final offer, accepting his proposal is the most logical and profitable decision."
