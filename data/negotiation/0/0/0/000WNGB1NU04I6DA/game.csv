"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal without further delay.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
