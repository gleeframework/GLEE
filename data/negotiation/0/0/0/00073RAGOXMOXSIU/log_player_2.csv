Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $105. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105. While she might come down a little more, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. You can get the product for $100 from John, which is your target price."
