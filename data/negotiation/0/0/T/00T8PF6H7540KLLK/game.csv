"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I have a budget to stick to. How about we bring the price down a bit?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to offer you $1,350,000. I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I still need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $1,390,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe this product is worth it.",1390000.0,Bob,6,
