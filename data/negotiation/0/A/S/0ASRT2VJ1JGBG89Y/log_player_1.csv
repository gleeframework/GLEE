Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his $800,000 valuation while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as time-limited and exclusive to Bob, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
