Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Considering its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to encourage Bob to accept the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 (John) gives me leverage to aim high with Bob.

By offering the product at $925,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit while acknowledging that Bob might counter-offer. This strategy balances risk and potential reward effectively."
