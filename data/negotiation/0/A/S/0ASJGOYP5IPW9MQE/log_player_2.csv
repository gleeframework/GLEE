# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  I know you're a discerning buyer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.  Please let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should reject Alice's offer."
