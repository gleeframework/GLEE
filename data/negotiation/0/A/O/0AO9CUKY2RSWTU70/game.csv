"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
