Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd accept $150 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a bit more profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $149 is just below your guaranteed sale price. It creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and implies a deal, even though it's just below your fallback option.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While Bob values the product at $80, you don't want to lowball yourself. Your offer needs to leave room for negotiation while still being appealing if he's willing to stretch his budget. 

This approach attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a potentially higher price and ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
