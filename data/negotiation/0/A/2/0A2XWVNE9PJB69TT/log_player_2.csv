"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's not worth buying from Alice at $15,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. It's a bold move, but  I'm hoping to incentivize her to negotiate, and it will make the final price closer to what I want."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I can get from John. I'll reject and try to push for a lower price."

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying from her. I'm still below her price, but I'm getting closer to a point where it might be worth it for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer is now at $11,000, which is only $1,000 more than what John is selling it for. It's not a great deal, but it's worth it to avoid the hassle of further negotiations. It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and I'm not interested in going back and forth any longer."
