"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $10,000. If you're willing to go that low, we have a deal! ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Alice,5,
