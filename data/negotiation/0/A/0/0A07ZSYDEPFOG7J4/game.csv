"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $155 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $145.",145.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160 is a bit low for me. How about we add a bit more to that, and I'll meet you at $162?",162.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $162 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach a deal.",150.0,Bob,6,,
