"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
