Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $710,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $85,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or raise the price again. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
