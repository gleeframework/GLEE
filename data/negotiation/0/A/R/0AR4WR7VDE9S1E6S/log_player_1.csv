Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, hopefully making him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you've indicated the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 isn't my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm not sure if I can get Bob to go higher, so accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point."
