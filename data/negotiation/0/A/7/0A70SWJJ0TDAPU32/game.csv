"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,200, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still too far from what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
