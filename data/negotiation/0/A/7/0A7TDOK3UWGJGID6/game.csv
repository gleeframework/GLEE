"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product. Let's meet in the middle and work towards a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's very close to your last offer. I believe we can close the deal if we meet halfway on this last step. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
