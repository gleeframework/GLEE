"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is asking for $140.  While this is a good price, you can try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum selling price of $120. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while also allowing you to potentially save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $15 more than her minimum selling price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, it's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation. You could continue to counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you might end up paying more or even losing the opportunity to buy the product from her altogether."
