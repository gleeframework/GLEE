"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob has a clear limit of $12,000 and knows the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, there's room for both sides to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum limit of $12,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also sets a clear price point that reflects his value for it. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely achieve a lower price by continuing to counteroffer, especially considering that Alice is eager to sell.  Buying from John for $12,000 is always an option, but Bob should try to see if he can get a better price from Alice before going that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise. This price is still within his budget, but also closer to Alice's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to meet halfway. The goal is to find a middle ground that both parties are comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to her value of $15,000, indicating she might be becoming more resistant to negotiating further. While Bob could continue counteroffering, the risk of reaching an impasse and losing the deal increases. 

Given the limited rounds, it's prudent for Bob to secure the product at his maximum limit of $12,000 from John. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the potential risk of exceeding his budget or failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
