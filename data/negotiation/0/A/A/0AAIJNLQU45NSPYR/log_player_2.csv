Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000. Since you can buy the product from John for $12,000, it makes the most sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John. You save $1,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
