"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. That's the lowest I can go.",13000.0,Alice,7,
