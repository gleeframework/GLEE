Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

Reason: Alice has stated this is her final offer and she won't go below $11,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $1,000."
