"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth for both of us. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $825,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $825,000 is a reasonable starting point, I would like to propose $800,000 as a compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product to me while allowing you to receive a fair return for your efforts. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,4,
