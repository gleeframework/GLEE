"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,200 is close, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,900?  This is a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",8900.0,Bob,6,
