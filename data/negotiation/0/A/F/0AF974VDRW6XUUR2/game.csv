"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $875,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the maximum I can go, and I hope you can understand my position. Would you be willing to accept this counteroffer?",825000.0,Bob,4,
