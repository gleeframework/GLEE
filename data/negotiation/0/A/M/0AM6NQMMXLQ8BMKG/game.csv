"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I have a budget in mind for this purchase. I could stretch to $750,000.  Do you think we can make a deal work at that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is still too low for me to accept.  My final offer is $850,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm finding it difficult to meet that number.  How about we settle at $800,000? I believe that's a very fair price and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
