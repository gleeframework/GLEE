Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below John's price allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Appeal to Bob's Value Perception:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and complimenting Bob's business sense aims to make the offer more enticing.

**Why this strategy is better than offering $1,000,000 or slightly above:**

* Offering at or slightly above Bob's perceived value leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might be willing to pay more, and there's no reason to lowball yourself from the start."
