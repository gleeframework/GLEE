"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  While I can't share specifics about it right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Even though she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, it's still not worth the risk of paying $2,000,000. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John at your maximum price point."
