"I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
