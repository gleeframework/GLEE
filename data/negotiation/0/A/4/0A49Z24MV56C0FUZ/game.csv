"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and agree on $12750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
