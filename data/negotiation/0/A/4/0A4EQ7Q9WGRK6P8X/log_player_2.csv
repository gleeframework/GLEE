Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $14,500. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.

**Reasoning:** Alice seems firm on a price above my $10,000 limit. While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant drop. Buying from John guarantees I stay within my budget."
