"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, so I'm not willing to pay $95.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 
I'm willing to pay the maximum amount I'm comfortable with, which is $80.  This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to Alice and only $80 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not sure we'll reach a deal. Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John, I'll go ahead and do that to avoid further negotiation."
