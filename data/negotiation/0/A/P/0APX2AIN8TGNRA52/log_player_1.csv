$140 is getting closer, but I'm going to try to push for $145. It's only $5 more than Bob's offer, but every dollar counts!"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $141
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$141 is a decent price and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept Bob's offer than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for less."
