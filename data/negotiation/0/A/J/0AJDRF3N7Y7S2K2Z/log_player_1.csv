"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still within my minimum acceptable range. This allows room for negotiation while demonstrating that I'm serious about selling to him. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his stated value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about the product by pushing a little further in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate that. I'm only willing to go down to $132. This would allow me to still make a decent profit while being fair to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $129. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $129 is close to my minimum, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further. With John offering me a guaranteed $150, it's more profitable for me to sell to him at this point, avoiding further negotiation and potential risks."
