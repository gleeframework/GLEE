Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. It's time to take John's offer and avoid wasting further time."
