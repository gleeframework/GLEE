"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason:  Bob can likely get a better deal.  The product is worth $120 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $150. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice is now offering $135, which is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's a compromise, Bob still has room to negotiate further and potentially reach a better price.  He can attempt to meet her halfway again and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is closer, but I'm still a little high.  How about we split the difference again and go with $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to a decision, but I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132.50? It's a small step down, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice is now offering $132.50, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $130.  While Bob could technically continue to counteroffer, it's unlikely he'll get much lower than this.  It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $17.50 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures the purchase and avoids further negotiation."
