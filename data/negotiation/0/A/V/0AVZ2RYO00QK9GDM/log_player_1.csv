Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
