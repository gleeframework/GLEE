"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to secure it at a competitive price. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Saving money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer."
