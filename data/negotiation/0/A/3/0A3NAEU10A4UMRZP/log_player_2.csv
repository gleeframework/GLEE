"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  $14,000 is still too high for him, and he knows he can buy the product from John for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000. By offering $13,000, he's showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to his ideal."
