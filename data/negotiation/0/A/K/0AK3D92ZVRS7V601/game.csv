"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
