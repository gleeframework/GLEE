Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds for you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This gives you a substantial savings while allowing me to receive a fair price.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.
