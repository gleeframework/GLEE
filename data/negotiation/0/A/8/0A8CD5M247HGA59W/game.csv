"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to only spend up to $1,000,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this price. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value this product holds for you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This gives you a substantial savings while allowing me to receive a fair price.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
