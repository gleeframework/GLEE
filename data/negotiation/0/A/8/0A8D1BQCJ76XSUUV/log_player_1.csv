Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and still get a good deal.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A high initial offer suggests you're confident in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to selling the product for $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's closer to your desired profit than selling to John.  While it's not your ideal outcome, it's a reasonable compromise and allows you to close the deal."
