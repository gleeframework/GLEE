"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair price to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This price would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really holding firm on this!  I can do $7,750 to avoid dragging this out any further, but that's as high as I can go.",7750.0,Bob,6,
