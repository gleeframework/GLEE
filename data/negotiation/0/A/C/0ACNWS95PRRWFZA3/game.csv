,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $125?  That's the absolute most I can do at this point.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go below 135. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let's meet in the middle again?",135.0,Alice,5,
