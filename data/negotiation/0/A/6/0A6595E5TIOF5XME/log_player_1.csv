"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $95. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to him and I need to make at least $80. I'm hoping he accepts, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is a compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $82. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and it's starting to get risky. This offer is only $2 less than selling to John, and it ensures a sale."
