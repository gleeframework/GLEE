This counter-offer aims for a price closer to Alice's perceived value while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,700.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but there's still room for improvement. You're closer to her value than your maximum, so you have leverage to push for a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we settle for $8,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 8500

```

This counteroffer attempts to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous one. It keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a more favorable price."
