Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is quite high, and $900,000 is a significant step down.  Could you consider $1,050,000? This reflects the true value while recognizing your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, $975,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and a fair compromise. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
