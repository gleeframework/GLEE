"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $160 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $160 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $145 is closer to Bob's maximum price of $120, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There are still rounds left in the negotiation, so Bob should continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $145 is still outside of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? I'm sure we can come to a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $145 was still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is the lowest she's gone so far, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $120. Bob has already rejected a similar offer in the previous round and has more rounds left. Therefore, he should continue to push for a lower price to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $140 is still a bit high.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I'm only able to go up to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $138. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob has rejected offers at similar price points in the past.  With only a few rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120. This ensures he gets the product at his maximum price point, rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
