"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. While this is a good deal, you can still get it for a lower price from John. You should reject Alice's offer and purchase from John instead."
