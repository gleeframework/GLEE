"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll reject and counteroffer to try and reach a more favorable price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a more realistic starting point for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If not, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm dropping the price slightly, but it's still above my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. At this point, I've reached my limit with Bob. I'm confident I can get my minimum from John, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
