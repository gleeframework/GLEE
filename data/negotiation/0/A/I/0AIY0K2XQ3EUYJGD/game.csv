"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $14000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $15500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $16250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",16250.0,Alice,5,
