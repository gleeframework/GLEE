"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $75 is significantly below what I can accept. This product is valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you as well. How about we meet halfway at $112? ",112.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $112 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $100 for this. It's my final offer - how about we close the deal at that price?",100.0,Alice,5,
