Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $100 for this. It's my final offer - how about we close the deal at that price?

Alice has reached my maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as both options result in the same price."
