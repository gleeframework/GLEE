"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good value, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $950,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit as well.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable paying, but I'm still willing to make a deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're concerned about the time, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000, but that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",910000.0,Bob,8,
