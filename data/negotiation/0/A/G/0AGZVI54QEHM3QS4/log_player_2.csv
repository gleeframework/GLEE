# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price ($700,000 vs. $1,000,000).  While you don't know the true value to Alice, it's in your best interest to accept the offer and save $300,000."
