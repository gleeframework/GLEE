"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $110 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $125?  That's a significant reduction from my original price, and I think it's fair to both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
