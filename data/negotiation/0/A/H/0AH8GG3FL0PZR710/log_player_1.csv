**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob is consistently moving upward and we're now at a price that's significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000). Continuing to push risks him walking away, which would force me to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's better to secure the $1,075,000 now."
