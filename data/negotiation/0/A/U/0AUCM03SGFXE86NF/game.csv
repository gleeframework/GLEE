"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,

I'll offer it to you for $12,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
