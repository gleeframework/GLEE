I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. I'll offer it to you for $12,500.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $12,500, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000. Take the sure saving."
