I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  I want to maximize my profits, but I also want to be reasonable and make sure the deal goes through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his offer. I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
