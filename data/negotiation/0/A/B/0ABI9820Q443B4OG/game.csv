"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1350000 to make it worthwhile. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1400000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be at a minimum of $1400000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price, and I'm willing to work with you to get to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at a maximum of $1275000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1275000 is enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1450000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price, and I'm willing to work with you to get to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be at a maximum of $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at $1500000 to meet my minimum requirements. I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price, and I'm willing to work with you to get to a mutually beneficial agreement. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to go above $1200000. I think we've gone as far as we can in this negotiation. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to reconsider my options and look elsewhere. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think it's time to part ways. I'll be considering other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
