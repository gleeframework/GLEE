"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,400 is better than $15,000, it's still above his target price of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $12,000 limit as possible. He's offering $12,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,800 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than his $12,000 limit. He has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice will come down further in subsequent rounds.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increasing his offer slightly from $12,500 to $13,000. This shows Alice he's willing to compromise, but he's still firmly below her offer. He's hoping this signals a willingness to reach a deal, while still keeping some potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is only $1,500 above Bob's target price.  At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal, and the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the negotiation collapsing is higher.  It's a good deal for Bob considering his alternative is to buy from John for $12,000.  It's better to lock in this price and avoid further risk."
