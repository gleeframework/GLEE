"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. To be honest, $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This takes into account your interest while reflecting the product's inherent value.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,5,
