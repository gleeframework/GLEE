"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

I'm starting with a price well below Alice's asking price but above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? That's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we're still a bit off. I think we can get her a little lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 might be a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're getting close to Alice's value, so I'm offering a price that matches it. This gives her a chance to make a small profit while still getting me a good deal."
