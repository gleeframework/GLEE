Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than what I consider the minimum acceptable value ($150), but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price while still leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, given the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to go above $120. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale at a higher price."
