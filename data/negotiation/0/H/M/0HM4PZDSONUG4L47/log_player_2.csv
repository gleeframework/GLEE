"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John, which would be his last resort."
