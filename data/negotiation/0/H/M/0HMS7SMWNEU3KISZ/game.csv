"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with something.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment from my side and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000?  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know if you're on board.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to come up to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
