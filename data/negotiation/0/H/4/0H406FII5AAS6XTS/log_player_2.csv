(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you might be able to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to see how flexible Alice is. This price is still within my budget and shows a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a better price. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $835,000 is getting closer to my target price, and I'm nearing the halfway point in the negotiation. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a worse offer from Alice outweighs the potential benefit of getting a slightly lower price.  I'm better off accepting this offer and securing the product."
