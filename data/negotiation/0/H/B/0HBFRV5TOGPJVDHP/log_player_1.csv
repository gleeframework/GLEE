Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth at least $8,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about a price of $10,000? Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. This information is powerful in guiding your offer.
* **Aiming High:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $8,000. This means you don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
