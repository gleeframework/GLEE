"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique and valuable product that I believe could be a game changer for you. I'm offering it to you first at a price that reflects its potential.  Let's start the conversation at $1,500,000.  This is a significant investment, but I am confident in its value."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial asking price to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However,  $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a good opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffers and reaching a deal that is too low for me is increasing.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome and a better strategy at this point."
