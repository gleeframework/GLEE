"Bob, I have a truly unique and valuable product that I believe could be a game changer for you. I'm offering it to you first at a price that reflects its potential.  Let's start the conversation at $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I am confident in its value.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However,  $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a good opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a reasonable price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
