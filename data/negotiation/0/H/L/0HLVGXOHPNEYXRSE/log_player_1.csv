``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter-offer.  By offering $900,000, I leave a comfortable margin for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm quite interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I won't accept such a low price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be doable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to make a counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too far below my target.  To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
