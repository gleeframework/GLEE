"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,500? That's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
