"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price Bob is willing to pay for the product from John.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a better price and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible while still remaining within his budget.  Offering $600,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a considerable amount of money. This counteroffer allows for negotiation while also giving Bob a good starting point for potentially saving a large sum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $725,000 is still a significant discount from John's price of $1,500,000.  While there's potential for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.  Accepting Alice's offer at $725,000 provides a substantial saving and a reasonable compromise."
