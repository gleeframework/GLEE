# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000.
