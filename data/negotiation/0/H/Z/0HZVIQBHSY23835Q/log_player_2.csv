Considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $15000. This price reflects not only its current market value but also the potential return on investment for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is for $15,000, which is your maximum budget.  Since John is also selling the same product for $15,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well buy from John."
