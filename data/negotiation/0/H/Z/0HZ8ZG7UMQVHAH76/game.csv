"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
