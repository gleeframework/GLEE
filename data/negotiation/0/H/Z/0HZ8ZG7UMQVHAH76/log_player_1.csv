Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer, indicating he might not be willing to move much higher. It's still early in the negotiation, and there's a significant gap between his offer and John's guaranteed price.  We should try to push him a bit further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,050,000? This demonstrates significant movement on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved significantly from his initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, we are still $100,000 away from John's offer.  We have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to John's offer, and we don't want to risk Bob walking away. By splitting the difference, we are offering a compromise while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  Making it clear this is our final offer adds pressure for Bob to accept."
