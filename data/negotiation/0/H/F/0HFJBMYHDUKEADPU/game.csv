"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I have to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",525000.0,Alice,5,
