"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is still significantly above your minimum, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?  This price still leaves significant room for you to profit, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
