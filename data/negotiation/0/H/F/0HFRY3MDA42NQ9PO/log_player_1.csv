"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is still significantly above your minimum, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
