"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to the $1,000,000 you're willing to pay from John. There's room for negotiation and potentially saving some money. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  While I see the value, $999,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your preferred price, and the difference between her current offer and your maximum budget is small.  Accepting this offer saves you $25,000 compared to buying from John, and further negotiation may not yield significantly better results."
