Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to explore counteroffers and see if I can push for a deal closer to $1,200,000."
