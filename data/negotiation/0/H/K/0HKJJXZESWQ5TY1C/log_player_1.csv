"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest level and adjust my offer accordingly."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I'm going to try and see if I can get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $900,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This should be a good compromise point, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."

{""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time.  John is a sure thing at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
