"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $25000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $18000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $18000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $22000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $22000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $20000?  This is my final offer.",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $20000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $21500. This is my final counteroffer, but I'm still open to discussing other options if you're willing to meet me halfway!",21500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $21500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $20500.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if it works for you.",20500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $21000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know!",21000.0,Alice,7,
