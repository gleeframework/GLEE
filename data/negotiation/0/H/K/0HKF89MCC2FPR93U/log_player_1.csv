"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is beneficial for me, but still leaves room for compromise. It's important to show confidence and express the value of the product while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price and my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $800,000. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a little high for me. How about $800,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's the same price I could get from John, and it's a fair price for the product's value to both of us. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
