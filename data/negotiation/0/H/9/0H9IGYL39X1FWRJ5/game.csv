"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $7,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $6,800? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $6,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm offering $7,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the best I can do at this point.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7000.0,Bob,6,
