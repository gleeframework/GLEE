"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I can come down a bit to $155. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $142.50 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.",142.5,Alice,5,
