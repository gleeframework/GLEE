"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($150) but still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good strategy to start high and be prepared to lower the price slightly if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I can come down a bit to $155. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $155 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round.  I need to try and push for a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $142.50 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $142.50 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $135 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds I can get closer to my desired price, or I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's try $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to offer $132 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're down to the final two rounds and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum.  I'm not confident I can get him to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150."
