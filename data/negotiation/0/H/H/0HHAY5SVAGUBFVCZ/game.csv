"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the product's value. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective positions.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a good price for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and leaves you with a respectable profit.  Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Bob,6,
