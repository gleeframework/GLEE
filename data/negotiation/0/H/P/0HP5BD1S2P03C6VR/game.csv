"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,750. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to close the deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
