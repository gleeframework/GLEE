Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I won't settle for less than $9,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $9,000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to try and get Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do better. How about $8,700? I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still not at my desired price point, and there are still a few rounds left. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about $8,600? I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I really don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not confident that I'll be able to get Bob to meet my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000 and secure a guaranteed profit."
