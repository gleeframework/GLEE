"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's still a fair price for this valuable product.",8800.0,Alice,7,
