Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There is still a $50,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Shows you are willing to be flexible:**  A $950,000 offer shows you are willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to consider your offer. 
* **Provides a good return:** You are still earning significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to consider the possibility of a counteroffer and the potential for a deal to fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $950,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially push for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should prepare a counteroffer that bridges the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.  Consider factors like:

* **Your desired profit margin:** How much do you still want to make on this sale?
* **Bob's perceived value:**  He thinks the product is worth $1,000,000, so a counteroffer closer to your initial offer might still be appealing to him.

A counteroffer of around $900,000 might be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, but still allows you to make a substantial profit. 
* **Maintaining your position:** You're not accepting his offer outright, showing that you're still confident in the product's value.
* **Encouraging negotiation:**  A $900,000 offer leaves room for further negotiation and gives Bob a chance to meet you halfway.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a good profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than your desired price, it's only $25,000 less than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate carries the risk that the negotiation might break down. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation takes time, and you could be losing the opportunity to sell the product and move on.
* **Opportunity cost:** While $875,000 is less than you initially hoped for, it's still a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John for $800,000.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision."
