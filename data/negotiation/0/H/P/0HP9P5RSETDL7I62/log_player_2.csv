"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price for Bob. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high. It's better to accept the offer and save $250,000."
