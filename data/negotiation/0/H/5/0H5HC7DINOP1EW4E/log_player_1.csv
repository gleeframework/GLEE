{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to potentially negotiate.  However, it's also close enough to his value to make it tempting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm looking to save some money on this purchase, and I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I will reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects a compromise from my original offer and is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's a good compromise and a win for both of us. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
