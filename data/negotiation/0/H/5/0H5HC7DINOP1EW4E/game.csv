"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm looking to save some money on this purchase, and I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects a compromise from my original offer and is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
