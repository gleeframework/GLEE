Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a better deal than selling to John. Further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price, and the risk of losing the sale completely is too high."
