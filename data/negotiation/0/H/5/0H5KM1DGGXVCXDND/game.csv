"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's still a good price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll pay $13,500 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
