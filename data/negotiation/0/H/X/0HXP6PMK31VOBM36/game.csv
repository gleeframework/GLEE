"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my budget. Let's make this deal!",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
