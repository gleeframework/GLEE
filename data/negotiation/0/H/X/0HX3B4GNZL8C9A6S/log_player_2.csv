"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product for $1,200,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential benefits will far outweigh the cost.  While I have another buyer lined up for $1,500,000, I'm confident this product will be even more valuable in your hands.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is within your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a much better deal with John."
