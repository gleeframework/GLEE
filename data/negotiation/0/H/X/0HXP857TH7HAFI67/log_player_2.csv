"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best option. It's still cheaper than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down much further."
