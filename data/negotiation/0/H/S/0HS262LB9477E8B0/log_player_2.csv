"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with tremendous potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it for $1200000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the price you're willing to pay. You should reject the offer and counteroffer.  This gives you a chance to get a lower price or walk away if Alice isn't willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about purchasing the product while still leaving room for negotiation. The price is also below your maximum budget, allowing for potential profit if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While $800000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is now equal to the price John is selling the product for.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You're getting the product for the same price as John, but potentially with a better negotiation experience."
