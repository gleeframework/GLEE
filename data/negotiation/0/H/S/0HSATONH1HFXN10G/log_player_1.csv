Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more to me than that, and I'm not ready to sell to him at a loss.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds. To guarantee a profit above my minimum, I'm going to sell to John. It's a better deal than accepting Bob's offer."
