"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $820,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this works for you.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $820,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $790,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this works for you.",790000.0,Alice,5,
