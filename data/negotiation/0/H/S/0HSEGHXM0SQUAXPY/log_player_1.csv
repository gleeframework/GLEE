{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives you a healthy profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the quick $900,000, it's not worth it considering my minimum value for the product is $1,000,000. It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob or sell to John as a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $1,050,000? That's a reasonable compromise, and it still allows you to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John to ensure I at least get my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
