Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. 
* **Potential for More:** I'm aiming for a higher price, hoping Bob values the product more than I do.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my offer to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** A price of $1,500,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my potential profit while still being realistic about Bob's potential interest."
