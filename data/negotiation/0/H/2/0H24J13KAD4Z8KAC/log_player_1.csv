Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can work out a price that's fair for both of us. My initial offer is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm eager to make this work and believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,250 is a good compromise and significantly more than selling to John. It's time to close the deal!"
