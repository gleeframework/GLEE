"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way more than I'm looking to spend. This product would need to be closer to $60 for me to consider it.  What's the best you can do?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  I could come down to $140.  This product is really high-quality, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a firm budget in mind.  To make this work, I can go up to $70. Let me know if that works for you.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120?  That's already a significant reduction from my initial asking price.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, to be honest, $120 is still pushing my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $80, but that's absolutely my limit.  Take it or leave it.",80.0,Bob,6,
