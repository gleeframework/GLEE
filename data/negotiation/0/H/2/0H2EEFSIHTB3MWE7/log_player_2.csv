"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly, rather than accepting such an inflated price.  We have plenty of room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way more than I'm looking to spend. This product would need to be closer to $60 for me to consider it.  What's the best you can do?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  We start with a very low counteroffer ($60) to signal our budget limitations and attempt to draw Alice significantly down from her initial high price. 
* **Gauge Flexibility:** This aggressive counteroffer allows us to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will tell us a lot about how the rest of the negotiation might go. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Even though $60 is very low, we have plenty of rounds to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  I could come down to $140.  This product is really high-quality, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice lowered her price, it's not a significant enough drop. She's still very far from our ideal price range. We need to show her we're serious about a much lower price point. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a firm budget in mind.  To make this work, I can go up to $70. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** We increased our offer by $10, demonstrating that we're willing to move upward, but also signaling that our budget is a serious constraint. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  By saying ""to make this work,"" we imply that $70 is our upper limit, putting pressure on Alice to consider it seriously.
* **Direct and Clear:** We're keeping our communication direct and concise to emphasize we're looking for a realistic offer from her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120?  That's already a significant reduction from my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Even though Alice has come down, $120 is still significantly above our $80 maximum and even further from our target price. 
* **Holding Firm:** We need to show Alice we're serious about a lower price point. Consistently rejecting offers above our range will hopefully push her to be more reasonable.
* **John is an Option:** We're getting closer to needing to consider John's offer, but we still have room to negotiate with Alice for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, to be honest, $120 is still pushing my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $80, but that's absolutely my limit.  Take it or leave it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at our maximum price point of $80. This is a firm ""take it or leave it"" offer, making it clear this is our final move.
* **Transparency:**  By being upfront about $80 being our absolute limit, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.  
* **Time for a Decision:** By Round 6, it's time for Alice to make a serious decision. We're communicating that we're ready to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
