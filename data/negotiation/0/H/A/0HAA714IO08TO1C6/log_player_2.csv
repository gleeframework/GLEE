"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product's value to her ($800,000).  There's definitely room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal with you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than her product's value. There's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal by continuing to counter."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,025,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's much lower than my initial price point and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially causing the deal to fall through is high.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's still within my budget."
