"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, so there's no advantage to accepting it.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  While Alice's product is worth $10,000 to her, it's worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and could be a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a savings of $500 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is present.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially prudent decision."
