Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
