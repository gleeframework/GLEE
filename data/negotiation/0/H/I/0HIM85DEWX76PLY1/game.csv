"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
