Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of selling to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer, so we're not desperate."
