"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair given my budget and the potential value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, $1600000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1800000?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1800000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1700000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1700000 is closer, it's still not quite enough.  I'm prepared to come down to $1650000. This offer shows a good faith effort to reach a deal, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and your budget constraints.  What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1650000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1625000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
