,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I'm very interested, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1400000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable, but I'm ready to make a final offer. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1300000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
