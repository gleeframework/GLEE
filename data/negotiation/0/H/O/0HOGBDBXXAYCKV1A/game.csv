"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me and allows for a profit for you.  I am confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
