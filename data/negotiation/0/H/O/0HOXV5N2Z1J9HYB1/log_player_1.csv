Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've been interested in! I'm offering it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This gives us room for negotiation without me having to immediately drop to a price I'm uncomfortable with. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it.
* If he makes an unreasonable offer, I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting a good price, I'll switch to John, who's guaranteed to buy for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for counter-offers:**  I have room to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a mutually acceptable compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to be unsuccessful, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $130, perhaps offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum. 
* I'll use a similar strategy as before, emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.
* I'll be prepared to either reach an agreement with Bob or switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great price for this product, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Still above minimum:** $115 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me some wiggle room. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us, which might encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price for the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or switch to John. 
* If I counter again, I might lower the price slightly, but I'll be careful not to go too low. 
* If I switch to John, I'll ensure I can secure a sale with him to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would it be possible to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $100 offer, refusing to budge. This indicates he's unlikely to change his mind, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price for me.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer and meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing John as a buyer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale for $150, securing my desired profit.
* There's no need to engage further with Bob, as his unwillingness to compromise has made it clear that we cannot reach a mutually agreeable price."
