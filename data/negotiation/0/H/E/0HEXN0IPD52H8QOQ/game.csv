"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $115? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112.50, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.25. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",111.25,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm not sure I can go any higher than $109.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there?",109.5,Bob,8,
