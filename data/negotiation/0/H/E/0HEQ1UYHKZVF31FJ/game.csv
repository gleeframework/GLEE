"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is my absolute minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $162.50.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $162.50 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $130 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $145? It's a fair price that's closer to both our positions.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $135 if you can do that.",135.0,Bob,6,
