"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you value the product at $100 and Alice is willing to sell it for $80, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the initial offer of $90 allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $90, while still providing Alice with a profit of $5. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal.  You value the product at $100 and can buy it from John for $100.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $13 and is a better deal than buying from John."
