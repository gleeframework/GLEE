{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation and making it likely he'll accept.
* **The message is friendly and open:**  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
