"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites a counteroffer, signaling willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I secure a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Gather information:** Bob's counteroffer will reveal more about his budget and how much he values the product.
* **Control the negotiation:**  By starting high, I set the initial frame for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can find a more realistic number. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While his counteroffer was expected after my high initial offer, it's crucial to signal that his current valuation is far too low. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means walking away and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value this brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Lowball:** The message firmly, but politely, rejects Bob's low offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** While still above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, the price drops by $300,000. This signals willingness to negotiate while aiming for a significant profit.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing, though not literally accurate, can be a persuasive tactic to encourage agreement. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As rounds progress, the risk of Bob walking away increases. The counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  This product is valuable, but to make a deal work, we need to find a price point that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased, but only to $950,000, which is still significantly less than my $1,500,000 minimum.  While he acknowledges the product's value, his offer doesn't reflect it. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to see a more substantial increase from him to continue engaging with Bob.  The risk of losing John's offer is becoming more of a factor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget you're working with. However, the gap between our positions is still quite wide.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,700,000 would not be worth it for me. I believe this offer reflects a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I acknowledge Bob's position but hold firm on the value of the product. 
* **Transparency:** I'm being more transparent about my minimum acceptable price without explicitly stating it. This conveys seriousness and urgency.
* **Significant Concession:**  The $200,000 decrease is substantial and demonstrates willingness to make a deal.
* **Call to Action:** The message emphasizes finding common ground, urging Bob to respond with a more realistic offer.

We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation. This offer aims to push Bob towards a more reasonable offer while leaving me options in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront:  $1,700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but only if the price is right. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair offer. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's clear from his messaging that $1,100,000 is likely his upper limit. This remains significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of bridging that gap are slim.  

Bob is signaling that he may walk away, and I'm unwilling to risk losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a profitable deal with John."
