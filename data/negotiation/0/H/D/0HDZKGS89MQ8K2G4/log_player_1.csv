Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be prepared to negotiate.  However, I have the security of John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which suggests he might be willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident that I can push Bob further.  Given that John is offering $800,000, it's a safer and more profitable option to sell to him."
