Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity with immense value. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,000,000,  $950,000 is a good price and we're only 4 rounds in. There's always a chance that I might not get a better offer in the next rounds."
