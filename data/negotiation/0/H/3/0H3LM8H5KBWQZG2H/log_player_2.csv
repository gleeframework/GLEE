{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's way above his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Bob is going to start by making his absolute best offer, knowing it's very unlikely Alice will accept it. He's hoping this will get the negotiations moving and set a baseline."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $10,000. He's got room to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob is going to offer $12,000. This is a significant jump from his initial offer, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but still keeps it below his maximum budget. It leaves room for compromise and further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still more than his budget of $10,000. It makes sense to continue to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is offering $14,000. This is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  It shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway.  It's a good strategy to try and get closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. The negotiations with Alice have gone back and forth, and Alice is not willing to budge significantly.  It's clear that Alice is holding out for a price that is much higher than Bob is willing to pay. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
