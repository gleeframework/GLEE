"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $18,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-end item at a competitive price. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product but would only be able to purchase it for $10,000.  This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price for it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm  grateful for your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still only able to pay $12,000. This is a fair price given our previous negotiations and my budget. I hope you'll consider my offer as a final compromise.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $13,500 again, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
