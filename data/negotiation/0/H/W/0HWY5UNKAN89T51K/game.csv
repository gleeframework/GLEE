"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $15000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
