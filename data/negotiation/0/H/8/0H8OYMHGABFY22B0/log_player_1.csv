Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate but also shows you're not desperate to sell below your minimum.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you some wiggle room to accept a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price.

Remember, I'm acting as a rational agent.  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his own perceived value. It is not in my best interest to accept this offer. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** Shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** Demonstrates flexibility and signals a desire to reach an agreement.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close to my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my target of $1,500,000, accepting this offer is still a profitable outcome.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John at $1,500,000, which would be a missed opportunity for a higher profit."
