Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing my belief that he'll like the product. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and reach a compromise closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect and aiming to build a positive tone for continued negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a fair compromise. It's above my minimum and only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. Accepting it ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
