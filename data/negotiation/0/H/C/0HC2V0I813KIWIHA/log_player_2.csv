Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to the price you want, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept for this product.

It seems like Alice is firm on her price and unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $725,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 offer."
