"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $750,000 is close, but I can't quite meet that. My absolute best is $700,000. If that doesn't work, I think we'll have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to the price you want, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept for this product.",725000.0,Alice,7,
