"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is just a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",100.0,Alice,5,
