Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is just a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.
