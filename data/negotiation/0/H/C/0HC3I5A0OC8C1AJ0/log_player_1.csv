{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to risk it and try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is just a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering Bob my minimum acceptable price, which is $100.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but it's still a good deal for Bob as it's the same as what he values the product at. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can close the deal."
