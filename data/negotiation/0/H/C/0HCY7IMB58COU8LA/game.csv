"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

This price is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
