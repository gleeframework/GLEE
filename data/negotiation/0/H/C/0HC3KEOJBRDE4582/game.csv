"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,000?  That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.",8000.0,Bob,4,
