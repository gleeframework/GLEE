Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to counter if Bob makes a lower offer, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel like the negotiation is going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell to Bob at my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to earn more than my minimum, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for me. I'm happy with what John is offering. I'm going to sell the product to John."
