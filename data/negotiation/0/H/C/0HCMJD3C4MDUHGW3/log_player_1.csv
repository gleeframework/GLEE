{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for the price, making the offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $9500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can secure a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we settle on $10,500? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet you at $10500. I would like to propose $10000 as a final offer. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still showing respect for the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's final offer matches my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. There's no further room for negotiation, and accepting Bob's offer allows me to complete the sale quickly and avoid any potential complications."
