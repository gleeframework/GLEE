Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer. I think $10,000 is a fair price for this product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  Let's split the difference â€“ $11,250. It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $11,250 is the right price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I think $11,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $12,000, I'm running out of time, and accepting $11,000 is still a good outcome for me.  I can't risk losing the deal completely and being forced to sell to John for only $10,000."
