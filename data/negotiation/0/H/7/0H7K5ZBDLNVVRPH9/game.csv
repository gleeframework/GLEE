"Alice,  $12000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9750. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $9750 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price considering we're both making concessions.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $9800. I'm counteroffering at $9800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",9800.0,Alice,7,
