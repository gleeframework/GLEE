"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  That way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving money:**  $13,500 is still a better price than John's $15,000, saving Bob $1,500. 
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer guarantees a good deal."
