"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. I am confident it will be highly valuable to you. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages a dialogue rather than presenting a take-it-or-leave-it offer. This keeps the negotiation door open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a substantial sum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message acknowledges the product's value, indicating a willingness to pay a significant amount. I'll counter with a figure closer to my target while still leaving some space for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to move from my initial position, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Value:** I want to keep the negotiation collaborative, so I acknowledge Bob's offer and understanding of the product's worth.
* **Conveying Flexibility:** By stating my willingness to move from the initial price, I signal flexibility but within reasonable limits.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  The counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a significant reduction from my initial ask but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. It aims for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating within a reasonable range. However, I'm not willing to settle for $1,250,000 just yet. I believe there's still a chance to secure a higher price by holding firm for a bit longer. I'll make a smaller concession this round to show flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's settle this right now - would you consider $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** I've introduced a sense of urgency with ""Let's settle this right now."" This could nudge Bob to make a decision rather than prolonging the negotiation.
* **Smaller Concession:** The $50,000 reduction is a smaller concession than before, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Final Offer Tone:** While not explicitly my ""final offer,"" the tone suggests that this is a very attractive price and a deal-breaker."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,280,000 represents a significant profit margin over my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiating Position:**  Bob has consistently increased his offers and is now very close to my last counteroffer. He might not go much higher.
* **Time Factor:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While I have time, there's no guarantee of a better offer from Bob later. It's better to secure a strong deal now."
