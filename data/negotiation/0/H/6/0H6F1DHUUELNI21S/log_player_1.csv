Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its immense value, I believe a price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale for that amount to John, you have a strong position to negotiate from. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,800,000) sets an ambitious anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you don't want to overtly threaten Bob, subtly implying there's other interest (by mentioning making it available to others) can encourage him to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase something he clearly values."
