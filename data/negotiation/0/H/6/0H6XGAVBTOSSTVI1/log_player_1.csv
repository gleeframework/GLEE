Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to decrease the price if necessary. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get closer to my initial target.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial goal.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a good deal and within my acceptable range.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether and forcing me to sell to John for a lower price."
