"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm testing the waters with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I believe this price might be appealing enough for Bob to consider, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
