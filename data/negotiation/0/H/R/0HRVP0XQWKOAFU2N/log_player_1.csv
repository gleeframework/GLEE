"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and above what Bob values the product at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiation to encourage him to counteroffer. This also shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Early Opportunity Cost:**  I'm hinting at the opportunity cost for Bob (potentially losing out on a good deal if he doesn't accept).

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can get Bob to come up to a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offers based on his counteroffers, aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob stall or don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($100), it's still below it. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I can still make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's, leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $100 is a sure thing, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with something slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his.  I'll continue to monitor the progress of negotiations and assess the likelihood of getting a better deal from Bob versus selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's my final price.  I think this is a fair deal, considering the quality of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price but not going down to Bob's offer. This demonstrates I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""final price,"" I create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he needs to act now or risk losing the product.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's quality reinforces its value and justifies the price point.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible while still leaving room for a potential compromise in the next round. I will be prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Selling at this price would result in a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  While I'm hesitant to go lower, there's still room for negotiation. It's possible Bob might increase his offer if he sees that I'm firm in my stance.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a potential buyer provides me with a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always secure a sale with John.

**Strategy:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I will aim to stay above my minimum. I will emphasize the value of the product and try to convince Bob to come up in his offer. If he rejects again, I will seriously consider selling to John, as there is a risk of continuing negotiations and ending up with a lower price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and it's the best I can offer.  I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $90, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's quality to justify the price. This subtly reminds Bob of the value he'll be getting.
* **Final Offer (For Now):**  I don't explicitly state it's my final offer, but I phrase it in a way that suggests I'm not willing to go lower. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my attempt to bridge the gap and reach an agreement. I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and comes up to my offer. However, I'm prepared to consider selling to John if he rejects it. I'm starting to run out of time, so I need to assess the likelihood of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum of $100. However, it's still below it, and I'm running out of time.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him potentially offering even lower prices in the next rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

While a deal with Bob at $87.50 is tempting, the risk of him lowering his offer further in the remaining rounds outweighs the potential gain. Selling to John ensures a certain profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
