Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial asking price. While I want to reach a deal, accepting this would be a considerable loss.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
