"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $7500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $7250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $7250 is a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's worth. Let's try to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about we try $7000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. Let's try to meet in the middle, but with a slight bias towards my target price. How about $8100?",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, but I need to be honest, if I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",7500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8250. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $7750, but that's as low as I can go.",7750.0,Alice,9,
