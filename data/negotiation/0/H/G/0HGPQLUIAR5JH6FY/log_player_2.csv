(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is far too high, so rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, half of Alice's initial price. This sets a lower expectation and gives room for negotiation."

While this is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. This should hopefully be a price she's willing to accept, but I'm still staying below my maximum."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this is very close to my limit, I'm still pushing for a lower price. We're getting close to a deal, and I want to ensure I get the best possible value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer once more, but just slightly. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal, but it's still within my budget. I'm getting close to my limit and running out of rounds, so I need to make this count."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is close enough to my limit and I only have one round left. I need to close the deal and save some money.  It's better than buying from John."
