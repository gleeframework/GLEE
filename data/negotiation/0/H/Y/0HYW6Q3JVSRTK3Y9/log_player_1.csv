Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob's offer is too low.  It's worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell for less than that unless I run out of negotiating rounds.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 4

While Bob's offer is closer to what I want, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
