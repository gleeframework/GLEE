"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) to establish a bargaining position. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses continued interest in the product while politely conveying that the initial price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is much closer to a reasonable price, it's still above John's offer. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Alice will come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90. How about it?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm aiming to split the difference between her current offer ($110) and my previous offer ($80). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still moving towards a price point closer to my goal.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message clearly states my target price range, keeping the negotiation focused."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to $90, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is a $20 saving compared to John's offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge much, and I might end up closer to John's price anyway.  A $20 discount is significant enough to accept at this point."
