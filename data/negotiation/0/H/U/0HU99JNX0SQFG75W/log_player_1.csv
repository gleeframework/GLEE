"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible.
* I'll be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers if Bob rejects my initial offer. 
* However, I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or goes below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.**  
* **I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still too low for me.  

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price to see if Bob is willing to budge. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** I'll emphasize the value of the product and the limited time available (remaining rounds) to encourage Bob to make a better offer.
* **Be prepared to sell to John:**  If Bob doesn't budge significantly, I'm ready to sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $9,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" for both parties to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited Time:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the limited rounds, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** I'm ready to continue negotiating if Bob rejects my counteroffer again.
* **Sell to John as a Backup:** If the negotiations continue to stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500. However, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, there's still room for improvement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but there's still a chance of getting closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a final counteroffer closer to my minimum. 
* **Limited Rounds:** I'll emphasize the limited number of rounds remaining and urge Bob to reach a final decision.
* **Prepared to Sell to John:** If Bob doesn't meet my minimum, I'll sell to John to guarantee my target value."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the price you offered earlier.
