"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and is a good compromise.  Accepting his offer means I secure a higher price than selling to John and will also save time and energy on further negotiations."
