Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $90 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $90 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message is friendly and to the point, making it easy for Bob to understand your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $80. I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum price, it's still worth exploring if you can get closer to your ideal price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $80. How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm happy to work with you to make it happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is slightly higher:** The counteroffer of $85 is a small increase from Bob's offer of $80, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also showing that you're not willing to settle for his initial offer.
* **It's still below Bob's value:**  $85 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), leaving room for a potential deal. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While you could technically continue to counteroffer, Bob has already moved closer to your ideal price. Accepting his offer at $82.50 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit over your minimum of $80, and it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly higher price."
