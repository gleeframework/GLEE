"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a substantial sum, I believe the product holds more value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob before considering John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth closer to my initial offer, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a better outcome than $1,750,000. I'll counter Bob's offer again before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to strike a deal. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,825,000? This reflects my willingness to compromise while still acknowledging the value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting too low.  It's unlikely he'll come close to a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option now to guarantee a favorable outcome."
