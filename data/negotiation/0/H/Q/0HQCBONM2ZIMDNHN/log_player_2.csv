"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to him, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  This price is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $1,250,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He wants to save as much as possible and has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining, potentially achieving a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value the product, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I propose a price of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating, but Alice is still above his desired price point.  While there's a chance he could further lower the price, he's already used up several rounds and the time is ticking.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and secure the product for his maximum budget.  There's no guarantee he can get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the deal entirely.  Buying from John guarantees the product within his budget and allows him to avoid further negotiation."
