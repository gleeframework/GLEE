"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a good value for the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,600,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
