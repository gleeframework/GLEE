"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get at least $11,250. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same number.  I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get the impression we won't reach an agreement. I'm willing to pay $11,100 as my final offer.  If you can't accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",11100.0,Bob,8,
