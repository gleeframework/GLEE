"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?  That's still a fair price for this great product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
