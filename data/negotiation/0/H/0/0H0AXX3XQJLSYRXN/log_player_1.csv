Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price is preferable.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of your backup offer from John."
