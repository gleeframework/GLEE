,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a strong offer, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure.  Would you consider $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
