"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $155. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, so I'm offering it to you for $147.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",147.5,Alice,5,
