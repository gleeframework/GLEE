,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, given its value to me. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If you're not willing to go that low, maybe we should just call it a day.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is still a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can make it work.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $95 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $92.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",92.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $94, which is just a dollar above your last offer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",94.0,Alice,9,
