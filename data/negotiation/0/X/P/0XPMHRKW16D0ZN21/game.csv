"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500000 to $700000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600000. Considering its value to me is at least $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I must stick to my budget constraints. I am unable to meet you at $1000000. I am proposing $850000 as a final offer, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's value to me and my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1200000. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my last offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with the product's value to me while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
