"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to meet in the middle. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
