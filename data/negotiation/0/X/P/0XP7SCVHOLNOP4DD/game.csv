"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hesitant. I could go to $75, but to be honest, if we can't make a deal soon, I might have to go with a different option.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",80.0,Alice,5,
