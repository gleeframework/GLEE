Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum ($10,000) and John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While Bob values it at $15,000, starting high allows room for him to negotiate down slightly, potentially landing closer to $14,000.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  If I ask for the full $15,000, Bob might see it as too greedy and walk away. This price is competitive while still highly profitable for me. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, I increase the chances of him accepting and me securing a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
