"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
