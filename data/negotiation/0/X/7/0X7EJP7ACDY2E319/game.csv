"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its market value.",12000.0,Alice,1,
