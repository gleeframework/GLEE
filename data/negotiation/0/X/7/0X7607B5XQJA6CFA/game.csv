"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $95? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,5,
