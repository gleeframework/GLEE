"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $750,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
