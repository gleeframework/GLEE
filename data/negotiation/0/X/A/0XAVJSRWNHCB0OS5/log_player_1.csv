Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It gives Bob space to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.

Remember, I'm playing as Alice, so my primary goal is to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or continue negotiating.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and accepting it would result in a significant loss. It's better to continue negotiating. I will counter with a higher price that's still below my minimum, but closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, while giving you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
