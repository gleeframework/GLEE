"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $200. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell the product for. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** Starting with a much lower offer ($80) than Alice's initial price ($200) leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a significant discount.
* **Target Price in Mind:** While your goal is to spend under $100, aiming slightly lower gives you some bargaining space if Alice counters.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a polite tone keeps the negotiation amicable, while clearly stating your price expectation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value of this product, I understand you might have budget constraints. How about we meet halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $140 is better than her initial offer, but it's still significantly more than your $100 budget and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to move down this much suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **Deadline Pressure:** As you're still in the early rounds, you have time to try and get closer to your desired price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $95? That's a fair offer, considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You're increasing your offer from $80 to $95, showing Alice you're willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""current market value,"" you subtly hint that you're aware of other potential sellers (like John).
* **Remaining Below Budget:** This counteroffer keeps you under your $100 limit while staying in a reasonable bargaining range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $125. This is my final offer, as I believe this price accurately reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Above Budget:** Even with her concessions, the price of $125 is still significantly above your $100 budget.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** John offers a guaranteed price of $100, saving you $25 and avoiding the risk of a stalemate with Alice.

At this point, accepting John's offer makes the most financial sense."
