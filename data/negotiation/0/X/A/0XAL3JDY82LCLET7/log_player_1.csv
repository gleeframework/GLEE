Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a reason (even a soft one like ""a great deal"") can sometimes make a buyer more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm still securing my minimum price with John. This strategy maximizes potential profit while minimizing risk."
