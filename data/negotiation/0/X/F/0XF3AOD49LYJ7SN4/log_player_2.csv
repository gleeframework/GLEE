"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. He should counteroffer and try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than the previous offer, $12,000 is still more than he wants to pay. He can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
