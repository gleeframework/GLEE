"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than her valuation of $800,000. There is substantial room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. Considering your willingness to pay $750000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer of $750,000 and leaves some room for further negotiation.  There's still a potential to get a better price, especially as Alice has already shown a willingness to lower her asking price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $825,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I believe a price of $800,000 reflects the fair market value of the product given its worth to both of us.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room to negotiate further. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting this offer allows for another counteroffer.  By continuing to negotiate, Bob might be able to secure a price closer to $800,000.  The threat of buying from John at $1,500,000 gives Bob leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a good return, but $850,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to go to $825,000. This shows a genuine effort to compromise, and it's a price that would be beneficial to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $825000. I'll counteroffer at $837500. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a fair compromise considering your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $837,500 is very close to Bob's previous counteroffer of $825,000. This indicates that further negotiation might be difficult and could potentially lead to a stalemate.  

Given the limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer is the best option to ensure a successful deal.  The price is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than the $1,500,000 price from John."
