"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That would still leave a good profit margin for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
