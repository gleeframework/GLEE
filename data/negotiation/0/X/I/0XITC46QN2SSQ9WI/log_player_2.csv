"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he has other options.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $18,000 might have been a tad ambitious,  how about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $15,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can afford to continue negotiating, as he has the option of buying from John if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
