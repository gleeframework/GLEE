Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this amount, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum price of $100, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I hope this price is attractive enough for Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum.  I'd rather get $95 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for only $100."
