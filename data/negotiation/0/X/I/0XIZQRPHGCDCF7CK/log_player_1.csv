"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's incredibly valuable and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for concessions.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help us understand how eager Bob is to purchase.  His response will reveal if he's willing to negotiate within this range or if we need to significantly adjust our strategy. 
* **Preserving the Option of John:** We haven't revealed John's offer, maintaining our ability to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below our target price and even further below our starting point. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a Strong Negotiating Position:**  We demonstrate that we're serious about a higher price and not willing to settle quickly.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:** By rejecting, we push Bob to justify his valuation and potentially increase his offer closer to our desired range. 
* **Time is on Our Side (For Now):**  We have several rounds left, and selling to John remains a strong alternative if the negotiations don't progress favorably."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for making a counter proposal.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a concession, but it's a calculated one. A $200,000 decrease is significant enough to show flexibility but small enough to keep the price above our minimum target.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to shift his focus away from his initial lower offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be.  If he rejects or counters significantly lower, we'll need to seriously consider our alternatives (John or a more drastic price drop)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. Here's why we're rejecting and continuing the negotiation:

* **Upward Trajectory:** Bob is consistently increasing his offers, indicating willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Limited Rounds Remain:** We're past the halfway point, so dragging this out too long could backfire. However, a few more rounds might be enough to bridge the gap.
* **John as Leverage:**  While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, knowing we have a guaranteed offer provides us with a safety net. This allows us to push a little harder with Bob.

**In the next round, we'll need to carefully consider our counteroffer. A smaller concession might be necessary to signal flexibility, but we still want to aim higher than Bob's current offer.**"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making a relatively small concession ($50,000), indicating that we're reaching our limit. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating this is our final offer, we're introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Above Minimum, Below Ask:**  This price point is strategically placed - it's still above our absolute minimum while being significantly below our original asking price. 
* **John in the Wings:**  While we haven't revealed John, the possibility of us walking away to accept his offer adds pressure to Bob's decision. 

**Outcome:** This strategy aims to either close the deal quickly at a price favorable to us or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay.  If he rejects this offer, we'll need to seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown his hand. After we presented a ""final offer,"" he decreased his offer instead of meeting us closer to the middle. This indicates:

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob seems anchored around the $1,850,000 mark and is unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Losing Valuable Time:** Continuing with Bob risks a stalemate and wastes time we could be using to finalize the deal with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees our minimum acceptable profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal."
