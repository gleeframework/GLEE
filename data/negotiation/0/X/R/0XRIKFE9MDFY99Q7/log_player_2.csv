"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's starting price is significantly lower than my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider coming down a bit?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. $85 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? That would still give you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to my target."

Round 4

{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a reasonable compromise, I think."",
