"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider coming down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $85 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the value I believe the product holds for Bob.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would only yield $80, while I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $85 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? That would still give you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By offering $102.50, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's counteroffer of $85. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair price.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get at this price.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I'm staying firm on my desire for a price above $85, as I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a reasonable compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still below my initial offer, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price or even a stalemate, which could lead me to sell to John for less.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be mindful of the time factor. Accepting this offer ensures I close the deal and get a reasonable price. 

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer at $95 represents a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale without risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a better price.**"
