,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?,16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $15200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15800. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",15800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $15800. I'm willing to pay $15400 for the product. Can you consider that?",15400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15400 and my minimum price of $12000, which is $13700. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13700.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13700. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",13000.0,Bob,10,
