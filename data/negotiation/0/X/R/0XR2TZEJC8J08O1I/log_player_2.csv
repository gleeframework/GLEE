"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. This gives us a chance to understand Alice's lower bound and potentially secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $115 is still above our target. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could we possibly settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We continue to inch closer to our desired price, showing Alice we're willing to compromise but not overpay.  This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price point well below John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $110? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While not ideal, $110 is a reasonable compromise.  We save $40 compared to John's price, and further haggling might lead to an impasse."
