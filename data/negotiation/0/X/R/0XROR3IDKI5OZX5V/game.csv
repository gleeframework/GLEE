,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $140? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",135.0,Bob,4,
