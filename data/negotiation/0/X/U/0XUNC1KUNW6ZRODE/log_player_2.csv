{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still above my desired price point. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer.  I believe this shows good faith in the negotiation, while also leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  Further negotiation might not yield significant savings, and there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible. At this point, accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
