"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $1,600,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to bridge the gap a bit?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1520000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$1,520,000 is a good price, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a decent profit, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John."
