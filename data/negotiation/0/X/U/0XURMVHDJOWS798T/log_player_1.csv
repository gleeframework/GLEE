Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build a good rapport with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that devalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
