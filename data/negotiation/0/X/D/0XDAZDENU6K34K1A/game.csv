"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
