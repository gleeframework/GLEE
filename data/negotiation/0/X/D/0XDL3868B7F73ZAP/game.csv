"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value the product at more than $1,100,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,162,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,162,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,187,500? This price is still within a reasonable range and allows us to close this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
