"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. However, I'm very interested in this product and I'm prepared to pay $1350000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. Let me know your decision.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1350000 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $1380000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
