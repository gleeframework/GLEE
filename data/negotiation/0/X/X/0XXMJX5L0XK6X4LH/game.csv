"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $102. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
