"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, but $1,175,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our ongoing negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
