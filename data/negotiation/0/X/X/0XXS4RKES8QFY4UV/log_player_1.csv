Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, but $1,175,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our ongoing negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the increments are too small to justify continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the guaranteed best outcome at this point, as there's no guarantee Bob will reach a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds."
