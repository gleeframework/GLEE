"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  I believe the true value of this product sits higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground here.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This reflects my bottom line.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
