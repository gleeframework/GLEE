Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  I believe the true value of this product sits higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still in a good position to negotiate. We've come down in price, signaling flexibility, but we're not going to accept anything below what we consider a strong profit margin. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground here.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This reflects my bottom line."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to meet closer to our price. Accepting his offer of $1,580,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the final price or reaching a stalemate."
