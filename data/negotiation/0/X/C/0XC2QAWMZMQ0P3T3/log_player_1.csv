"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it likely he'll consider it. It also gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $12,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob in subsequent rounds, or at least get closer to my target. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I believe there is still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still remaining above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the product's value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and  a significant improvement over John's offer. With limited rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a lower offer or a potential stalemate. It's time to secure the deal."
