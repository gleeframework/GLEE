I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also showing confidence in the product's value. I'm also emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm offering $11,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, $11,500 is below my minimum.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm proposing $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for me. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
