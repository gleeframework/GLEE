"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This still allows you to get a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. This would still allow you to make a good profit, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
