"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

While $130 is less than Alice's value, it's significantly more than your $80 limit and what John offers. You can do better!"
