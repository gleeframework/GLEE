{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification for the price:**  While not revealing John's offer, you hint at the product's ""exceptional value"" and ""long-term benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the invitation to ""discuss further"" signal to Bob that you're open to negotiation, making it more likely he'll engage. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal with Bob. By starting high, you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If Bob negotiates, you have room to lower the price slightly while still making a significant profit over his perceived value of $800,000."
