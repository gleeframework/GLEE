Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While a higher price might be ideal, Bob is consistently moving closer to our acceptable range. Accepting at $925,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation that might yield a less favorable outcome."
