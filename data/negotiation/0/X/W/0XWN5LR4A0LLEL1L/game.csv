"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential returns you'll see.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget,  I'm  willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and hopefully gives you some room to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial benefit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $900,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal. Let's try to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
