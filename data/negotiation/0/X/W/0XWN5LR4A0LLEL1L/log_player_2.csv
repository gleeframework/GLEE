"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way too high.  It's a good starting point to negotiate, but I need to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget,  I'm  willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and hopefully gives you some room to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still coming in too high. While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'll reject this offer and try to get her lower. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $900,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
