"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet all your needs and expectations. Considering its high value and quality, I propose a price of $7,500 for it. I believe this offer provides a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good price, it's still more than Bob's ideal target.  There's an opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about considering a price of $7,200 for the product? This still reflects its value while making it more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $7,500 to $7,200, which is closer to Bob's ideal target price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and then counter with a price higher than $7,200. At this point, it's better to secure the deal at a price that's within Bob's budget."
