``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to remember that John is always a backup option, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. This is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1650000. I'd like to propose a price of $1580000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get much more from him.  Selling to John would get me my minimum, but I'd prefer to get a bit more. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
