"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and her ""final offer"" suggests she won't go much lower.  Getting the product for $1,000 less by buying from John is the most financially sound decision at this point."
