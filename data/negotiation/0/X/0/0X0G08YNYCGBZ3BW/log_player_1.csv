{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's less than his perceived value) while still maximizing your potential profit."
