# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
