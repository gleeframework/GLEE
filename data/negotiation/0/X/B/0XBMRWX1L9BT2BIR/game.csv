"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so how about $800,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
