"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that much to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to bluff you by saying she has another buyer. Even if she does, you're better off buying from John for $1,200,000."
