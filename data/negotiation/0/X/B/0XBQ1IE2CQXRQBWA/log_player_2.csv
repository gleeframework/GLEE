{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but still within the range where a deal is possible.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about $115? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.

* **Negotiation:** Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has also adjusted her price. This indicates a potential for a successful deal if Bob continues negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob has increased his offer, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still trying to get the best price possible.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $112.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Bob is suggesting a compromise, which is often a good strategy to get closer to a deal. 
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  By saying he's ready to finalize the deal, Bob is showing commitment and potentially putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $110 is still within Alice's likely acceptable range, and it's close enough to Bob's desired price to make it attractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $112 is still above Bob's maximum of $150.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only three rounds left, the time for negotiation is becoming limited.
* **Guaranteed Price:**  Buying from John guarantees a price of $150, which is within Bob's budget and offers a known outcome. 
* **Potential for Stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a stalemate or a deal that is still above Bob's limit.

While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement or ending up with a price above his limit is high. Buying from John offers a guaranteed solution within his budget."
