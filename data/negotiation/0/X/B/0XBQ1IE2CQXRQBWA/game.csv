"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about $115? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $112.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it!",112.0,Alice,7,
