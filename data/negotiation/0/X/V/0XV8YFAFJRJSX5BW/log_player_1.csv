Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1300000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, but that's my absolute top end.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
