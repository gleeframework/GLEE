"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal at this price. Let's seal the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1175000. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's seal the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
