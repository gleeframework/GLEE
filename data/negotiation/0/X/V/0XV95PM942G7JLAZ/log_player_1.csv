Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is pretty much my limit, but how about $75? If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet your minimum price of $100. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
