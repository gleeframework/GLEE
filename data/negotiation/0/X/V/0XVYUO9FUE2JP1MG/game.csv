"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
