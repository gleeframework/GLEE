Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John gives me leverage. 

By offering the product at $140, I'm aiming for a price that's:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  Encouraging him to consider the deal.
* **Lower than my guaranteed sale price:**  Ensuring I make more profit than selling to John."
