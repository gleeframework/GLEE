"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which would be $1,225,000. I'm willing to go up by $35,000 to $1,260,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we meet at $1,235,000?",1235000.0,Bob,6,
