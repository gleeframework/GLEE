"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,400,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find a middle ground. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I can do $1,150,000.  That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
