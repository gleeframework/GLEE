"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm happy to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we discuss a price of $1,180,000? It's a compromise that should satisfy both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,180,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a truly mutually beneficial deal. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This price allows us both to achieve a good outcome. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000, but I think we can do even better. Let's try $1,165,000. It's a small increase, but it's worth considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1165000.0,Alice,5,
