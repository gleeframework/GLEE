"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $120, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm curious to see if he's willing to pay this price right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a little more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to make a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's only slightly higher than my minimum, it's still a profit, and we're already halfway through the rounds. There's a chance Bob might reject my next offer, and I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to negotiate before I have to sell to John."
