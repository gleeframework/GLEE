"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What are your thoughts on this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice's offer is $9,500.
* **There is room for negotiation:** You can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **John is a backup option:** You can always buy from John for $10,000 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice. 

**Next steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a price that is lower than $9,500, but still higher than her minimum value of $8,000."
