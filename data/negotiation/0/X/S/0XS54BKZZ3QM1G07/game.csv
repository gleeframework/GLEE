"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $2,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer, and while I recognize your perspective on the product's value, I believe my initial assessment was closer to its true worth. How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,025,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my part and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. To be frank, $1,900,000 is a bit lower than I had hoped for. However, I value our developing business relationship and I want to see this deal through. Let's settle this right now â€“  I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, Bob.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
