Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing your product and would like to propose a price of $10,500. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I have a good chance of getting a better offer with John, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,500 is still not enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I am willing to pay $10,600 for your product. This is the highest amount I can afford, given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,600 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. I'm aware I can always go with John's offer for $12,000, but I'm hoping to get a better deal from Bob. There's still a chance I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still unable to accept $10,600.  How about we compromise at $10,800?  This is a good price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $10,600. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob isn't going to budge much further, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. I've been unable to get him close to my minimum price, so it's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000. While it's not ideal, it's the best course of action given the situation."
