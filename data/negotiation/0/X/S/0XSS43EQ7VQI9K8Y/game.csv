"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny of my asking price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth significantly more, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Would you consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
