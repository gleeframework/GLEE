Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room for him to negotiate a lower price without you losing too much. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By including a friendly message, you're setting a positive tone and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's right at your minimum acceptable price.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. 

You'll use the next round to counteroffer, hopefully getting closer to your desired price.  If negotiations stall, you can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about $105? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin. 
* **Midpoint:**  $105 is the midpoint between your last offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone and avoids making the negotiation adversarial. 

This counteroffer increases your chances of reaching an agreement that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within $100. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $98 is too low. While you could counteroffer again, the negotiation seems to be going in circles. It's unlikely you'll get a better price from Bob, and it's time to move on.

Selling to John for $100 guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
