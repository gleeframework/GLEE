"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to explore if I can secure a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product brings, I'm willing to drop my price slightly.  I'm proposing $1,600,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,600,000 is still out of my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but it's still below it. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation and that I can potentially secure a better price by continuing the conversation with Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low.  Let's aim for a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with a lower price than what John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I'm comfortable with that decision."
