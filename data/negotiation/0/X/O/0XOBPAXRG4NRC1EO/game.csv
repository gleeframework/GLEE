"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant stretch.  Could you do $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
