"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $137.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $142.50. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",142.5,Alice,5,
