"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). It's more advantageous to try and negotiate with Alice or to buy from John at your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for bargaining. It's unlikely she'll accept this initial offer, but it will hopefully prompt her to counter with a more reasonable price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a price closer to my target. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still staying within a reasonable range. I'm hoping this will be close enough to her desired price point to prompt a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as we're getting closer to a possible deal. I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my budget, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  I believe this offer is reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal, especially since we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget, and we've been negotiating for a while. While there's still a chance we could come to an agreement, it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach a price that works for both of us.  At this point, it's more efficient to secure the product from John at my target price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiations with Alice risk delaying the purchase and potentially leading to an even higher price."
