"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  He's aiming for a price closer to what the product is worth to Alice, giving both of them a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a lower price. While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this price, as I'm really keen on getting this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his previous counteroffer.  He's trying to show Alice that he's serious about this price and is willing to stay firm. He's also reminding her that this price is fair, considering both their valuations.  The message also reinforces Bob's interest in the product, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept."
