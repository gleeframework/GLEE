"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob. Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly less than his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the price he'd pay buying from John."
