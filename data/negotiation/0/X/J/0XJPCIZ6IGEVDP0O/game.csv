"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1500000? It's a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let me know if this works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought it over, and I'm still willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm not willing to go any higher, so that's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
