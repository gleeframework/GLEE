"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.

"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still above my budget. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
