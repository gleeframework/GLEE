Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and potentially secure a higher profit margin. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations. If you had more information, you could tailor your offer for a more strategic approach."
