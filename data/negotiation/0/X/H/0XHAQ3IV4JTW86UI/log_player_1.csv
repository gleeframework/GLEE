"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows for some negotiation room. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to start a dialogue, and I'll be able to gauge his level of interest based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum value, Bob's offer is too low. I still have 9 rounds left and can potentially get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still a decent profit for me and it's a step closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."
