"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves some room for profit on your end. Let's make a deal!",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a significant profit margin and is closer to my desired price point. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still gives you a strong profit. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
