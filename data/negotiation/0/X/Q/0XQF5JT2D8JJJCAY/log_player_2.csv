"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. Since you know you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee. Buying from John provides a known, fixed price."
