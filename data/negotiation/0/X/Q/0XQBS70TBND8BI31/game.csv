I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. How about $92.50? That's closer to what I'm looking for.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have a firm budget, and $92.50 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to go up to $78,  but that's my absolute limit.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a firm budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but I'll throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary accessory that's worth $10. So, the total value you'll get is $88. Is that something you'd be interested in?",78.0,Alice,7,
