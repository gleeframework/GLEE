Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $150. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start higher, an exorbitant price might immediately turn Bob off.  $140 is a significant markup from his perceived value, but not outrageous. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to consider."
