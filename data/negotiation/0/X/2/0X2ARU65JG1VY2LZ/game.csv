,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.  Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for 100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $70. It's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of 70, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for 85. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $80. Let's meet in the middle at $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below 90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 85 and 82.50, so I'm offering the product for 83.75. It's a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",83.75,Alice,7,
