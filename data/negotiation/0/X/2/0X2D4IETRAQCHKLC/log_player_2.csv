"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is lower than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding with John if necessary."
