"Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $120? That's still a great deal considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,5,
