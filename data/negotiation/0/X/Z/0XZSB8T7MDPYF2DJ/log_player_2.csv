Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,875,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. I see we are getting closer.  To be completely transparent with you, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.

Alice is getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above my previous offer at this point.  I want to see if she'll come down further."
