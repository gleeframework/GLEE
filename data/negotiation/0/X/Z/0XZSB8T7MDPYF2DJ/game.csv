"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to move on the price. I see we are getting closer.  To be completely transparent with you, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would greatly benefit from this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being transparent about your other buyer, but I'm still only comfortable going up to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a profitable partnership.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
