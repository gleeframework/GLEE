Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product and the benefits it can bring to the right buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10500. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to the right buyer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
