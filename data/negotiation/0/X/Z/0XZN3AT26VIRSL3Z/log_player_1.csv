{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay more than John ($1,500,000 vs. $1,000,000). Aiming closer to Bob's valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still securing a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's specific value to Bob (""your expertise"") helps justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Market Information:** If you had more buyers, you might be able to push for even more."
