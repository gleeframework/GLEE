Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but still gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you don't sell below your minimum value.
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:** The message is friendly and open to discussion. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, we can potentially maximize our profit while also giving Bob a reason to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, we can likely do better.  

**Reasoning:**

* **We have a better option:**  We can sell the product to John for $120.  
* **Negotiation room:**  We can still potentially get a higher price from Bob than $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer puts us at risk of losing the chance to get a better price from him or from John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, we keep the negotiation open and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  I understand your price point, but I'm still looking for a bit more to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to keep the product moving."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Meet Bob halfway:** It's a compromise from our previous offer of $115 and above Bob's offer of $100.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** The message reiterates our desire to reach a deal and emphasizes a ""fair"" outcome for both of us.
* **Keep a little room:**  $110 is still above our minimum threshold of $120, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our minimum:** While $105 is closer to our minimum of $120, it's still below our desired profit.
* **Potential for better deal:** We have a surefire sale to John at $120. There's still a chance Bob might increase his offer. 
* **Risk of losing time:**  Accepting now means we might miss out on a better deal with John or a higher price from Bob in future rounds.

By rejecting, we keep the negotiation open and avoid settling for a price below our preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price for this product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is a firm stance, indicating that we're not willing to go lower.
* **Appealing to fairness:** The message focuses on finding a ""happy"" compromise, emphasizing a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Still above our minimum:**  $110 is still above our minimum of $120, providing a buffer if Bob pushes back further.

We're holding firm at our previous counteroffer, aiming to persuade Bob to accept a price that's still beneficial for us."
