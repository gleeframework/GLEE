"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's no harm in seeing if she'll come down on her price. The worst that can happen is she refuses and you buy from John for the same amount."
