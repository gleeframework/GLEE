Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob. This helps establish a positive rapport and encourage a negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message doesn't close the door on further negotiation, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob. I'm willing to negotiate but also have a safety net of John's offer if Bob rejects my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price than $8,500 by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  Having John's offer of $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position, meaning I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a significant discount and a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-Ended:** The message ends with a question, leaving room for further dialogue and encouraging Bob to respond.

This counteroffer balances the need to reach an agreement with the goal of maximizing profit. It gives Bob a chance to accept a price that's closer to his original offer while still allowing me to earn more than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below it.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a price that's too low for me.  There's a risk he'll keep lowering his offer, and I might end up with a deal significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $12,000 guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements. It provides a safer and more certain outcome.

While I'd like to maximize my profit, I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed outcome. Selling to John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob and ensures I achieve my minimum financial goal."
