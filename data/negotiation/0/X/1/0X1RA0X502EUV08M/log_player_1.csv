"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to make concessions. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value of the product and frames the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I end by asking for Bob's feedback, showing flexibility and openness to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting would lead to a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's shown interest in the product and is willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting his offer, I can demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price and potentially push him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Within Range:** My counteroffer of $8,250 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($7,500) and my desired price ($9,000). 
* **Reinforce Value:** I reiterate that Bob's initial offer is too low, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Positive and Fair Tone:**  The message uses positive language and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Progress in Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is still too low, he has increased his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** If I'm unable to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob, selling to John for $8,000 remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. Your latest offer is a bit closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we try $8,000?  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is my final compromise, matching my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce the fairness of my offer.
* **Direct and Confident:** The message is direct and confident,  showing that I'm serious about achieving this price. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  By proposing a price that meets my minimum, I'm hoping to close the deal and avoid the need to sell to John."
