"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my limit, I'm not going to rush into buying at that price.  I'll counter again and see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  While $12,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $14,500. This offer stands as a sign of good faith and my desire to see you benefit from this product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm going to counter again and see if we can settle on a price closer to $12,000. I still have several rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."

Round 6
