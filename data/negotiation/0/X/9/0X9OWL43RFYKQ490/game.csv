"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal.  While $12,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $14,500. This offer stands as a sign of good faith and my desire to see you benefit from this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I really appreciate your continued negotiation. While $14,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  I truly believe this product is worth it for me, and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
