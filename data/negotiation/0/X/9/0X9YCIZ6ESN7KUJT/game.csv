"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
