"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum ($2,200,000) sets a strong anchor.  This may shift Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal that is favorable for me.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, but I want to aim higher with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, it's still early in the negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, offering a price above his initial valuation. Rejecting now gives me the opportunity to:

* **Gauge Bob's Flexibility:**  His counter-offer will reveal how much he's willing to move from his initial price. 
* **Maintain a Higher Target:** I still aim to secure a price closer to my initial ask. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value goes beyond that. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000?  This reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial offer ($300,000), demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:**  However, I'm not meeting Bob in the exact middle.  My new price is still significantly higher than his offer, reflecting my belief in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief justification (""true worth""), reinforcing the idea that my price isn't arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet at $1,600,000? I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Potential Upside:** While $1,600,000 is closer to John's offer, there's still a significant gap between Bob's current offer and my target.
* **Negotiating Power:**  It's still relatively early in the negotiation (round 4 out of 10). I have time for a few more counteroffers to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution â€“ how about $1,750,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,600,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,900,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that I'm making a substantial move, putting pressure on Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Framing Fairness:**  I've positioned the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" subtly encouraging Bob to view it as a win-win solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet at $1,600,000 was too high, let's try $1,550,000? I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll move significantly beyond this point.
* **Time Factor:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away. 
* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,550,000 is a solid profit above my minimum, and it's better to secure this deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
