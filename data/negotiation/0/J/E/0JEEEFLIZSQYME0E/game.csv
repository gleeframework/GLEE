,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $200 is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 was a bit ambitious, how about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a high-quality product that you won't regret.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand the product is good quality, but $160 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140. It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
