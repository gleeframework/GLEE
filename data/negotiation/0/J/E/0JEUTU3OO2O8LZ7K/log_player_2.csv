"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget than $18,000, he is still over his maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm happy to meet you at $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $15,500 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.** Alice has already made several compromises, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower.
* **John offers a better deal.** John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which is the best price Bob can get. 

It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
