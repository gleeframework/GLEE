Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer.  It also ensures I earn more than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $105, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum price. This could potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm really interested in the product, and this price works for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has reached it.  While I could try to push for a little more, there's no guarantee he'll budge further, and I risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum and avoid the potential risk of getting a lower price or even no sale."
