Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and might even lead to a better outcome than expected.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, we can adjust our approach.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option to sell to John for $100, so we don't want to accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly lower than both our minimum acceptable price ($100) and our initial offer. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's message indicates interest and a willingness to negotiate. By countering, we can try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as backup:** We still have the option to sell to John for our minimum price if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but hold firm:** We're showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price, but we're still holding firm above our minimum ($100).
* **Split the difference:**  Suggesting $120 represents a compromise by splitting the difference between his offer ($80) and our previous ask ($150).  This can be a strong negotiation tactic, as it feels fair to both parties. 
* **Maintain John as backup:**  We're still above our minimum, so we haven't jeopardized our ability to sell to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable profit:**  $110 is above our minimum acceptable price of $100, securing a profit.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time value:**  Reaching a deal now means we avoid further back-and-forth and potentially missing out on other opportunities."
