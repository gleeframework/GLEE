``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully settle on a price that's closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While it's closer, I'm not willing to sell for that amount yet. I'll see if I can get him closer to my price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. At this point, I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement with Bob. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
