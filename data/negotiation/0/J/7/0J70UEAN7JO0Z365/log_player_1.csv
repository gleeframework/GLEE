Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering the product slightly above what I know it's worth to Bob, hoping he'll accept.  I also have a backup plan to sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $95 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $95 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to pay $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from my minimum acceptable price. I believe $105 is still reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I am not willing to go beyond $98 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and while I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to move on."
