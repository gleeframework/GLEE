Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A starting price slightly below Bob's value leaves room for him to counter-offer while still ensuring Alice gets a good deal.
* **Time Value & Alternative:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling quickly to Bob at $11,500 is more profitable.  This strategy balances risk and reward."
