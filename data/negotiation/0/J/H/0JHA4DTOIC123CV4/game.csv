"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $950000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1025000? It's a fair price that still allows you to save a substantial amount, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's try to make this work.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
