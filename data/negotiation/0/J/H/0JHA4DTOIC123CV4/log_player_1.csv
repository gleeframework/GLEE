Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below your minimum but above Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Shows confidence:** A firm price suggests you believe in the product's worth. 
* **Is a good initial offer:** It's a reasonable starting point for bargaining.

However, remember:

* **John is always an option:** If the negotiations with Bob stall, you have a backup buyer at a higher price.  
* **Don't be afraid to be firm:** If Bob makes a low counteroffer, you can counter with a higher price or even threaten to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price and even below his perceived value.  While negotiating is good, accepting this offer would leave you with a significant loss.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Counter with a higher price:** You can propose a counter-offer closer to your original price, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Maintain your position:**  Rejecting shows you are firm about the product's value.
* **Keep the option of selling to John:** If the negotiation continues to stall, you can always choose to sell to John and guarantee a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to save a substantial amount, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** This counteroffer is a compromise that aims to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and your minimum.  It's a ""meet-in-the-middle"" approach that shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer but emphasizes that it's not acceptable while offering a counter that reflects a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects it, but it also reinforces your position that $950,000 is too low."
