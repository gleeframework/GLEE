"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This unique item holds immense value to us and, equally so, to you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. We understand its significance and would like to extend to you an exclusive offer to purchase it at a special price. Our proposal is to sell it to you for $750,000. This is an exceptional chance to secure this valuable asset at a highly competitive rate. We believe this price reflects the quality and importance of the product while allowing us to maximize its value. We look forward to your positive response and the possibility of making this transaction a reality.

Alice's offer of $750,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $800,000 and it saves you $50,000. Even though you can buy the product from John for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer is the better option as it saves you money."
