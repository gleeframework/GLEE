"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Showing confidence:**  A bold opening price demonstrates confidence in the product's value and my negotiation skills.
* **Open to discussion:**  My message is friendly and open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter. 
* **Room for compromise:**  While $18,000 is higher than Bob's ideal, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $14,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, I still have several rounds to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Having John's offer as a fallback option gives me more leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a middle ground:**  I'm  lowering my price from the initial $18,000 to $16,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I emphasize that the offer is ""fair"" for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By staying above my minimum, I keep the option open to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, providing a guaranteed sale.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I continue negotiating with Bob, I risk ending up with a price lower than my minimum or losing time with limited rounds left.

**Conclusion:**  By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoid further potential losses in negotiations with Bob."
