"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings compared to its true value. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
