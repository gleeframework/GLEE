Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still hoping for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is within your budget and a decent deal.  It's likely that if you reject this offer and make another counteroffer, Alice will simply stick to $11,000.  So, it's better to accept the offer and buy the product."
