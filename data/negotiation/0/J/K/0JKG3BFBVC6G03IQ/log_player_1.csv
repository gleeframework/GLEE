"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to try to get a better offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This offers a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,250 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk further haggling and potentially losing a deal that's already close to my minimum value. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is more than acceptable."
