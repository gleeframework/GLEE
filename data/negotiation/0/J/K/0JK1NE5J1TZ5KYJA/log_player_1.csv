I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value."

While I'm happy with $15,000, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.  Hopefully, this will be enough to secure a deal without risking losing him entirely."
