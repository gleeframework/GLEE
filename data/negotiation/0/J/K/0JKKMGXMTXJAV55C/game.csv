"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good, my budget is a bit tighter. Could we settle around $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $760,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Let's make this our final price –  $790,000, and we have a deal.  This is a fantastic price for a product you won't find anywhere else.",790000.0,Alice,5,
