"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $825,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good, my budget is a bit tighter. Could we settle around $760,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price.  While $760,000 is below my initial target, I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal than selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $760,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  Let's make this our final price –  $790,000, and we have a deal.  This is a fantastic price for a product you won't find anywhere else."",
""product_price"": 790000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm putting a firm offer on the table now.  It's a strong compromise:  
* It's above my fallback price of selling to John. 
* It's significantly below Bob's perceived value, meaning he's still getting a great deal.
* The ""final offer"" language adds pressure for him to accept."
