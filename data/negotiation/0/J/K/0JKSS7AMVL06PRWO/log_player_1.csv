{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $120 but below your minimum of $150, giving room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to compromise, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my preferred price, it's closer to my minimum than John's offer.  Negotiations are often about compromise, and this offer seems like a good place to land."
