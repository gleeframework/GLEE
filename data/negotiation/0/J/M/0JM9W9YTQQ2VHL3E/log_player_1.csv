Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start negotiations a little higher than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $115 is close to Bob's perceived value of $120, making it more likely he'll consider it seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies there's room for discussion (""What do you think?""), opening the door for Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to your minimum acceptable price ($100) than it is to his own perceived value ($120). There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for a potential counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate by moving closer to his price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $110 is still a good profit margin for you, and it's a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Simple and Clear:**  A straightforward counteroffer makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, $107.50 is still a reasonable profit above your minimum ($100).  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains, and there's a risk of Bob losing interest or you misjudging his willingness to pay.  It's better to secure a solid profit now."
