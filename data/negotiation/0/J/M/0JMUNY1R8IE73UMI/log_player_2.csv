"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Starting at $80 gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your maximum and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $95, we're splitting the difference between her current offer ($110) and our previous offer ($80). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Framing as ""Fair"":**  Using the word ""fair"" implies this is a reasonable and justifiable price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  We're still below John's $100 offer, giving us a fallback option if Alice completely refuses to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $105, but I think it's a bit of a stretch for me to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has explicitly stated this is her lowest price. 
* **John's offer is better:**  John's price of $100 is now more favorable than Alice's $105.
* **Time cost of negotiation:**  Further back-and-forth might only yield a small discount, if any, and it's not worth the extra effort."
