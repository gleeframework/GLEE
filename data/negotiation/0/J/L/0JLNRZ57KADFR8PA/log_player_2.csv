**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $10,000.
* Alice's offer is $9,500.
* You can get the product from John for $10,000.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value for the product.  It's best to reject her offer and buy from John since you're only losing $500 compared to your maximum value."
