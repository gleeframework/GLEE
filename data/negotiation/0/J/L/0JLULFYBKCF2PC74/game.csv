"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,250?  This price is still fair for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
