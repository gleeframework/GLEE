Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave some room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay it, and if not, we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115?  This is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will lead to a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $111?  That way we both get a little closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

I'm offering $111, which is a compromise that's halfway between our last two offers.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, and hopefully, it'll be enough to convince him."
