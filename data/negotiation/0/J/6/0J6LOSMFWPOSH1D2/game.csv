"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $1000000 for this product.  I'd like to propose a price of $1050000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $800000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
