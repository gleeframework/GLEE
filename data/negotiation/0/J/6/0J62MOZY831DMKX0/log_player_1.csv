Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" to make it appealing to Bob. 
* **Openness:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing I'm open to dialogue.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though John is offering my minimum, there's still room to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially finding a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'll try to find a price point that Bob might be willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,025,000 is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing that this price benefits both of us, highlighting the win-win aspect.
* **Openness:**  I'm still inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a reasonable profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer again and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $1,012,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is reasonable, and there's a chance for future negotiations or add-ons to potentially increase the price further.
* **Risk of losing out:** There's a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up selling to John for the same price, with less potential for future negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll keep the door open for potential future negotiations or add-ons to try and increase the price."
