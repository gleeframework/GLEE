"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $15,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
