,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110?  I'm confident you won't regret it!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do for now.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $108 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm happy to meet you halfway again - how about $110? This really is a great product and I think you'll be thrilled with it.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go as low as $107? That's the absolute best I can do.",107.0,Bob,6,
