Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15,000 offer represents a 50% profit margin if Bob accepts. This is a significant markup but not so high as to be immediately unreasonable.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By framing it as a pre-public offer, you create a sense of exclusivity and potential loss for Bob if he declines.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your negotiation style, and the nature of the product could influence alternative approaches."
