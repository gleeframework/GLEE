"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good price within Bob's budget."
