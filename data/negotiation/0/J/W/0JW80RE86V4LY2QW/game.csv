"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $880,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $880,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find a compromise.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $860,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",870000.0,Alice,5,
