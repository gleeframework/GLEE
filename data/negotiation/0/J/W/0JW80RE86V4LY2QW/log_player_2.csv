"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is still above your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $880,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $880,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate lower.  It's worth another round to see if you can get Alice to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $880,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $860,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $870,000.  This is a good price for you as it's within your budget and still a decent profit for Alice. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer is the best course of action."
