"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Alice's offer is still higher than her value for the product ($1,000,000), it's lower than the price Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000).
* **Saving money is the goal:** Bob's objective is to save money. Accepting Alice's offer saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
