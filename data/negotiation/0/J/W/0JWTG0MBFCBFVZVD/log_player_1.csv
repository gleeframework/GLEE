"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $130. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm offering a slight discount to try and close the deal.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
