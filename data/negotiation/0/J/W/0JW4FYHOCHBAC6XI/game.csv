"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
