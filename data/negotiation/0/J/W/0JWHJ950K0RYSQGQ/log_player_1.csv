"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he values the product. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer and see where things go from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $18,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also believe the product has significant value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I have a few rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000, which is only $1,000 more than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price. I have only a few rounds left, and I can't risk him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially lowering his offer further. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure I secure a sale and avoid losing out on potential gains."
