"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above Bob's budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to compromise. He's aiming to get a price closer to his own budget, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the first offer, $18,000 is still outside of his budget and he has a guaranteed deal with John for less.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he should try to push her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to get the best deal possible.  He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing that he's serious about buying the product, but still keeping it below his limit. This counteroffer creates a strong position for the next round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While getting close to his limit,  $16,000 is still above his budget. He has a guaranteed deal with John for less, and with only 5 rounds remaining, there's still a chance he can get Alice to go lower. It's worth a final push to try and close the deal with Alice at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob is making his final push in this round. This is his absolute limit, and it matches what he can buy the product for from John. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will move to John to ensure he gets the product."
