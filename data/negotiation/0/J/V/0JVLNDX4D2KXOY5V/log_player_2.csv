**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's worth ($12,000) but significantly lower than the initial offer.
* This shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to come down. 
* The counteroffer is within the acceptable range for me ($15,000 limit) and gives room for further negotiations."
