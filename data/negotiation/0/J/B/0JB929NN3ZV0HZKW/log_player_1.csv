Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate if he wants to. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This shows you're confident in your product's value and leaves space for negotiation without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $120 and leaves less room for profit.  It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a great deal for a product you value at $150! Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.
* **Maintaining a profit:** $110 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob places on the product and highlights the potential for a win-win scenario."
