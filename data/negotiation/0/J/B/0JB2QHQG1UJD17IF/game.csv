"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has tremendous potential. I value it at significantly more than $1200000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1500000.  Consider this your chance to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
