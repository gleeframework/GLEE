"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly more than my budget. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is a fair price given my budget and the product's market value. I'm eager to work with you, but this is my maximum offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $850,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still providing significant value for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the potential value I see in this product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While I appreciate your latest offer, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
