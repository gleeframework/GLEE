"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $82.50. Can you consider going down to $80? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $82.50 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $81.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",81.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $80. Can you consider going down to $81? That's the closest I can get to my target price.",81.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $81, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you a price of $81.25. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",81.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $81.25 and $80, which would be $80.625. Can you consider this price?",80.625,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way up to $80.62, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $81.25 and $80.62, which would be $80.93. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",80.93,Alice,9,
