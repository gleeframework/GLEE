Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than his valuation to make it attractive.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, acting as our safety net.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $130 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also provides a significant profit margin compared to John's offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price appealing to Bob and maximizing potential profit for Alice."
