Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is $1,350,000.  This is a good deal, as it's $150,000 less than what you would pay to John.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and you risk losing the product to another buyer.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
