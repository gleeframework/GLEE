# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts!

Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price.  He can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down a bit more.  Additionally,  John's offer is only slightly higher, and Bob can always go with that option if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice."
