"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm definitely interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000.  However, I'm still just a little over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
