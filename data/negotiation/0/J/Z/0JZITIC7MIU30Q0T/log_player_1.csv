Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, trying to sell to Bob first offers a chance to earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $125 is a compromise. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a potential saving compared to me selling it to John. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights potential value for Bob without revealing desperation or detailed information that could hinder negotiation.

**It's a gamble, but if Bob values the product even slightly more than $125 or dislikes the hassle of finding an alternative, he might accept.**"
