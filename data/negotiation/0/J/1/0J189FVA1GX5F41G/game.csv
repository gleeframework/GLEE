"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that 200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do 175, which is still a great value for this product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. While I appreciate the offer, 175 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at 150? It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make another compromise. I can do 160, which is still a great value for this product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for this product.",150.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can do 155, which is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate. While 155 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. Let's split the difference - $152.50.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 152.50 and my previous offer of 155. How about 153.75? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",153.75,Alice,9,
