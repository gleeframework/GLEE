"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit.  I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,350,000 is still too far from what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm offering you the product for $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price again. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.
