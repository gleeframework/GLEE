{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value it offers and gives you room for a profitable return. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit given the product's value to your business. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not yet willing to accept it. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget.  However, $850,000 still doesn't reflect the value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to go down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our interests and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. If you're not willing to meet me at $850,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of not finding a better deal is too high. I'll accept John's offer to sell for $800,000."
