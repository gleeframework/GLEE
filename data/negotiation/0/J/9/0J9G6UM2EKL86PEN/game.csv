"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value it offers and gives you room for a profitable return. Let's discuss!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit given the product's value to your business. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget.  However, $850,000 still doesn't reflect the value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to go down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes both our interests and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. If you're not willing to meet me at $850,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
