"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product has the potential to bring you even greater returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects its true worth and allows us both to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,050,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
