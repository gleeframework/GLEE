Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I can still fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is still above Bob's initial offer but lower than my previous offer. It shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value."
