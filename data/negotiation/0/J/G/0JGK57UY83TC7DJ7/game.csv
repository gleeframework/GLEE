"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand this is a significant investment for you, but I believe the value this product brings to your business far exceeds the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
