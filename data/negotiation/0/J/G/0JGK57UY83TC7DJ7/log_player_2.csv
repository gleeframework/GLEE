Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I understand this is a significant investment for you, but I believe the value this product brings to your business far exceeds the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice is still far above your maximum budget. She's shown a willingness to negotiate but at this pace, it's unlikely you'll reach a price that works for you before the rounds run out. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for you."
