"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
