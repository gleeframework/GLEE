Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Negotiation Room:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to anchor his perception of the product's value. This leaves room for negotiation but risks Bob walking away.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Knowing Bob's valuation, you can bypass negotiation and sell directly to John for your guaranteed price.

**Offer (Option 1 - Negotiation)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding terms that work for us both."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 price tag sets a high starting point.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message signals your willingness to negotiate, potentially enticing Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or easily walks away, this approach might backfire.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing Bob to try for a higher price?

**Offer (Option 2 - Direct Sale)**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, and you know Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, it makes more sense to go directly to John. You can inform Bob the product has already been sold."
