Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to a fair value for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  However, $950,000 is still not in the range I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product for you.
