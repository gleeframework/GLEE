Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming slightly below that ($1,150,000) maximizes your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John. This knowledge gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Factors like your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiation style could influence your offer."
