"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm initially offering it for $950,000.  Given its value, I believe this is a very fair starting point for our discussion.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the value, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
