"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm initially offering it for $950,000.  Given its value, I believe this is a very fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$950,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to my limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.
