Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the value, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has given his ""final offer"" and it's clear he's not willing to go any higher. While $875,000 is a good chunk of money, I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to sell to John at this point and secure the maximum value for the product."
