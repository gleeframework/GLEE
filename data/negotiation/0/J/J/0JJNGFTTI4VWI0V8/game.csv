"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I value the product at. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
