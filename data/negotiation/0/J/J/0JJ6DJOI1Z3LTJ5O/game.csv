"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it has significant value, but I'm capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident this product has significant value for me, but I can't go beyond $850,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975,000. This price is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
