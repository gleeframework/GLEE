"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I value your interest and am willing to come down a bit more. How about $16,000?  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $14,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,6,
