"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. However, there's still room for negotiation.

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is moving closer to my baseline. While selling to John is an option, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I value your interest and am willing to come down a bit more. How about $16,000?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $14,000? I think that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one! Bob is getting very close to my minimum, but I also don't want to lose the sure sale to John. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, it's getting risky. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price, and avoids the potential of Bob walking away in a later round."
