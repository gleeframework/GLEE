"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. While there's a chance you could negotiate further with Alice and get a slightly lower price, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially ending up paying more to John isn't worth it for a small potential saving."
