"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price of $18,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500?  It's still a good deal for you and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 16500}
