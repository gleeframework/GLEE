"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** means you pay $9,000, which is less than what you'd pay John ($10,000). 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** forces you to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
