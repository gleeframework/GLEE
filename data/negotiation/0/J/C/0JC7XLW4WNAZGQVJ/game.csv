"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $8,000? That seems like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can offer you a free consultation and a one-year warranty, which is worth $1,000. So, the total price would be $8,500 + $1,000 = $9,500. It's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product with added value. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
