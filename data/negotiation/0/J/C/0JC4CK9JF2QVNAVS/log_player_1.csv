I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum value of $120.  I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $120. I'll counter his offer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $130. This is a compromise, but I'm still getting closer to my minimum value.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is insistent on a price that's too low for me.  I'm not willing to keep going back and forth, and I know I can get $120 from John. I'll take the guaranteed sale and move on."
