"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This will test his willingness to pay and potentially trigger a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm not willing to sell at that price yet, but I want to see if I can push him higher.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility but staying above Bob's counteroffer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the deal within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum threshold. I could continue negotiating, but there's a risk of reaching an impasse, and I don't want to waste more time.  Selling to John now guarantees me the minimum price, and I can avoid further negotiation with Bob."
