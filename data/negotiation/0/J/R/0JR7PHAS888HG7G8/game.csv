"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the value of this product and its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the worth of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
