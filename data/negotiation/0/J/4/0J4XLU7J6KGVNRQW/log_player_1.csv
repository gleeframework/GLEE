Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident that John's offer of $80 provides a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm countering with $85. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's a good outcome, considering my safety net with John."
