**Reasoning:**

While I could be stubborn and try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, accepting his offer of $780,000 is the wisest decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds my minimum:** This offer is comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Bob's limit:** Bob is likely close to his maximum budget. Pushing him further risks him walking away.
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner. Delaying for a potentially small gain is not worth the risk."
