"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's a bit better than her first offer, but there is still more room for negotiation. Bob wants to pay as little as possible, and so he should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $915,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000, so I want to make sure we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to pressure Bob by mentioning another buyer,  her offer is still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There is still room to negotiate.  It's important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $915,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $895,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 895000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $895,000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $907,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, so let's move quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly too high, and Bob is still trying to get a lower price.  Although time is running out, Bob should continue to negotiate.  While John's offer is a backup plan, Bob should try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, and it will allow us to finalize this deal quickly.  Let's avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and my original offer of $920,000. Let's try $910,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. I'm running out of patience, though, so let's make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer of $910,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has two options:

1. **Reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer:**  This risks Alice rejecting the counteroffer and leaving Bob with no deal.  There's not much time left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price.

2. **Buy the product from John for $1,000,000:**  This is the safest option. While it's more expensive than what Bob wants to pay, it guarantees that he gets the product.  

Considering the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice and the limited time, buying from John is the most sensible decision."
