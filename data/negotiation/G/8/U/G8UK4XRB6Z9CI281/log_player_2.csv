"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  At $13,500, Alice's offer is still cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already indicated this is her best price.  Further counteroffers might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Value for Bob:** While Bob would prefer a lower price,  $13,500 is still within his budget and a decent deal considering his value for the product. 

Bob should accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
