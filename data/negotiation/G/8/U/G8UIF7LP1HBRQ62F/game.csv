"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong first offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,100,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is the best I can do without compromising my own valuation of the product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
