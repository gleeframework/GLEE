Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is sticking close to his $1,000,000 mark and his increases are getting smaller.  It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position. While I could push for more, the difference is becoming less significant compared to the risk of losing him as a buyer.
