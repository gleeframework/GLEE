Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate but still leaving me a healthy profit. I want to see if he's willing to pay a high price upfront, as this will save time and effort on my part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's more appealing to Bob than his initial offer.  I'm aiming to find a price that we can both agree on, without going through too many rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with that value. I don't want to continue negotiating with Bob, and  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,200,000.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
