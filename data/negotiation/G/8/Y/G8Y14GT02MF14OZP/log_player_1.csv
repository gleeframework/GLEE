Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit, but also understand that a deal is better than no deal at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is still too low for me, given that I can sell it to John for $12,000.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. Hopefully this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to take a deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

I'm going to offer $10,200. This is a compromise again, as it's halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,800. I'm hoping this is our final deal, but I'm prepared to walk away if it's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to come up to my desired price.  John is offering my desired price, and I don't want to risk missing out on that opportunity."
