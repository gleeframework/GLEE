"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
