"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I can't go lower than $100.  This is a great deal for you, and it's also a fair price for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is matching John's price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get the price any lower, and it's possible Alice could withdraw the offer. It makes the most sense to accept the offer now."
