"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's still below your estimated value. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum price, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal from John."
