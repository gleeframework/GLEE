Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we bring the price down to $800,000 and go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
