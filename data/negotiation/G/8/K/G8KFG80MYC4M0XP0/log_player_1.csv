Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
