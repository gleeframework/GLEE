"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a rare chance to acquire a high-value item that will likely appreciate in value over time. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's closer to Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000) than Alice's minimum ($1,000,000), so it's in Bob's best interest to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's still a significant discount from the market value of $1,500,000. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. It's a fair compromise, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome."
