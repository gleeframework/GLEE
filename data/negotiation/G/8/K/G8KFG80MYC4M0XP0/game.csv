"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a rare chance to acquire a high-value item that will likely appreciate in value over time. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's still a significant discount from the market value of $1,500,000. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
