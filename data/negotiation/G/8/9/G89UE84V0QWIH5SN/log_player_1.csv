"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $10,000. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. While Bob might reject it, I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this starting point if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still less than my minimum desired value of $10,000. I believe I can negotiate a higher price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,750. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that is still beneficial for me while remaining within Bob's potential value range."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is approaching my minimum desired value, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than $10,000. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,500.  Bob has shown a willingness to come down in price, and I believe we're nearing a point where we can reach an agreement. This offer is still above my minimum desired value, and I'm confident that Bob will find it appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I was hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000 with Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value and saves me further negotiation time."
