"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting gives Bob the chance to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
