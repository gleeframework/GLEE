Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. It's a fair deal and there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
