"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a great opportunity for us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, making it the better financial decision."
