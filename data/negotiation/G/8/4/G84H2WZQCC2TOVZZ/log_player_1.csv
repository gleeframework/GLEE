"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds.  If he rejects, I'll see if his counteroffer is worthwhile.  If not, I'll be prepared to move on to John if necessary."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still too low. I want to see if I can push him higher.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still hold firm on a profit. This offer is closer to Bob's but gives me a substantial profit. Let's see if he takes the bait."

I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but I think I can squeeze a little more out of him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a small compromise from my last offer, showing Bob I'm serious about a deal, but still ensuring I get a good profit. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is stagnant at $1,200,000.  I'm not going to settle for that yet.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time in hopes of getting a little closer to my target. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer to Bob at $1,275,000. It's a small compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still  gives me a decent profit. If he rejects this, I'll go ahead and sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is not yielding a profitable enough outcome.  I've made numerous concessions and  Bob's offers are not coming close enough to my target.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and secure the deal."
