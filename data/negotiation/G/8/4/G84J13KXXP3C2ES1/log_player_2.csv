"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and her product's value to you. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Polite & Direct:**  Being polite keeps the communication positive. Directly stating your price range avoids ambiguity.
* **Justification:**  While not always necessary, hinting at a budget limitation provides some context for your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down in price, $130 is still significantly above your $100 budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be a compromise to be reached.

It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting a price above your budget or going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the value, Alice, but $130 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering $105 positions you as trying to find a middle ground. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a final compromise closer to $100.
* **Setting a Limit:** Clearly stating $105 as your maximum price sets a boundary. This lets Alice know you're serious and may encourage her to make a more substantial move.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** Continuing a respectful tone helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic, increasing the chances of a mutually agreeable outcome."
