"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  While it's better than the initial offer, you're still closer to your budget with John's offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm ready to increase my offer to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your increased offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice and see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still $250,000 higher than what you're willing to pay from John. You only have 3 rounds left, and there's a chance you can still negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $975,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're down to the final round. Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay, and there's no guarantee she will accept a counteroffer. You're better off buying from John for $800,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
