Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal and value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for my full desired value yet, leaving space for negotiation and a potential compromise. 

I'm willing to go lower, but I'll be watching for signs that Bob is serious about buying.  If he seems hesitant or low-balls me too much, I'll move on to John."
