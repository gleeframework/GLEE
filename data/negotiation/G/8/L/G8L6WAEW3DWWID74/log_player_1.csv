**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can still get a better price. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm aiming for a higher profit if possible."

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm still aiming for a higher profit if possible.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also running out of time to reach a deal with him that meets my financial goals.  While I prefer to make more than $1,500,000, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing the deal altogether. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
