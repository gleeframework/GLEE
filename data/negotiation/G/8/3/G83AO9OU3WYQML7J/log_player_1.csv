"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential,"" hinting at a higher value without explicitly stating it. This provides a basis for the high initial price.
* **Flexibility:** I am prepared to negotiate down, but I'm starting high to aim for the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. Let's aim for $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round with a price closer to my target, but still leaving space for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too far from what I had in mind.  This product offers significant potential for return on investment.  How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Strategically):**  While I said ""halfway,"" I'm strategically positioning the price closer to my minimum than Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving but emphasizes the product's value.
* **Highlighting ROI:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential to generate a return on investment, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, as I don't want to appear inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about considering $1,500,000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. It's a good deal, and I'm securing my desired profit. Accepting now avoids the potential risk of him lowering his offer or me missing out on a sale altogether."
