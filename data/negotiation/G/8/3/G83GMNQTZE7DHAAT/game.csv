"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1350000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Can we agree on this price?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1350000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've done my research and I think it's not worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we agree on this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
