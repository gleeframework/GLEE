Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price can still yield a good profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob, other offers could be considered."
