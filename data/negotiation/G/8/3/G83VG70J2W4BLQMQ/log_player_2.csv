Alice's offer:

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. It's a price that would save me a decent amount compared to both Alice's initial offer and buying from John."
