"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's close to my bottom line. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Alice has indicated her price is close to her bottom line, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13500}
