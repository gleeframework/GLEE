**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $985,000 offer.  While continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, the difference is not worth risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
