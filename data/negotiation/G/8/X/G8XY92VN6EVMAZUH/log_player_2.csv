"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000? This would give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $6,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would be a good deal for me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John at this point."
