"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $3,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  By starting high, you establish a baseline for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.  You have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $12,000 is my final offer.  This price still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $11,250 is only $1,250 below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for future deals:**  While it's not ideal, accepting this offer keeps the possibility of future deals with Bob open. He might be more willing to pay a higher price in the future if you establish a positive relationship.
* **Time pressure:** You've already gone through four rounds and have only six left. Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but it's a lost opportunity to potentially make more.

This offer allows you to secure a decent profit while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
