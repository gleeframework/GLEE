"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay top dollar. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I could come down to $900,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the value you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
