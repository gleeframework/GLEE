"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  To start the negotiation, I'm offering it at $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always advantageous to start with an ambitious offer in negotiations. This leaves room for concessions and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Gauging the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his valuation of the product. His response will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** The safety net of John's offer at $800,000 allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below both my minimum ($800,000) and his own stated value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount, especially when I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about obtaining a fair price closer to the product's true worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial concession of $75,000.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer of $925,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer and keeps me well within a profitable range. 
* **Pressure and Incentive:** This counteroffer puts a degree of pressure on Bob to respond with a more reasonable offer while still providing him with a significant discount if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $925,000, so I'm offering $812,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $812,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee of success. Bob has shown he is willing to move, but he may be reaching his upper limit. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling completely, leaving me with John's lower offer."
