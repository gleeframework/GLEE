"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the significant value it offers and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  While I appreciate the value, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
