"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget, and there's no need to rush into a deal.  He should see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  He's still got plenty of rounds left to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm at $13,000.  I'm really hoping we can find a deal here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten her down to $13,500, which is within his budget.  He could try to push for a lower price, but he's already gone through several rounds, and there's a risk she'll walk away.  It's a good deal for both of them."
