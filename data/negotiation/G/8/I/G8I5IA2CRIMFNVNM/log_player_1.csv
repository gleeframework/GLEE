Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially leading to an even higher sale price.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's value increases the likelihood of him accepting, avoiding the need to sell to John for $100."
