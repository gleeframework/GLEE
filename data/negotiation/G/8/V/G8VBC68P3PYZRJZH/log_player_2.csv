(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While this is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
This offer is Bob's maximum price. He's willing to pay this amount, but he's not going to go higher. If Alice rejects, he'll buy from John."
