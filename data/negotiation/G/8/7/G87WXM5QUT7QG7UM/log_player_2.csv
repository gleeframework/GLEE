# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $90 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price of $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price closer to Alice's value of $80 while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a little further down before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $78? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

We are getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80). This offer aims to achieve a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to give you a small discount, and I'll offer the product for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It seems we've reached a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful.  $82 is a reasonable price, saving us $18 compared to John's offer.  Let's accept and secure the deal!"
