"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $7,500? That's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $8,200 is still a bit high for me. My final offer is $7,800. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $7,800, which would be $8,000. However, I also want to remind you that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $8,000, so I need to consider that as well.",8000.0,Alice,7,
