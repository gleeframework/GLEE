"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond quickly to secure this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is already a great deal as it falls well below your $10,000 maximum and allows you to save $500 compared to John's offer.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, and it's not worth risking losing this deal for a potentially small gain."
