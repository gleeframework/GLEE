Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $90. How about we try $105? It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it.",100.0,Alice,5,
