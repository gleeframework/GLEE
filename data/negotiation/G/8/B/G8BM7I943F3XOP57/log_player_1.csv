Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) increases the chances of securing a higher final price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially appealing considering the product's value to him."
