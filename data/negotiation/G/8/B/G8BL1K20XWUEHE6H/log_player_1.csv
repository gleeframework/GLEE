Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair value given its worth to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to close the deal, $800,000 is far too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is simply too low.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
