"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm. Would you consider $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that's reasonable for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $820,000. This is my final offer for this round.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer for this round, but I'm still a bit away from that number.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $790,000? This shows I'm willing to move closer to your price.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $790,000 is still a bit short of my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $815,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the sale at this price.",815000.0,Alice,7,
