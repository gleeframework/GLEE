Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It also highlights the value of the product to him, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $110. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can counter-offer for something closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer!  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down again. $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $115? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is close to my desired price and still above my minimum of $100. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures a good sale and avoids the risk of rejection or a lower offer from John."
