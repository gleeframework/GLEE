"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's potential to get it for even less.  It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount. He's hoping to get a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  Offering $800,000 is a strong starting point, but still leaves space for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away the farm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer, but Bob is still aiming for a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if he can get closer to his desired price. He's not desperate enough to buy from John yet, as there's still potential to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increasing his offer from the previous round, showing that he's willing to negotiate, but still pushing for a lower price.  $850,000 is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still not at the point where he's willing to accept.  There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, and  Bob doesn't want to settle unless he absolutely has to. He's also aware that buying from John is still an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point, but he's still trying to get a good deal. He's raising his offer to $900,000, which is just slightly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is not willing to give in entirely.  He's hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is inching closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still not willing to settle just yet. He's already shown his willingness to compromise, and the counteroffer rounds have been getting progressively closer.  Bob is hoping that Alice will budge a bit more in the next round, and he's not yet at the point where buying from John is more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push.  He's raising his offer to $950,000, which is just $100,000 less than Alice's current offer. He's demonstrating his commitment to closing the deal, but he's also not willing to overpay. If Alice doesn't accept this counteroffer, he'll likely move on to John, as the potential savings are getting smaller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a crossroads. Alice's offer is getting closer to his limit, but he's also getting low on negotiating power.  While he could counteroffer one more time, the potential savings are minimal, and he's risking the deal falling apart completely. It's more sensible to buy from John at this point, as it guarantees a purchase and limits further potential losses."
