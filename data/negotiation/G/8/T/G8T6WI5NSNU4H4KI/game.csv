"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something we can work with?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another offer, $900000, which I think is a fair price for this product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to make some concessions, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go up to $1000000. I'm willing to make another offer, $850000, which I think is a fair price for this product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $950000, which is $900000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $900000. I can offer it to you for $975000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get close to the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $975000. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",925000.0,Bob,10,
