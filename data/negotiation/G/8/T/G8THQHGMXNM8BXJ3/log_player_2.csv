"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000**, which is still a good deal for Bob as he is willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* **Further negotiation might be possible**, but there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000** compared to buying from John and is a better outcome than potentially losing the deal."
