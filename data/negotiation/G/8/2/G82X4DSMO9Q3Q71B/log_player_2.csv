**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  While Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still lower than the $15,000 you would pay John.
* **You are willing to pay up to $15,000.**  This means Alice's offer is within your budget and allows you to save money."
