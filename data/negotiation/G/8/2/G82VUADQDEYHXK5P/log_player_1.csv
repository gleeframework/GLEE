"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have a backup offer with John, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still holding onto a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential lower offer in future rounds."
