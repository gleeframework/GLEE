Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some incentive to buy.
* **Lower than my minimum value:**  This ensures I make a profit.
* **Close to my fallback option:** This leaves less room for negotiation if Bob rejects.

By offering this price, I'm maximizing my chances of selling the product to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I can always sell it to John for $15,000."
