"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of getting a good price.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly and open message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not aiming for a quick close in the first round. I want to see if Bob is interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is great but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's rejection shows he's willing to negotiate, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps me in control and allows me to make a counteroffer that reflects my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from the previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  Emphasizing that $9,000 is a ""fair price"" for both of us can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept. 
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While I'm making a concession, I'm not giving in completely. This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. Continuing the negotiation gives me more chances to get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob seems committed to buying, and I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  $8,750 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, big impact:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($250) to show I'm serious about a deal. This keeps the pressure on Bob while still moving closer to his offer.
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasizing that $9,250 is a ""significant compromise"" reinforces my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired value.
* **Reinforcing fairness:**  Again, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness helps increase his chance of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to go up to $8,900, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is my final offer, let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  I'm still within striking distance of my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob seems serious about buying, and I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer. I need to push for a more favorable price. 
* **John is an option:** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000.  This gives me leverage to hold out for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,900 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, big impact:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100) to show I'm serious about a deal, but also keeping the pressure on Bob to come up. 
* **Highlighting compromise:** Emphasizing that $9,100 is a ""significant compromise"" reinforces my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired value.
* **Time is ticking:**  With only 3 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my goal, but I need to make a move that gets Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John is still an option:**  I need to push Bob a bit more, but I still have the option of selling to John, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
