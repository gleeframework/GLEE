"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for $8,000, and Alice's offer is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is great but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum price point of $8,000. Keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  $8,750 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, it's still above your target. You have a solid alternative with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price you're not comfortable with. Continue negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to go up to $8,900, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is my final offer, let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,900 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better deal are slim. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the best possible price within your budget."
