"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000, and you have room to negotiate.
* **There's no immediate urgency to buy.** You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a backup. 

By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** $700,000 is well below your maximum budget, giving you a significant saving.
* **First move:** This counteroffer sets the tone for the negotiation, showing Alice that you're serious about a lower price.

**Important Note:** This is a risky move. Alice might reject this counteroffer, and you'll have to adapt in subsequent rounds. However, it's a strategy to potentially secure the product at a much lower price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are still rounds left. You have time to continue negotiating and try to get a better price.
* **John is a backup:**  Remember, you can always buy from John if you can't reach a suitable agreement with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you keep the door open for further negotiation and potentially securing the product at a price that aligns with your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's last one. It shows a willingness to compromise without conceding too much.
* **Testing the waters:** By increasing your offer slightly, you gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate closer to your desired price. 
* **Still below budget:** This offer is comfortably within your maximum budget, leaving room for further adjustments.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially push Alice closer to a price that is beneficial for both of you."

* **More negotiation rounds remain.**  You have 5 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price.  
* **John is still an option:**  You can still buy the product from John at a fixed price if you can't reach a deal with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you maintain your negotiating stance and try to get a lower price in the following rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is close to Alice's last offer but still below your maximum budget. It signals that you're willing to pay a reasonable price.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  With only a few rounds left, it's time to put some pressure on Alice.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer, it's worth the gamble to see if you can secure a better deal.

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise and hopefully close the deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight decrease from her previous offer, it's still above your maximum budget and leaves you with very little room for savings.
* **Time is running out:** You only have 3 rounds left to negotiate a better price.
* **John is a viable alternative:** If you don't reach a deal with Alice, you can still purchase the product from John at a fixed price.

While it's tempting to accept Alice's offer to secure the product, the price is still too high.  You need to try one last counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is your final counteroffer, and it's a significant increase from your last one. It demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price.
* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is right in the middle of your last offer and Alice's last offer, showing that you're willing to split the difference.
* **High stakes:** With only two rounds left, this offer is a gamble. Alice may reject it, and you'll have to make a tough decision in the final round.

This final counteroffer is a calculated risk. If Alice accepts, you'll secure a good price. If she rejects it, you'll have to decide whether to accept her final offer or purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  You have only one round remaining. This means you're at the end of the negotiation with Alice.
* **Slight decrease:** While Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, it's a small decrease from her previous offer.
* **John's price:**  John's price of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Alice's current offer. 

Taking Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a slightly higher price than desired but still saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of rejecting the offer and potentially ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential for a lower price in the final round."
