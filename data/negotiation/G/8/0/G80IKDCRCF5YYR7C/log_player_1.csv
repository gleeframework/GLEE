Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still getting more than $1,000,000, your floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer and still get a better price than he would from John.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still $50,000 lower than your initial proposal. You have room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your desired $1,150,000.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss of potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,075,000? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,075,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and ending up with John's offer outweighs the potential gain.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
