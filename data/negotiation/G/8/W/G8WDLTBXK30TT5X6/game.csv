"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  However, I need a price that reflects its value.  Let's try $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
