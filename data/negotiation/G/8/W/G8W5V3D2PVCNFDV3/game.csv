"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115? Let's see if we can find some common ground.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $118.  Let's try to close this deal.",118.0,Bob,4,
