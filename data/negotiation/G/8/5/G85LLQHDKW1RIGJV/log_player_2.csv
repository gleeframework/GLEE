"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's clear you need to negotiate.  Buying from John right now would be the easiest option, but you can likely get a better deal from Alice with some bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not feasible.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This provides room for bargaining.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $600,000, you are setting a low anchor point, which might influence Alice to consider lower counteroffers. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer will help you gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice lowered her price, $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from $1,800,000 to $1,400,000 suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **Leverage:** You still have the option to walk away and buy from John, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm able to spend.  To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $700,000.  If you can get closer to that range, I'm confident we can strike a deal."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  You're raising your offer, but staying well below your $800,000 maximum. This shows movement on your end while still leaving space for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other options, you're subtly reminding Alice of your ability to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Urgency:**  Phrasing like ""confident we can strike a deal"" implies that a deal is possible but only if Alice makes a significant concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I recognize the importance of finding a solution. I'm prepared to make a significant move and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a substantial concession and reflects my strong interest in closing a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,100,000 is still a significant amount over your $800,000 limit.
* **Maintain Leverage:** You still have leverage as Alice seems eager to close the deal. Continuing to negotiate might bring the price down further.
* **Time Consideration:**  You're over halfway through the rounds. While you don't want to drag it out too long, you're in a good position to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I respect your willingness to negotiate, and $1,100,000 is getting closer.  However,  to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value I'm getting.  Let me know if you're open to that figure."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You're now presenting your maximum price. This is a strong signal to Alice that you're serious and won't go higher. 
* **Justification:** You're reminding Alice of the value she gains by closing the deal, subtly shifting focus away from just the price.
* **Directness:**  By explicitly stating your desired price and asking if she's ""open to it,"" you're pushing for a clear yes or no response. 

**Important Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll need to decide if you want to continue negotiating (and potentially risk losing the deal) or walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
