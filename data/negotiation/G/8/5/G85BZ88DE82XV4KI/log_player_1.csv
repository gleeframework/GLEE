"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and has a high budget. It's a bold opening move that could either get us close to my desired price quickly, or give me some information about Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'd accept, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, so I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer by $250,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price and I'm getting closer to closing the deal. While I'd love to get more, I'm also concerned about the risk of losing the sale and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a good sale."
