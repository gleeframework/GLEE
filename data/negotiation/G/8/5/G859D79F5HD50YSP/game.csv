"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're motivated to sell, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, and I think that's a fair compromise. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
