"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $20,000 is significantly above your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is a reasonable strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $17,000 is still above your budget, and you are aiming to save as much as possible. 
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile:** You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room for a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is still a good fallback:** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have the option of buying from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 significantly undervalues the product and the benefits it brings.  I'm willing to consider a price of $15,500, which is my final offer. This is a very reasonable compromise considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close, but still too high:** $15,500 is only $500 less than what you could pay John for the same product.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting your counteroffer and wasting valuable rounds.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal:**  By buying from John, you guarantee a price within your budget and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
