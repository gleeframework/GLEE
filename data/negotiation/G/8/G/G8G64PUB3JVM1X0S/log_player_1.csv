Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with an offer slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.  However, I'm also aware that if he rejects this offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and get some money, it's below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer but lower than my original asking price. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get close to my desired value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is slightly lower than my minimum threshold, but it's close enough and I'm confident I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be a slightly lower profit, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
