Bob's offer:

While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $12,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about we try $14,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.
