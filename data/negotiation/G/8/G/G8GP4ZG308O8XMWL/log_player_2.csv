"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I understand your position.  While $850000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $925000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue negotiating to try to reach a price closer to his target of $850,000."
