,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand your position.  While $850000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $925000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900000?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a solid profit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
