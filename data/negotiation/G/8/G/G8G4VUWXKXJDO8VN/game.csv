"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $1,150,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
