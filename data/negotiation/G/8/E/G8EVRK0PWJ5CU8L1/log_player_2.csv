"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,250,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I stay within my budget."
