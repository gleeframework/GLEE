"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value we've both agreed on, and it allows for some profit on your end.  Let's see if we can strike a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
