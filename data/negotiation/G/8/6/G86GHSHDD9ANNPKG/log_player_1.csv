Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High but Reasonable:**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and potential ""benefits"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** This offer gives Bob an incentive to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $1,450,000 and $1,500,000. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my desired price."
