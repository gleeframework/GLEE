I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too low. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also higher than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
