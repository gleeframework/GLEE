``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which can be helpful in building rapport and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is below my minimum,  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
