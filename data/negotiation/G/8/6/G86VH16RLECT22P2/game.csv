"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit high for you, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we possibly make a deal at $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  Let's make this deal happen.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already offered you $11,250, and you're asking me to meet you halfway again. I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $11,500, but that's it. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
