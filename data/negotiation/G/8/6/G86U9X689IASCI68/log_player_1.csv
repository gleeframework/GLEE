Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum price of $12,000, ensuring you're making a profit.

This approach allows for potential negotiation while leaving you the option to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $6,000, it's not worth the risk of losing out on the $12,000 from John. 

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
