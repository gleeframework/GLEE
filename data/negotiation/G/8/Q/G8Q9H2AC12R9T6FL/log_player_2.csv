"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject this initial offer.  It's worth seeing if you can save an additional $1,000."
