Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also anchors the price high in his mind. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly."
