{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its value and is a fair offer for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This price allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob without making me feel pressured to accept immediately.
* **Flexibility:** This price point allows for the potential to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

**Remember:** I can always choose to accept a counteroffer from Bob if it's closer to my desired price.  However, if the negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, but still lower than $1,000,000. This will give Bob an opportunity to compromise while still ensuring I receive a fair price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This reflects a good compromise on my part, and I believe it's still a fair deal for you considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $880,000 bridges the gap between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price still leaves room for further negotiations if Bob is not willing to meet this price.  
* **Fair Value:** While lower than my ideal price, $880,000 still aligns with the product's value, making it a viable option for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess his next offer. If it's close to my desired price point, I may accept it. However, if it's significantly below, I might consider selling to John for $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, and I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference between our previous offers. Can you consider $865,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Threshold:** While Bob's offer of $865,000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm confident I can still get a better price, especially with John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net. 
* **Risk of Settling Too Low:**  If I accept this offer, I'll be leaving a considerable amount of money on the table. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll aim for a price between $880,000 and $900,000, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $865,000 is still a little too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $862,500. This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $862,500 is close, I'm still unwilling to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **John's Offer is a Better Option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get a price that meets my minimum threshold and secures a much better deal for me.

**Final Decision:**  Given the current negotiation situation, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This decision ensures I receive a price that reflects the product's value and avoids potentially settling for a lower price."
