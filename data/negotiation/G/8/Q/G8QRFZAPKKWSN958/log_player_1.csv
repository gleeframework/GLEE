"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both of us, I'm leaving room for negotiation, but still hoping for a significant gain.  This will give me a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is still a good profit, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my target price. With five rounds remaining, there's still potential for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to $1,150,000. This shows Bob I'm committed to finding a deal, but still holding out for a price that aligns with my initial goal. It's a compromise that leaves room for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is a decent profit, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm getting close to John's offer, but I believe I can still get a slightly higher price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum.  We're nearing the end of the negotiations, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I need to be realistic about the possibility of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are down to our last three rounds. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I am not sure if we will reach an agreement in the next two rounds.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a safe and secure option. It guarantees my minimum profit and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
