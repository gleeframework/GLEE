Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify a price higher than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate if he finds it unreasonable. This keeps the door open for a potentially even higher sale price than your backup offer."
