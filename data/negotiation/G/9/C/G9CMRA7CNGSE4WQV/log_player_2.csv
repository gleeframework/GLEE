Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

You're still looking to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still above your target price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best move."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $89. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've managed to negotiate the price down to $89, which is a good deal for you. You are saving $11 compared to buying from John.  It's a good time to accept the offer.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also risks the deal falling apart and you having to buy from John at $100."
