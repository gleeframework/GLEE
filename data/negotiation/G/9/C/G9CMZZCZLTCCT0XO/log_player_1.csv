"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with $115. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $105 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for me to make a profit. Since we're nearing the middle ground, I hope this offer will be acceptable to Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a decent price, I believe I can still get a slightly better offer from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures I can make a profit while also satisfying Bob's desire for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a better price from Bob, we're down to the last few rounds and it's clear Bob is not willing to pay significantly more. It's better to guarantee the $80 sale than risk getting stuck with a lower price in the final rounds."
