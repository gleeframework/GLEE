"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is still a good price for me, considering I'm willing to pay $12,000 from John. There's a good chance I could continue negotiating and maybe get a little lower, but the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it.  Accepting this offer gets me the product for a good price."
