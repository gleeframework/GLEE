Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Language:** The message implies the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:**  While I have a fallback option with John, there's a chance Bob could be scared off by a price significantly higher than his perceived value. This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
