Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also acknowledging your interest. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very keen on the product. 
* **Balance Confidence and Flexibility:** The message aims to convey the product's value while still being open to Bob's response."
