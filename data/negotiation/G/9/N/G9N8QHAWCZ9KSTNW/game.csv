"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can finally close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
