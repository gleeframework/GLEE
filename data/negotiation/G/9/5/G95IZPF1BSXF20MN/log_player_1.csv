Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum goal of $8,000.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it to avoid further negotiation.  It's always good to secure a deal when you're satisfied with the price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative with John."
