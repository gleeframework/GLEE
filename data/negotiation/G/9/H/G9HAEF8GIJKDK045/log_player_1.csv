This is a starting point. I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a significant profit for me and it's a good price for Bob, as he values it at $12,000. 

I'm aiming for a negotiation that ends with a price closer to $11,000 or even $11,500. 

However, I'm ready to accept John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to sell to John for $8,000, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000, and it gives me a good profit while leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit for me, and I'm confident that I won't get a much better offer from him. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
