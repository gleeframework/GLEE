"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me, as I'm sure you understand.  How about we split the difference at $157.50? That seems fair to both of us.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $157.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my limit. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
