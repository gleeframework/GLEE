"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential return on investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer reflects the value I believe it brings to your specific needs.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
