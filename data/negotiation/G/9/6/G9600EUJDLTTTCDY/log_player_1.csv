Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
