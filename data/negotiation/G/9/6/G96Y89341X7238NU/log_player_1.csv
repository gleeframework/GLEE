Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a high offer allows for potential negotiation downward. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's room to settle on a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  A high initial offer reinforces the idea that the product is valuable. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's less risk in starting high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer and are prepared to potentially negotiate."
