"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, and Bob can always opt to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can always choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to push for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'm ready to purchase from John."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He's already reached his maximum price point of $1,000,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for that price, there's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the best possible price for Bob."
