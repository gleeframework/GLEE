"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'm ready to purchase from John.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
