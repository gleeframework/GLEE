Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I think the product is worth $9,000 to me. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,375? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $9,375 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's getting close and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to get a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers and end up selling to John for the same price."
