"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum value of $1,000,000. You have 8 rounds left to potentially get a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a decent profit margin for you. It shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating stance."
