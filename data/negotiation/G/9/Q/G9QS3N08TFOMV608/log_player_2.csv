# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I propose a purchase price of $1,350,000. This amount reflects the product's true worth while providing a fair margin for us. Should you find this offer appealing, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction promptly. If you require any further information or have concerns about the product, I am more than happy to address them. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to her value of $1,200,000. If she won't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
