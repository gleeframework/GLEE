"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10800 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
