"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exceptional value and potential"" provides a rationale for the high initial price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting so high, it's clear that you're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This is just the first round. How Bob responds will heavily influence your next move. 
* You always have John as a backup buyer, which gives you leverage.  You don't want to drag the negotiation on for too long, potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is better than your minimum ($1,500,000), but it's still a significant way off from your initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  See how much he's willing to move from his initial offer. This will give you a better sense of his perceived value and how flexible he's willing to be.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting too quickly could signal that you're willing to go much lower, potentially leaving money on the table.

**Next Steps:** In Round 3, you'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Carefully consider how much you're willing to come down, keeping in mind the $1,500,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 falls short of what I had in mind. To keep this moving, I'm willing to consider $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're coming down from your initial price ($2,200,000), but not drastically. A $300,000 reduction shows you're open to negotiation but still value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:**  By staying relatively close to your original price, you're trying to keep the negotiation anchored closer to your desired outcome.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's worth and potential benefits keeps the focus on its value, not just the price. 

**Key Considerations:** 

* Bob's response will indicate how much further he's willing to go. 
* You have seven rounds remaining, so you still have time to negotiate. However, keep John's offer in mind as a potential alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your minimum threshold of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner allows you to redeploy your time and resources to other opportunities.

While John's offer is slightly higher, the difference of $100,000 might not outweigh the certainty and speed of closing the deal with Bob right now."
