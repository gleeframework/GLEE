"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest, $1,200,000 falls short of what I had in mind. To keep this moving, I'm willing to consider $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and its potential to benefit your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
