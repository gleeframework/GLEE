"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject any lower offer and Bob will have to buy from John at $15,000.  Accepting the $9,000 offer is the best option to save money while still securing the product."
