"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
