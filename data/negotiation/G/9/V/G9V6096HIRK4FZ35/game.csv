"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I know the product's value is higher than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a fair price considering John is offering a similar product for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a smart deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,5,
