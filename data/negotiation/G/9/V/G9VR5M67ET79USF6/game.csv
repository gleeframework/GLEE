"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $15000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
