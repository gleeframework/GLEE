Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and would bring you a lot of value.  I'm initially offering it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering it's a significant discount from your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $7,000 is still considerably below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, my absolute lowest price. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
