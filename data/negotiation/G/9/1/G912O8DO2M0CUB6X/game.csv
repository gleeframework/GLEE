"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and would bring you a lot of value.  I'm initially offering it for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter offer.  While I understand that my initial offer might have seemed high, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $7,000 is still considerably below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, my absolute lowest price. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll be getting.",10000.0,Alice,5,
