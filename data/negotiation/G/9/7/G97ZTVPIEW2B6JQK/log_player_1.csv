"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This is a good starting point because it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I don't have to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm offering $165, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, I still want to push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of finding a middle ground. This offer is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer, and it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $140 is getting close to my minimum, I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating. With only 4 rounds left, I'm feeling the pressure, but I still believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a price of $145. With only a few rounds left, I need to be flexible but still try to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $135. This is only $15 more than what I could get from John, and with only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a reasonable profit."
