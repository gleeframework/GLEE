"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $10,000, a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's ""amazing"" quality emphasizes its potential worth to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $7500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,500 is less than my absolute minimum of $8,000, making it an unacceptable offer at this stage. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob expressed interest in the product and offered a price. This means there's potential for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can  make a counteroffer in the next round that bridges the gap between our positions.  I want to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Find a price point that's closer to my minimum.
*  Signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling to him.
*  Create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $8000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 aligns perfectly with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Upside:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's ""final offer"" and his mention of ""another option"" suggests there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to Bob choosing his other option, resulting in me selling to John for the same price.

**Strategy:**

It's strategically sound to accept this offer, as it secures my minimum profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. While I could try for a slightly higher price, the likelihood of success is low, and the potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
