"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.",10200.0,Alice,5,
