"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal from Alice.  Even if the negotiation goes back and forth, you have room to lower the price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target of $8,000. 
* **Avoiding John:**  This counteroffer is still better than buying from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  Alice's offer of $9,300 is a good price for you. It's lower than your initial counteroffer and only slightly more than your target price of $8,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse to go lower. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from Alice for $9,300 is significantly better than paying John $10,000.

**Conclusion:**  At this point, it's worth accepting Alice's offer to secure a good deal."
