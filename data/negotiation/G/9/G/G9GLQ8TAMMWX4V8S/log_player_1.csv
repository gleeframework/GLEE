Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is considerably below the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer represents the exact midpoint between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a significantly higher price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating that his offer is significantly below the product's worth, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value and the potential benefits he'd be getting. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong counter, it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't immediately convinced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to come down, and that's good. However, $1,125,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his original offer, with increments that don't justify the potential profit I'd be losing. While he *might* eventually go higher, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. 

John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is already more than Bob's current offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
