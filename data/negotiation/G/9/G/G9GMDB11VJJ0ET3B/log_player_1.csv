"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that owning this will be a rewarding investment for you."",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer ($1,300,000) establishes a strong anchoring point for the negotiation. This leaves room for me (Alice) to make concessions throughout the rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price given my valuation and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's a step in the right direction, accepting now would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is considerably less than what I value the product at.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product."",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $150,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark, which ensures I don't settle for less than what John is offering. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not there yet. We are still in relatively early rounds, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push Bob closer to the $1,000,000 mark.  There's a chance Bob might be getting anxious as the negotiation progresses and could concede more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while also acknowledging your budget considerations.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a strategic attempt to meet Bob closer to the middle ground. While it's a concession from my previous offer, it's still significantly above Bob's last offer and keeps me firmly above my $1,000,000 baseline.
* **Framing as a Compromise:**  By explicitly stating that this price reflects both the product's value and Bob's budget, I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and encouraging him to accept.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially continue negotiating, keeping the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price for the product, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that $975,000 is a fair price, representing a significant step closer to my initial offer and a reasonable compromise on both sides. Let's try to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, his pace is too slow. It's unlikely he'll reach my $1,000,000 minimum in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer.  Holding out for more from Bob at this point presents too much risk of ending up with a worse deal, even if there's a small chance he could offer more."
