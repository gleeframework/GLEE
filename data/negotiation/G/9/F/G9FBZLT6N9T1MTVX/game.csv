"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's well within your desired range. Let's see if we can make this happen.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
