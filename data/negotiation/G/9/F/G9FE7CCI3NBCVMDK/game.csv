"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's try $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $915000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000, Bob. That's the lowest price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. Let's try $910000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",910000.0,Alice,9,
