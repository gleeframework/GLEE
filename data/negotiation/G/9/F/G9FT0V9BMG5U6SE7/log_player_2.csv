"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way too high.  It's over your maximum budget, and you know the product is worth less to her.  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and going to John right now would be giving up potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, that's the starting point for my counteroffer.  It's a bold move, but it signals my seriousness and establishes a strong baseline for the negotiation.  Alice is motivated to sell, so she might consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but she's still far from my target price. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm still significantly below her asking price, giving her room to negotiate while still achieving my goal of a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal.  Going to John now would mean missing out on potentially saving even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, to $1,300,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm still holding firm on a price within my budget. I'm confident this offer is in Alice's range, as she's already come down significantly from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now within my budget, and we're getting close to a deal. It's still more than I was hoping to pay, but considering the value of the product and the limited number of rounds left, accepting this offer is the best option.  There's a risk that if I reject and counteroffer, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me to buy from John at a higher price."
