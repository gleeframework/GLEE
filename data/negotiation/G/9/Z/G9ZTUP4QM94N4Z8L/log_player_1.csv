Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to come down in price if Bob counters, while still getting a good profit. 
* **It's appealing to Bob:**  $9,500 is still below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it a potentially attractive deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more from Bob.  You know he values the product at $10,000, so there's room for a counteroffer that's more profitable than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still profitable:** $8,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  $8,500 is still within his budget, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer of $8,500. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at $8,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also valuing your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he won't budge from his offer of $8,000.  Since that's your minimum, there's no further room for negotiation. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price without any further time spent negotiating."
