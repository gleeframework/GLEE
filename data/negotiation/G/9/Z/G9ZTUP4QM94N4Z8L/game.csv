"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at $8,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also valuing your product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
