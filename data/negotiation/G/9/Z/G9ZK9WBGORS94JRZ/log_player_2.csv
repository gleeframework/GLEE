Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing to offer the product for $9,250. This is a compromise considering both the perceived value to you and the cost to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this offer is close enough to my target price. It's not worth the risk of her going up in price again, or of missing out on the deal entirely."
