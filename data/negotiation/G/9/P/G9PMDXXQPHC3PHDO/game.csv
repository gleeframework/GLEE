"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000 to move this deal forward. I believe this revised offer reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $2,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'll offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from. This product does represent a significant investment. I've tried to be flexible, and to meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $2,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $2,050,000, so I'll offer $1,975,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1975000.0,Bob,6,
