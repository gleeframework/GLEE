Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it would be valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to Alice's minimum ($10,000) might make Bob think the product is less valuable and could offend him. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While John provides a safety net, Alice wants to maximize her profit by selling to Bob if possible."
