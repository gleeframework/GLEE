"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since both Alice and John are offering the product at the same price of $1,500,000, it makes no difference who you buy from. You can accept Alice's offer as it's the same price as John's offer, and you don't have any additional information to suggest a better deal might be available elsewhere."
