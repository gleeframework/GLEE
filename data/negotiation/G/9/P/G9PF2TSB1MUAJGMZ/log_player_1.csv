Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,200,000 (what I'll get from John if Bob rejects)
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I want to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob.  A price of $1,450,000 splits the difference between our desired outcomes, making it a fair offer.

This offer gives me a good chance of maximizing my earnings while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
