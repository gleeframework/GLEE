"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $600,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I'm confident that we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $650,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $650,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
