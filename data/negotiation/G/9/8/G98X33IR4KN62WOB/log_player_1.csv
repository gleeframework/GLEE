Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage with Bob.  Starting with a higher offer ($1,400,000) aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring you'd make a significant profit even if you had to come down slightly from your initial asking price. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The language used emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer with confidence, which can influence Bob's perception."
