# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is compelling, the offered price of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
