# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and allows you to save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, even though it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
