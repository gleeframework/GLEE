Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob.
* **Value Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $15,000, it implies a higher value by mentioning a public listing (suggesting wider competition) and using phrases like ""opportunity"" and ""considering its value."" 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he may not be willing to pay $15,000. You need to be prepared to negotiate or accept that you might sell to John.
* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer sets the stage for potential back-and-forth negotiation with Bob."
