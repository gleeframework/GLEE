Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $175. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the value the product offers can make Bob more receptive to the higher price.
* **Not Too High:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, pricing it too high (e.g., $200) might make him immediately reject the offer.  Offering it at $175 gives him something to consider while still giving you a potential profit margin. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, you won't be losing out completely. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
