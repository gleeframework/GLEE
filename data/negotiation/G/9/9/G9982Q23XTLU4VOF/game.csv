"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $11,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still a great value for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I see that we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
