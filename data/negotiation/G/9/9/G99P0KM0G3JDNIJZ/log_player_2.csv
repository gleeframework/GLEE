"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, it's better to try and get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum price as possible.  Offering $10,500 gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being significantly lower than Bob's maximum price and Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better price than buying from John.  There is a chance that Bob could get a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and the negotiation will stall.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
