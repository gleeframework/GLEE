Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I'm starting to think we're too far apart, and I'd rather explore other options. However, I'll make one final offer: $810,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While still above our ideal price, Alice has signaled this is her final offer.  Continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice walk away entirely.  Accepting at $810,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
