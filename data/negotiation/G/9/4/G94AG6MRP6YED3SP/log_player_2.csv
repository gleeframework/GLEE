"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to secure the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, but it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  There is a chance that Bob could negotiate further and get a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up paying $1,000,000 to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
