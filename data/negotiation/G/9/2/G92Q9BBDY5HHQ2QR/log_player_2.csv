# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $400,000."
