"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000). Bob should reject the offer and buy from John for a lower price."
