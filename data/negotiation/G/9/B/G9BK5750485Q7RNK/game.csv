"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value while also allowing for a fair profit margin for you.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a fair offer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? This would give us both a good deal and hopefully bring us closer to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
