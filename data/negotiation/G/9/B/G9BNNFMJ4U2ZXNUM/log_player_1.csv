Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good profit for me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $135. It's a slight compromise from my initial offer but still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $132.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $140,  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate.  $132 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
