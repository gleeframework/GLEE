"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product, which I believe will bring significant value to you. Given its worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $9,500. This price reflects my desire to make a mutually beneficial transaction, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair and reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than what you could get it from John. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a much better price."
