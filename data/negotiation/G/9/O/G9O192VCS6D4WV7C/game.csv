"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. ",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
