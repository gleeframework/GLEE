"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
