Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175 offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a profit.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a friendly and encouraging way to make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am only able to offer $140 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for just $140.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $155? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($140). This shows a willingness to compromise while still being closer to my desired price point.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $145 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Although I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck with a lower price or prolonging the process outweighs the potential for getting a slightly better price from Bob.  Selling to John for $150 is the most logical choice, as it guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
