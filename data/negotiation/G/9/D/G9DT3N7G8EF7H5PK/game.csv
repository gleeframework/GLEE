"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential for profit, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counter offering. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product and the return on investment it can deliver. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents a good investment opportunity, but  $1,800,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer  $1,250,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to make this work. So, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that final offer is still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
