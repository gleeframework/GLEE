"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a stretch for me. I can do $7,500. That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
