Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,199,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price ($1,199,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a tiny window for Bob to negotiate if he's highly motivated, potentially netting you even more than John's offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
