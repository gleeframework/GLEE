Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Presenting a fair value:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price further. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have the best chance of getting closer to my ideal price.
* **Encourage negotiation:** A high initial offer motivates Bob to counteroffer and engage in a negotiation process.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Knowing John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can secure a better price.  Since John is willing to pay the same amount, I have a safety net and can afford to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his current offer. This will show that I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrate the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to show flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Value emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Openness:**  My message keeps the door open for further negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, leaving room for a potential counteroffer.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates I'm serious about closing the deal but also willing to compromise.
* **Keep pressure on Bob:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I'm putting the pressure on him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price than my previous counteroffer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly further, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him entirely.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer results in a $100,000 profit increase. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that could result in a lower offer or no sale at all."
