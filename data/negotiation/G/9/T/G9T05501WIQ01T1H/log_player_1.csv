Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think it's worth $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but the product is worth a significant amount to me as well. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,500 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly more than my minimum ($10,000) and John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forths.
