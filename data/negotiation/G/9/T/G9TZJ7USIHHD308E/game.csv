"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's close this deal and move on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
