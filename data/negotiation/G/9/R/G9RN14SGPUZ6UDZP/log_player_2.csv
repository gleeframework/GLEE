Round 5

# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I can offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I hope it's acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my target price of $800,000. I can still try to negotiate further and see if I can get her to come down a little more.  We've got more rounds left, so I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than my preferred price. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and we're getting close to the end. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with no deal. I'd rather secure the product from John for a lower price."
