{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still relatively high.  As Bob, I want to try and negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to budge."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a price closer to $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the potential value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has come down from $875,000 to $870,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  The price is now only $10,000 away from Bob's last offer, and there are still 5 rounds left.
