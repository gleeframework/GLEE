I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It reflects the product's value to me:**  While I'm willing to sell for $1,000,000, I believe it's worth more.

I'm eager to see if Bob is interested at this price, and if not, what counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too close to my minimum. I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up with a price that's not worth it.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000."
