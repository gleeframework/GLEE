{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit. 
* **It's a ""round"" number:**  This makes it easier for Bob to process and respond. 

Remember, this is just the first step! You'll need to be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum.  While it's tempting to take the $11,000, you're better off holding out for a better price. You can still get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  This shows Bob that you're serious about getting a fair price for your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you're aiming for higher, Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to your minimum acceptable price.  You've already rejected his initial offer of $11,000, and you've made a counteroffer at $13,000. At this point, further negotiation may lead to more back and forth, potentially causing delays and not guaranteeing a better price.  

Accepting Bob's offer at $12,500 secures a good deal that is close to your desired outcome without risking further delays or a lower price."
