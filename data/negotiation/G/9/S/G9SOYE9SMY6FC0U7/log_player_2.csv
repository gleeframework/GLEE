"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this valuable item.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the mutual interest in closing this deal, we propose a price of $13,200 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise between our values. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:**  $13,200 is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob has already made several counteroffers. 
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer and tries to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either walk away or offer a price closer to her own valuation, which could be closer to $13,500.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible move for Bob at this point. He secures the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoids the potential for a further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
