"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise.  This is still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's find a way to make this work!",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $8,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
