# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident that you'll appreciate its worth and be willing to make a serious investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and it's a significant saving compared to buying from John."
