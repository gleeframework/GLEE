Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, as it's better to engage in a negotiation than to potentially lose a sale.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. I'll only accept an offer from Bob if it's equal to or higher than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it's still worth exploring if a counteroffer can be reached. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  Knowing that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial bid. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, allowing me to accept if Bob counteroffers with something close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I believe $9,000 would be a fair price for both of us. It's still within my budget, while also reflecting the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still not high enough for me to accept.
* **No Need to Risk It:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is a significantly better deal than Bob's offer. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a better offer, but it also risks delaying the sale and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John ensures a secure and profitable transaction, which is my priority."
