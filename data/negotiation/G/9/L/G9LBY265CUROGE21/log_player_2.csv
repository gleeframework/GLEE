"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I can do $1,285,000. This is my final offer for now. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for you, Bob. You're getting the product for $15,000 less than your initial goal and Alice seems firm on her price.  Waiting longer might push her away from the deal."
