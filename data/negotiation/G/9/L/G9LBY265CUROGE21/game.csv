"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I can do $1,285,000. This is my final offer for now. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll need to consider other options.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
