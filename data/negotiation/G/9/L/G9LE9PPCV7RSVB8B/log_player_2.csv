```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. We have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John, which meets our budget.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk paying more by continuing with Alice."
