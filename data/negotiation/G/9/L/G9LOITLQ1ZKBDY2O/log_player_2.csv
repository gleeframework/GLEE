"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is certainly intriguing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can bring substantial returns for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $900,000. This reflects its true worth while recognizing your investment.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good price for Bob. He's already saved $100,000 compared to buying from John, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or force him to accept John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids further risk."
