"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering the value it brings to me. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly special.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product. This reflects a further compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $800000. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being within your budget.",850000.0,Alice,5,
