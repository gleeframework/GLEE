"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's potential for a good counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $999,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly special.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to compromise, but her counteroffer is still relatively high. You've already negotiated a significant reduction from her initial price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $800000. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being within your budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While you could continue negotiating, her final offer is within your budget and represents a good deal.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price, and there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal altogether.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
