,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford that price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and still reflects the inherent value this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the value I place on the product, and I'm confident it's a price you can reasonably accept.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While I see you're serious about this purchase, we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  I believe this offer fairly considers the value of the product and our respective positions.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not able to meet your price.  I understand the value of the product, but I can only go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant offer and I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a very similar price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great owner for this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your need to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
