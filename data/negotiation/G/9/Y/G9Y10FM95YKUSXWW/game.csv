"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant step towards meeting you in the middle, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work. Would you consider $1,550,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm not comfortable going above $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
