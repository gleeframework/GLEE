"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This adjustment reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
