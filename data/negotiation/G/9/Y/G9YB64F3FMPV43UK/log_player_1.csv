{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a reasonable starting point:**  It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's $12,000.
* **Friendly and optimistic tone:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation strong:**  A higher initial offer can lead to a better final deal.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  It's likely Bob will counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to adjust my price or even get closer to my minimum of $12,000.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  I still have the fallback option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John now and be guaranteed $12,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  My aim is to gradually move the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $10,500 is a compromise between my minimum of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Keeps the negotiation open:**  The message is still positive and encouraging, showing flexibility while maintaining my position. 
* **Highlights the product's value:**  I emphasize the product's value to remind Bob of its worth.

This strategy aims to:

* **Move the price closer to my goal:**  $10,500 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  This approach demonstrates I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. 
* **Maintain pressure on Bob:**  By making a counteroffer, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale and that he needs to come up with a better price to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, his offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, even though I've already rejected one of his offers.

I will reject Bob's offer again and make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim to get closer to my desired price of $12,000 while still showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9,800 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,150. This reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving the price up slightly:** I'm increasing the price slightly from my last offer ($10,500) to $10,150. This shows that I'm not willing to budge too much but still open to negotiation.
* **""Meeting you halfway"" approach:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Reiterating the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Encouraging a response:** I'm asking a direct question to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This strategy aims to:

* **Push the price higher:**  I'm aiming to inch closer to my goal of $12,000.
* **Maintain a sense of urgency:** By showing a willingness to compromise but not completely caving, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to accept my offer.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to drop below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get a bit closer. Would you be willing to consider $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has been inching closer to my minimum price, his offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum of $12,000. We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not convinced I can get him to go any higher.  

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price below my minimum, I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
