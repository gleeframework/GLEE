"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. Would you be willing to consider $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9,800 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,150. This reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
