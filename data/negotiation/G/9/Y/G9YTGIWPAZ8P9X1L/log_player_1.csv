Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk of losing out completely. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale is made."
