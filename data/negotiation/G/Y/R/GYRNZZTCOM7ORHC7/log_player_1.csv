Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

Bob's offer:

I think this is a fair price considering the value you've already acknowledged it has. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which matches Bob's current offer, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
