"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,900,000 reflects what I believe the product is truly worth, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,650,000. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've already acknowledged it has. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
