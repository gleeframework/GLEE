"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth it to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm making a profit from the deal. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell below my minimum.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm confident you'll still find this a great value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
