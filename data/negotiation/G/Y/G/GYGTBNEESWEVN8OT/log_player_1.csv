Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price.  This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$9,000 is too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $10,500. It's a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still too low.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's a sure thing, and I get my desired price."
