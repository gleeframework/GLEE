"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject the offer. The product is too expensive for me, and I can get it from John for a much better price.
