"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $13,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $13,000 is still stretching my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself.  How about $11,500?  That's a significant price drop and puts us much closer to a deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
