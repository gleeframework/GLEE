Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to my target, I'm confident that we can still reach a better agreement. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
