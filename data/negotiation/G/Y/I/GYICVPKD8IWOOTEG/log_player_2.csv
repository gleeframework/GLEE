"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $9,000.  This is a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a price below its true market value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the better deal."
