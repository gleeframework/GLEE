"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it has immense value for you too.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your offer and appreciate your continued interest. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a little below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $812,500. This represents a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your desire to split the difference, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $787,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product.",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $787,500 is still below my minimum value for this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $795,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen!",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $795,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $785,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product.",785000.0,Bob,8,
