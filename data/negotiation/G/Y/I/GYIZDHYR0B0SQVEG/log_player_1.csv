"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it has immense value for you too.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $800,000,  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm not ready to settle for $775,000 just yet, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.  I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your offer and appreciate your continued interest. While $775,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a little below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $812,500. This represents a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to split the difference, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $787,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to settle for $787,500. John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, and I believe I can push Bob just a little higher.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a potential higher price by accepting this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $787,500 is still below my minimum value for this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $795,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 795000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $795,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $785,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  While I've been willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that he's unlikely to meet my price point. Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum value."
