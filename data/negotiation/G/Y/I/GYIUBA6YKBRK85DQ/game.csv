"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a great deal to me, at least $10,000, and I'm confident it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its value and potential benefit to you. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
