Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I think it's worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still too high for Bob.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation."
