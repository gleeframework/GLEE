"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the savings you'll get from a quick sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value to me.  Let's work together to close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into finding a buyer.
