"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1250000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
