"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $700,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, and it's closer to your value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach an agreement, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer a compromise at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",850000.0,Alice,5,
