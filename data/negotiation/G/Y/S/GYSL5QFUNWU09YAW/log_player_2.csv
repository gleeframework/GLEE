You're in a great position! Alice's offer is well below your maximum budget and potentially a good deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  There's still room for compromise, and you're in a good position because your maximum price is higher than what Alice is willing to accept."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach an agreement, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
