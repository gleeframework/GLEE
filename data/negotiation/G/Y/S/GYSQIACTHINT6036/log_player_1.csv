Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be really useful for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for you to increase the price if he's willing to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  You're not asking for the full $150, showing you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get a better deal. You can potentially get closer to your desired price of $130 by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $115 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than minimum:** $107 is above your minimum price of $100.
* **Close to your target:**  It's a good compromise, getting you closer to your desired $115.
* **Risk of rejection:** If you reject this offer, you risk Bob walking away or further lowering his offer. 
* **John's offer:**  While you can sell to John for $100, Bob's offer is only slightly less and is more likely to lead to a sale."
