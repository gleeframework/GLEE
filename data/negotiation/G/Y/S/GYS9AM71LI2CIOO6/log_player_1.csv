"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my initial offer and Bob's potential value. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Would you be interested in paying $8,500 for the product?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  While John's offer is a guaranteed $8,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I think I can push Bob a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $8,125? It's a fair compromise, and it's still below the value you placed on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm getting closer to being ready to close this deal. What if we settled at $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is very close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm only two rounds away from having to make a decision, and I believe I can push Bob just a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
