Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This reflects the product's potential while recognizing your initial investment.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
