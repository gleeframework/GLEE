"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a good investment. 
* **Alternative Option:** By keeping John's offer ($1,500,000) in mind, I have a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with an offer closer to my target while still leaving space for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This reflects the product's potential while recognizing your initial investment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've countered with a price that's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This strategy aims to signal flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Justification:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's ""true market value"" to nudge Bob closer to my target price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With seven rounds remaining, I have time for further negotiation. However, I want to make substantial progress in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has significantly increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating seriousness and willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
