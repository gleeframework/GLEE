"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This reflects the product's potential while recognizing your initial investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing negotiations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
