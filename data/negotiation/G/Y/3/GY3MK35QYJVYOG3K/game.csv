"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $650,000? I think that's a fair price that could work for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $700,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? This allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good price. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
