"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
