"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $9,500 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still remaining within his budget. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while also testing Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than her initial price, Bob can still aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer allows Bob to test Alice's flexibility while keeping the deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though it's slightly lower than her previous one. Bob is determined to get the best possible price and believes he can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer to show Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still trying to keep the price within his budget. This offer is a small increase from his previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still not a good deal.  Bob has a few rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's also considering the option of buying from John if he can't get a better price from Alice.  It's worth taking one more round to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing his luck a bit here. Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum, but he has only 2 rounds left. He's betting that Alice is motivated to close the deal and will accept his counteroffer, as it's still below her offer and significantly below his maximum. If Alice rejects, he'll likely have to accept her offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's limit.  He only has one round left, and there's a high chance Alice will reject his next counteroffer.  Buying from John for $15,000 is the safer option at this point, as it guarantees Bob will get the product and avoid the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
