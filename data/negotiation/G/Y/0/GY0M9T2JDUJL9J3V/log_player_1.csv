"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation, which is important in a multi-round process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  I have a strong alternative (selling to John) which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $145?  This would still give you a good deal and help me reach a price that works for me."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by explaining that it's a compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value for Bob by mentioning that it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer.  I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John, as the negotiation is taking longer than expected."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about getting this, this is our last offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firmness:**  I'm making it clear that $140 is my final offer. This adds urgency and pressure to Bob.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of the benefits.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm hinting at the possibility of selling to John to further increase the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob is going to come up to a price that's acceptable to me. Given the time constraint (only 10 rounds) and the fact that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
