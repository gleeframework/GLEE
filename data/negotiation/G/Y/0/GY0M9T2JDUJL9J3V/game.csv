"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $145?  This would still give you a good deal and help me reach a price that works for me.",145.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about getting this, this is our last offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
