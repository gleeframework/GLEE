"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $8000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would let me get this product I'm really interested in.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8500, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best deal you'll get, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
