"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a fair agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm also seeing a desire for this product. While your offer is closer to the mark, there's still a gap to bridge. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
