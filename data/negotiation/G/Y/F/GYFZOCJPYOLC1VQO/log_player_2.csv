Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
