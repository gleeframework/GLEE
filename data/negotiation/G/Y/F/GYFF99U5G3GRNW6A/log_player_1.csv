{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice has a safety net.  Offering the product to Bob first allows her to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * Bob gets the product for $400,000 less than it's worth to him.
    * Alice makes a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning a ""one-time offer"", Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
