# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $80 from John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
