Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'd be willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $875,000 offer secures a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether."
