"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the immense value I know it holds. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Given your valuation of $1200000, I'm willing to pay $1350000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you've outlined.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Considering the inherent value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. I'm confident this price still reflects the unique benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle at $1375000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
