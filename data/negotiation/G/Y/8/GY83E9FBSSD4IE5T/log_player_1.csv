Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,500,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses a confident tone to emphasize the value of the product, subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than the asking price.

By starting high, I increase my chances of securing a deal significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
