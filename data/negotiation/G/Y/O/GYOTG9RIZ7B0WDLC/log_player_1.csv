Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This allows room for negotiation and leaves a comfortable profit margin if accepted. However, it's also a price that I believe is reasonable, given the potential value of the product to Bob. 

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I cannot accept such a drastic price reduction. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, I'm satisfied with this outcome.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, potentially leading to a lower price or a complete impasse. Additionally, selling to Bob secures a sale, while selling to John might introduce uncertainties or delays."
