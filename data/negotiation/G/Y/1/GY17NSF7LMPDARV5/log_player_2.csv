"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Buying from John saves you $100,000 and meets your goal of spending no more than $1,000,000."
