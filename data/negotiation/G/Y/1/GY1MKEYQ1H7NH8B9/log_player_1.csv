Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer the product at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149, just below my minimum acceptable price, creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer more appealing to Bob. He might be swayed by the ""deal"" even if it's slightly above his perceived value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob will reject this offer, and I'll have to settle for $150 from John. However, the potential to earn an extra dollar makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
