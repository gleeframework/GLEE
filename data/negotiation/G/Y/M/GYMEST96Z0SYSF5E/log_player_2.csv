"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You know you can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a bold move, but it signals my intent to negotiate and potentially forces Alice to reveal her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John if necessary, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a substantial discount. By moving closer to Alice's previous offer, I'm showing good faith while keeping some room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original asking price. It's clear she's not willing to budge further. It's now in my best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation. There's no point in risking another few rounds with Alice, potentially ending up with the same price I could get from John now."
