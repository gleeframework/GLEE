Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to sell above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000. This makes the offer highly appealing to Bob while securing a significant profit for you (Alice). 
* **First Right of Refusal:** By approaching Bob first at this attractive price, we increase the chances of a quick and profitable sale. 
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while ensuring the offer is compelling enough for Bob to accept."
