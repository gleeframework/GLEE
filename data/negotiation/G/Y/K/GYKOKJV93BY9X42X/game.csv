"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000 and go from there?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a more reasonable compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position but $1,075,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down to $1,125,000, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  Please let me know.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
