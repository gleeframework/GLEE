"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product offers.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",7800.0,Bob,4,
