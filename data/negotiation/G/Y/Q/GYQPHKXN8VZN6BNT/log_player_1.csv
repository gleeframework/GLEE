``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you consider $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I'd like to save a bit more

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $115.  I'll counter with something a little higher than $108 to see if I can convince him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet at $112.  It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $112. Can you consider $109? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, I'm concerned that I'm running out of rounds. Accepting $109 is still a better deal than selling to John for $100. I'm going to take this offer and close the deal."
