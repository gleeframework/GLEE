"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet at $112.  It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.",112.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $112. Can you consider $109? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget",109.0,Bob,6,
