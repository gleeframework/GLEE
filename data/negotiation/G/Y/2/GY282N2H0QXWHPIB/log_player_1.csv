Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice comfortably above her minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below that price.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Direct and Professional:**  Gets straight to the point of the offer.
* **Value-Oriented:** Highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob."
