# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still think $825,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice seems pretty firm on a price well above my target.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I'd rather secure the product from John at my maximum budget than risk losing it entirely."
