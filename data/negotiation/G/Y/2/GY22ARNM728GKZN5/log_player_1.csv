Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Offers:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he's shown interest in the product. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product is well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door completely. I'm proposing a price that's still higher than my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for the middle ground signals my willingness to compromise and could entice Bob to accept.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the value in my proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still a chance he might be willing to go higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the guarantee of $8,000 from John. 

**Strategy:** I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to my minimum.  If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your hesitation.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for a product that will be a valuable asset to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final counteroffer, as I've already reached my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Closing:**  The message is firm and confident, leaving no room for further negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth again to reinforce the value of the deal. 

**Strategy:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,200 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **No room for negotiation:** Bob is signaling he's close to walking away, so I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him.
* **Guaranteed offer from John:** John is willing to pay $8,000, which is a better deal than anything Bob is offering. 

**Conclusion:** It's time to move on. I'll take John's offer and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
