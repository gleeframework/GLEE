"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a while, and I know it would be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,000.** This is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John would cost $12,000.**  This means you can save $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save money."
