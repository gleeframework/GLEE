"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business. Based on its potential and your needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This reflects the significant value it holds and allows for a profitable partnership. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still allows for a strong profit for me and a significant return on investment for you.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and the profit you would still make. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you loud and clear. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this deal work, I need to be at $925,000. This is a small step from my last offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $912,500? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a good deal. I'm confident we can close this deal quickly at this price. ",912500.0,Bob,6,
