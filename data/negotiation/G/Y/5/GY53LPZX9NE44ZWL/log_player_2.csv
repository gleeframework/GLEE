"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business. Based on its potential and your needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This reflects the significant value it holds and allows for a profitable partnership. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. 
* Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and should aim to get the price down further. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price still allows for a strong profit for me and a significant return on investment for you.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* Bob has 7 rounds remaining and should continue to negotiate. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to bring the price down even further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and the profit you would still make. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you loud and clear. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this deal work, I need to be at $925,000. This is a small step from my last offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still a bit higher than he wants to pay. 
* Bob has 5 rounds remaining to negotiate and should continue to try and bring the price down.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
