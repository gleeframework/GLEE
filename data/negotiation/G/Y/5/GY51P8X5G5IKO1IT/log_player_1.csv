Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold strategy, but it sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John, but I'll explore this negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $900,000. This is a significant concession, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not interested in a drawn-out negotiation. I'm confident I can get the same price from John with no hassle. Therefore, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $800,000."
