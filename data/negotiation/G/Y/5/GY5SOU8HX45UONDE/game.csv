"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to both of us. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're seeking.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budgetary constraints, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  I'm prepared to accept $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline at $875,000. Given my financial situation, I am only able to consider offers closer to my original budget of $850,000. I would like to propose an offer of $860,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",860000.0,Bob,4,
