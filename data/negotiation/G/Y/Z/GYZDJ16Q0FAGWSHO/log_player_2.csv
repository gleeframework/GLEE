# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is compelling, $12,000 is significantly higher than your $8,000 budget and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at a much lower price."
