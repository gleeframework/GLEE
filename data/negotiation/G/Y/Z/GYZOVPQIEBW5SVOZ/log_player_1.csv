Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While $145 is above Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be swayed if he's particularly interested in the product. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're guaranteed to sell it to John for $150, meeting your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a reasonable chance of securing a deal with Bob."
