Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive opportunity,"" subtly creating a sense of scarcity and desirability.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, by setting the price closer to his perceived value, we increase the likelihood of securing a deal that's much more profitable than selling to John."
