"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraint. However, I can't go as low as $10000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to maintain a fair price for my product.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
