"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1500000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, and I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum. I'll meet you at $1300000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and quality.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to go to $1200000, and I believe this reflects the value we both see in this product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and quality.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
