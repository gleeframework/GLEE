{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a price that I'm comfortable with, considering my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than her previous price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as I am willing to pay up to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is finally within my budget and a good compromise.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or having to buy from John at $8,000."
