"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I am interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain a fair pricing strategy. I am unable to match your proposed price of $7,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $9,000 for the product?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
