"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I still think there's a bit of a gap. How about $775,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more about the minimum I'm willing to accept, and $775,000 is still a bit below that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
