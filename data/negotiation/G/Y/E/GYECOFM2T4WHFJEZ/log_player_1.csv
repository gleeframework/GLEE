Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get close to my desired value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $152 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
