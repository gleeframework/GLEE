Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way people work.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in a product that has a high return on investment. Would you be willing to come down to $500000? I believe this price reflects the potential of this product and is a fair compromise for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the return on investment, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its potential returns. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $625000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $625000.  That's a good step in the right direction. However, I still need to be convinced that this price is fair, given my investment goals.  Let's split the difference and meet at $562500. I'm confident this price will allow both of us to walk away happy.",562500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $562500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $600000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value and your investment goals. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $600000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not there yet. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $562500. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",562500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $562500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $585000. This is a compromise that takes into account your investment goals and the product's value. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.
