Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,250,000. I'm confident this represents a fair price given its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($2,250,000) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price, even though it's significantly more than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Alternative Option:**  While you have John as a backup, your goal is to maximize profit.  Don't reveal this alternative to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Remember, Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering a price significantly higher means you need to be prepared to negotiate or have strong arguments for the product's value exceeding Bob's initial perception.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you reach the best possible outcome."
