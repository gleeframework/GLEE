"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite convinced that $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you countering.  While I value meeting in the middle, the product's value to you is undeniable. Let's settle at $930,000. It's a competitive price considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",930000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",920000.0,Bob,4,
