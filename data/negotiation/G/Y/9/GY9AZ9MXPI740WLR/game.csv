"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering both our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,200,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price offers a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However,  $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000. This price is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's fair given the potential value of the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,290,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
