Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, offering the product with a clear price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I earn $140, exceeding my minimum price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I can then sell to John for my guaranteed $150.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing my potential profit while still offering Bob a fair chance to purchase the product."
