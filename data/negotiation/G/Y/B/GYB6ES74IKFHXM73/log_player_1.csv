"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, this is the best price I can give you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Can you reconsider and meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting closer to what I want.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk losing the sale entirely.  There's also the chance that John might not be interested in buying anymore if we continue to negotiate with Bob."
