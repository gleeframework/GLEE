"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product higher than me, it's likely he'll at least consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit above $135. How about $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my desired price. I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether or having to deal with further negotiations."
