"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12,000 to you. I am offering it to you for $10,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at an attractive price.",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the value of our offering. I am unable to match your proposed price of $8,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we consider $9,000 as the new offer price?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $8,750. Would that be feasible?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to consider $8,900 as the final offer price for our product. This represents a significant discount from its original value, and I believe it provides a fair compromise. I hope this meets your requirements.",8900.0,Alice,5,
