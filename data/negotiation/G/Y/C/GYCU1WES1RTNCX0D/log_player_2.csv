"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $9,500. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still not ideal.** You value the product at $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for even less. 
* **You have the leverage.**  You know John is willing to sell for $10,000, giving you a fallback option.  
* **Negotiate further.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially encourage her to lower the price to get a sale. You might be able to get the product for closer to your $8,000 valuation."
