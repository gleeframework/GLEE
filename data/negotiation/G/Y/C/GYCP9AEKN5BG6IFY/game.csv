"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $106, but I'd like to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal.
