"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, there's no benefit to rejecting the offer.  Buying from John would cost the same amount.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product without exceeding his budget."
