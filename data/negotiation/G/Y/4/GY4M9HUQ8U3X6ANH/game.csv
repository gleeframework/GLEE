"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. My final offer is $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Bob,4,
