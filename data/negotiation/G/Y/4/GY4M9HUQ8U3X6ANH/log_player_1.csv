Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language (""great deal"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter if needed, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, which is my ideal outcome.  However, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""good deal"") and framing my counteroffer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""finalize this deal"" suggests a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to accept my offer. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** $10,500 is a strategic compromise, allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit while leaving space for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. My final offer is $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Bob has indicated this is his ""final offer,"" meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  Given the limited negotiation space and Bob's final offer being unacceptable, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price."
