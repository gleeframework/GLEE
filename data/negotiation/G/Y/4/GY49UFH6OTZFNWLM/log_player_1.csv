Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer gives me a good chance to make a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob. It's slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is only $500 above my minimum, which isn't a huge gain for me. I'm willing to take the risk of another round and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000, but it's still a good amount above my minimum.  This demonstrates flexibility while keeping the price attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now only $250 less than my initial offer, and $750 above my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and losing time isn't worth it for a potential gain of just $250.  It's better to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
