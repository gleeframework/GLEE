Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($14,000 vs $12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the product's condition and value. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay my initial asking price.  I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob acknowledged the product's value. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore Higher Offers:** I can potentially get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Use John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I can always fall back on selling to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not settling for his initial price. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Win-Win Mentality:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, implying that it's a fair price that benefits both of us. 

This approach aims to continue the negotiation while keeping the potential for a higher price. It also demonstrates my flexibility and commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
