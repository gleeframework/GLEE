"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for $100,000 less from John. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
