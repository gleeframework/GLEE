"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That way, we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  If we can agree on that price, we can both move forward.  Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $90? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $89. That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'm going to go with John.  Let me know what you think.",89.0,Bob,6,
