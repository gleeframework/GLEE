Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is above your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:** This price is likely to be within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay if the product is truly valuable to him.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates that you are open to discussing the price, making Bob feel comfortable engaging in negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **You don't know Bob's value:**  This makes it tricky to gauge how high you can go. You have to balance maximizing profit with potentially losing the sale.
* **John's offer:** Remember, you have a guaranteed $8,000 from John. This is your fallback option, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses. If he seems interested but hesitant, you might lower the price slightly. If he rejects outright, you may need to offer a more substantial discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is below my minimum of $8,000. While I'd like to sell the product, I can't afford to lose money on it.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum of $8,000, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:** I'm offering $8,500, which is still above my minimum of $8,000 but shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** The message reiterates the product's value, reminding Bob why this price is justified.
* **Openness to agreement:** The message expresses a desire to ""find common ground,"" making Bob feel like a negotiation is possible.

**Rationale:**

This counteroffer is designed to find a middle ground. It signals that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  By offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7500 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum of $8,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell at a loss.  

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $8,000, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiations with Bob that are unlikely to result in a profitable deal."
