With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense. While Bob's latest offer is close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can get a better price in these final rounds.  Given the risk of not reaching an agreement, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirement."
