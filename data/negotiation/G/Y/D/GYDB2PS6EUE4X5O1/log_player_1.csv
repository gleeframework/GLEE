Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This is my upper limit for the price.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000 to make the sale worthwhile (John's offer).
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves me with a negotiation space of $700,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering $1,400,000, I'm close to Bob's perceived value, giving him a strong incentive to accept. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if needed.

**Why not go higher?**  

* While I could go higher, there's a risk that Bob will reject and I'll be stuck with John's lower offer. 
* This offer balances my desire for a high price with the need to make the deal happen."
