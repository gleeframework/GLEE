"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
