"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can push for a bit more, considering Bob is willing to pay a premium and acknowledges the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you've acknowledged. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I know Bob values the product, and with only 6 rounds left, I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're getting closer. How about $9,200? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get a better price.  It's risky to keep rejecting, but with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm willing to gamble that I can push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to come down to $9,100 for this product. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9100}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $8,600 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high.  While $8,600 is a tempting offer, it's not significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale than to risk losing out on any deal."
