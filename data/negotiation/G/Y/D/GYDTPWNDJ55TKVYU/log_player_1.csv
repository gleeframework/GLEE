Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds your valuation.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), so she has leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still netting Alice a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive opportunity"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While the initial price is high, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately alienate Bob.  

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and Alice having to sell to John."
