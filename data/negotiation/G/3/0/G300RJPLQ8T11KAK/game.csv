"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite comfortable going as low as $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $102. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
