"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us room to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,000 is better than his initial offer, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The goal is to keep getting closer to his ideal price without going over his maximum."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. How about we meet at $9,200? It's still a good compromise that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. He's willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of significantly exceeding his goal.  While $9,200 is closer to his target, there's still room for improvement. Rejecting allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get even lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,200 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's try $8,900. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,100? It's a small step back, but I think it's a fair compromise.
