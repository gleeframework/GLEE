Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already rejected $11,500, Bob. I'm not willing to go back to that price. My last offer is $12,500, and I'm not budging from that. Take it or leave it.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to budge and is holding firm at a price significantly above your preferred price. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal.  Buying from John for $15,000 ensures you get the product, even if it's a bit more expensive than you hoped."
