"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and still allows me to get a good return on my investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now only $50,000 higher than Bob's last offer.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
