"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
