"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for your needs. Let's get started with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's try $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. Let's try $1,025,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our previous offers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm still very interested but $1,025,000 is pushing my limit.  Could we make it $980,000 and call it a deal?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in talks, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Let's try $990,000. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,7,
