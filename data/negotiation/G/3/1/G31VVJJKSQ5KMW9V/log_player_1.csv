Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay slightly less. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 is just below my guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. There's a chance he might find the deal attractive enough, especially if I highlight it as such. 
* **Limited Time:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no way of knowing Bob's true valuation or his willingness to negotiate. If I had more information, I might adjust my approach."
