"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value and I want to find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
