,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9000, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $9000, which is $8875. Let's see if we can make a deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
