(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $10,900 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is a good price considering Alice's initial offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** The negotiation is progressing, with Alice demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice walking away or the deal going on for too long, potentially leading to the need to buy from John at a higher price.

This offer represents a solid compromise, and accepting it allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
