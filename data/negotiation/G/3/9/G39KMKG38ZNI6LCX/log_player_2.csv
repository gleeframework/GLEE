**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still trying to get more than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You've already stated your final offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in Alice dropping her price significantly. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and take John's offer, securing the product at the price you've determined is acceptable."
