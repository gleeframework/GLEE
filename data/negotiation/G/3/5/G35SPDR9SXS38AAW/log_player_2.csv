"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I can't disclose the exact nature of this product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1500000. This represents a significant potential upside for you, as the true value might be even higher. I understand this is a substantial investment, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile one. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice claims the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to her, but is selling it for $1,500,000. This suggests she might be trying to inflate the value.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the known, lower price."
