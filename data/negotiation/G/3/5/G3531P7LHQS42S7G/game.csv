"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant investment and reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident this product offers significantly more value. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me. To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
