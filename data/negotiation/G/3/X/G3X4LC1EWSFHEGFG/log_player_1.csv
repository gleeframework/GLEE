Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob, you could adjust the offer price and message accordingly."
