"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This would still allow you to save significantly compared to our initial offer, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
