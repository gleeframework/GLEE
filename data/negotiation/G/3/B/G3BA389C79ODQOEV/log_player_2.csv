"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from a starting offer that favors the buyer. This initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message acknowledges the product's value while firmly stating my price point. It aims to keep the conversation collaborative.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially move the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice decreased her price, but it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  Buying from John is a last resort if negotiations with Alice don't yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** I'm increasing my offer to demonstrate a willingness to move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the counteroffer (budget constraints) can help Alice understand my position.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to test Alice's bottom line and see if she's willing to negotiate within a range closer to my limit."
