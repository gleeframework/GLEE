"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget of $8,000, but my minimum price for this product is $10,000. It's a high-quality item that will be worth every penny for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000? If not, I'm happy to continue discussing a fair price, but I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
