Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $10,000. This allows you to aim higher with Bob."
