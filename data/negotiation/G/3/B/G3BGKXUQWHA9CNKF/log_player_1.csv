Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.
