"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm looking for a price around $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $2,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant drop, showing Bob's intent to negotiate.
* **Provides a clear price:** The counteroffer is specific and avoids ambiguity, making it easier for Alice to respond.
* **Maintains a positive tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, building a foundation for continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to walk away if the price isn't right, increasing his negotiation leverage.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Alice may be more willing to budge further in subsequent rounds to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:**  Bob reiterates his previous counteroffer, showing he's serious about his target price and not willing to budge significantly.
* **Positive yet assertive:**  The message remains polite but firm, leaving Alice with the impression that Bob is determined.
* **Focus on finality:** The message suggests a desire to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to consider accepting the offer."
