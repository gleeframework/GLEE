"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** We want to keep the tone positive and show Alice we're serious about purchasing the product, just at a lower price point. 
* **Targeting Below Value:**  Our goal is to pay less than what the product is worth to Alice ($12,000), so we start with a counteroffer of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to her actual value, but we still have room to negotiate.  While $14,000 is closer to our $12,000 walk-away point (buying from John), we can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be frank, $14,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We're moving closer to Alice's likely selling point while staying below our walk-away price. 
* **""Fair Compromise"":**  Framing this offer as a compromise can make it more appealing to Alice, especially as we are now in the middle of the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We're still significantly below her asking price, which maintains pressure for her to move closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $11,000 is still quite low.  What if we do this, $12,500 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is very close to her actual value, and we're also close to our walk-away point. However, there's still a chance we can get the price down a little further.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have five rounds remaining, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down those last few hundred dollars. 
* **John as Leverage:**  We can use the option of buying from John as leverage in our next counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is tempting, but I have to be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our best and final offer. We're explicitly stating our walk-away price and using the alternative offer (John) as leverage. 
* **Urgency:** We're creating a sense of urgency by implying we might buy from John soon.
* **Direct and Respectful:** We maintain a polite tone while being direct about our constraints and desired price. 

By this point, Alice is likely to accept as she's getting a fair price, and any further negotiation might make her lose the sale."
