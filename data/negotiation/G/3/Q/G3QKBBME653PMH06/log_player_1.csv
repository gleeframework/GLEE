Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $10,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $11,000 is still quite low.  What if we do this, $12,500 and we have a deal?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is tempting, but I have to be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.
