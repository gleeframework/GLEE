"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be frank, $14,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $11,000 is still quite low.  What if we do this, $12,500 and we have a deal?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is tempting, but I have to be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",12000.0,Bob,6,
