"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I secure a fair price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's potential for a deal closer to his $800,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This gives you a good deal, and leaves me with a reasonable profit. What do you say?

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. While it's closer to Bob's budget, there's room for further negotiation.  Bob should try to secure a price closer to his $800,000 limit."
