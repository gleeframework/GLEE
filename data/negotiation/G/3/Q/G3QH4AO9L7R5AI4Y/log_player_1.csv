Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.  I'm aiming to maximize profit, but also understanding that Bob has a higher value for the product, leaving room for a potential deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and leaves less room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price considering his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's closer to my desired outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
