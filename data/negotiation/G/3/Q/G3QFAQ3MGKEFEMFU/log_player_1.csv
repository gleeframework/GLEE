Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $12,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also positions me to potentially get a better price than John's offer of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what he initially offered, it's still below my minimum valuation of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  This is still a bit lower than my ideal price, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while also ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping for a better price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting increasingly closer to his initial valuation.  I'm at risk of getting into a price war with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum valuation of $15,000, so I'll take that option."
