"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product with incredible potential. I'm sure it would be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial price is $2000000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and has the potential to generate much higher returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which I believe is a fair price reflecting its value.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm confident in this product's potential, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm prepared to offer $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1400000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1500000. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's reach a final agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
