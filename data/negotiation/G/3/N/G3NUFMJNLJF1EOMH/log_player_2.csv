"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than John's price of $150, there's still room for negotiation. We know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's a potential for a price lower than $140.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go down to $130. Could you meet me halfway at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price of $150 and closer to our desired price point.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and stick to her $135 price, or we could end up with a worse deal.  Accepting the offer ensures we get the product for a reasonable price without unnecessary risk."
