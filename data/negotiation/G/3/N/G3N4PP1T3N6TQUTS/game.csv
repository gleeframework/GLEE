"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value and uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price closer to $950000? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I am unable to meet you at $1050000 due to my financial constraints. I will instead proceed to buy the product from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
