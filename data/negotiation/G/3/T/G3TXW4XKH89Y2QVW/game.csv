"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're still not comfortable with this price, I'm prepared to move on to other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I've already gone as high as I can, and I'm going to have to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
