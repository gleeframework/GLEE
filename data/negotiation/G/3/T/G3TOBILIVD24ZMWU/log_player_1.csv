Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the product as valuable, which could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $85 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below the product's true value to Bob. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This still leaves a good deal for you, and it's closer to the actual value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
