Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to make a good deal.
