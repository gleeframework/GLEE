"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and your potential interest in it.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to make a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference between our last offers and I'll offer $800000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to the buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
