"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still too high for the first round. Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but not so low that it instantly alienates Alice.
* **Justified:** He highlights the product's potential value, but also frames his offer as a fair compromise.
* **Sets the tone:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and will be actively negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, but Bob is still aiming to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and try to get closer to his desired price. He can use the information from Alice's offer to refine his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference between our last offers and I'll offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building on the negotiation:**  Bob acknowledges Alice's compromise but still maintains his desire for a lower price.
* **Splitting the difference:** This tactic is common in negotiation, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still achieving a better price.
* **Positive framing:** Bob frames the offer as fair and mutually beneficial, encouraging Alice to see the potential for a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value and the potential benefits it can bring to the buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:**  Alice has lowered her price considerably from the initial offer of $900,000.  Bob is now just $75,000 away from his initial counteroffer of $750,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more, accepting the offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds where Alice might become more resistant.
* **Time is money:**  With limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of running out of time and having to pay John's higher price."
