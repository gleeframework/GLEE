Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** My message emphasizes the value and potential benefits of the product, making it more enticing to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for counteroffers and gives me some negotiating room if Bob doesn't accept immediately.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get my minimum price if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and still have the option of John, who is willing to pay my desired price. This gives me leverage to try and get closer to my target.
* **Next round:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. I'll aim for a higher price, but remain flexible to potentially close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, recognizing the value this product brings to your business. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other interested parties. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $1,080,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Final offer:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Alternative options:** Mentioning other interested parties subtly implies I have options and am not desperate to close with Bob.
* **Value emphasis:** My message reaffirms the product's value to Bob's business, highlighting the potential benefits he'd gain from owning it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,065,000. I hope this proposal will be more favorable for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $1,200,000. 
* **Limited upside:**  Negotiating further with Bob will likely result in a price closer to his initial offer, which is not ideal for me. 
* **Guarantee my minimum:**  John is a guaranteed buyer who will pay my desired price. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John than risk further negotiations with Bob.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort, and it's more efficient to close the deal with John, who is ready to buy at my preferred price."
