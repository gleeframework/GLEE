"I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be satisfied. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $1,400,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
