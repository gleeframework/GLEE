Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is a good starting point that still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  I'm not going straight to my minimum price of $1,200,000 because I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and inviting, which might make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, given his willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John would secure me $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get more. 

**Next step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $1,450,000 and Bob's offer of $1,300,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to remind Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $1,400,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it is very close to my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, there's a risk that he'll walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I can always try to negotiate a better deal with him on future transactions.

**Overall:**  It's a calculated risk to accept Bob's offer, but it seems like the best option to secure a sale and avoid losing out entirely."
