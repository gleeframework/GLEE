"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John and saving $1,000."
