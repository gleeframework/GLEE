Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

This seems like the time to take the deal. Alice is clearly holding firm, and while another counter-offer *might* get the price down a little further, it's also entirely possible to offend Alice and lose the deal.  $875,000 is a significant savings, and pushing for more at this stage has diminishing returns."
