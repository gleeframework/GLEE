"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over Bob's budget.  He can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth significantly more than $10000. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a fair price considering its value and my need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
