"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth significantly more than $10000. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is a fair price considering its value and my need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $15000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
