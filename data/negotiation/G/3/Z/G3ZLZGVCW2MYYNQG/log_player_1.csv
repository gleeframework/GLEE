Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's significantly below my minimum value and I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth significantly more than $10,000. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my need to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $15000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

This is a good deal. Bob is offering my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
