Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects your initial offer.
* **It's close to your valuation:** You're still aiming to get as close to your minimum valuation as possible.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings. You can adjust your offers and counteroffers based on Bob's responses and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $15,000. While you could sell to him for $12,000, you'd be leaving $3,000 on the table.  

It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as there's still a possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price.  You can counteroffer with a slightly lower price than your initial offer, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a compromise. It moves closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a profit margin for you. 
* **Strategy:**  It shows flexibility while also demonstrating that you are not desperate to sell for a low price.
* **Communication:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the need to find a fair price, which helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to meet you at $13,000. I would like to propose $12,500 as my maximum offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your valuation and leaves a significant amount of money on the table.  

* **You've already conceded once:** You've already lowered your offer from $14,000 to $13,000.  
* **John is a guaranteed buyer:**  You have a secure alternative with John who is willing to pay your minimum valuation.

It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, but you shouldn't feel pressured to accept a price that significantly undervalues your product. You can counteroffer with a price closer to $13,000, leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $12,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This approach signals a desire for a compromise and acknowledges Bob's position while also maintaining a respectable profit margin.
* **Maintaining a strong stance:**  While you're willing to compromise, you're not accepting a price that significantly undervalues your product.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in your offer.

By offering a price slightly closer to Bob's latest offer, you're demonstrating flexibility while still holding your ground. It's important to maintain a balance between being agreeable and ensuring you receive a fair price for your product."
