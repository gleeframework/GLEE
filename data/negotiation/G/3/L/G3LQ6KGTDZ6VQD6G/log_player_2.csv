"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $140 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150. While it's tempting to accept, Bob can likely do better by counter-offering.  There's also the option of buying from John, but Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $135 for the product. It's a good price considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is still within Bob's budget and a good deal for him. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal. Accepting this offer is the safest and most sensible option."
