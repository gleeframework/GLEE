"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500,  which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he's already used two rounds of negotiation.  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse deal.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his desired price point."
