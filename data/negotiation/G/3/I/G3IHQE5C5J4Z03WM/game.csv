I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I should consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
