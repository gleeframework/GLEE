Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000. Would you consider $1,262,500?

While we could push for a slightly higher amount, Bob is consistently meeting in the middle and we're already above $1,250,000. Accepting at this point secures a significant profit without risking the deal by pushing Bob too far."
