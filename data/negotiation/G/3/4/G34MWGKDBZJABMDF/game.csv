"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
