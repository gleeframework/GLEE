"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I would like to accommodate your offer, the cost of production and our business margins suggest we cannot go below $90. Would you consider purchasing the product for $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to do $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
