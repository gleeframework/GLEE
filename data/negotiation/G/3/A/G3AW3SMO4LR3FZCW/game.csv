"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,175,000? This would still give you a great deal and ensure I can meet my own financial goals. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000. How about $1,137,500? This is the best I can do, and I hope it's something we can work with.",1137500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,137,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to make one final concession, and I'm willing to accept $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. It's important to me that we find a solution that works for both parties.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000, and I hope you can meet me there. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
