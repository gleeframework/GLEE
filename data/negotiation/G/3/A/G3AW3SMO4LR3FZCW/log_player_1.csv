``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a small discount while still securing a profit for me. It's important to show flexibility but not to undervalue the product immediately.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product for $1,200,000, and this offer leaves room for negotiation if he is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic reduction. I need to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,175,000? This would still give you a great deal and ensure I can meet my own financial goals. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000. How about $1,137,500? This is the best I can do, and I hope it's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,137,500

While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  $1,137,500 is still too far below my minimum price. I need to push back one more time to see if I can reach a more acceptable compromise. If Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,137,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to make one final concession, and I'm willing to accept $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. It's important to me that we find a solution that works for both parties.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm offering a price that's just above my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a clear signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  This final offer allows for a little bit of flexibility and leaves the door open for Bob to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not prepared to go any lower.
