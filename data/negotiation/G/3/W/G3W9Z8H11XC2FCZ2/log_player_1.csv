Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a steal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $160 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming up, but $100 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can go as low as $120, but that's my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $115, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting less from Bob or letting the negotiation drag on."
