"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to negotiate down from my initial offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't come close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum by counter-offering.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is halfway between my minimum value and Bob's last offer, making it a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle, as he has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum value, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer, as we are getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm running out of time and want to ensure I get at least my minimum value.  John is a sure thing, so I'm going to sell to him."
