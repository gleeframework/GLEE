"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This product is truly top-quality and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still not sure if it's worth $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'll offer $100 again. However, I'm willing to throw in an extra $10 as a one-time discount if you're willing to meet me at $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
