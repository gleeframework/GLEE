,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $2,200,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to adjust to find common ground. To move forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand the value you place on this product, $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. I've been very flexible, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's agree on $1,700,000.  This is my absolute best offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're eager to close this deal, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I've been upfront about my limit of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go higher. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
