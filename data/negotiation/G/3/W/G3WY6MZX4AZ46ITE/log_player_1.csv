"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob to make higher counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The difference between your asking price and Bob's perceived value leaves a significant margin for negotiation, allowing you to potentially reach a price that's highly profitable for you.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:**  While aiming for the best price is key, consider the long-term implications of the negotiation on your relationship with Bob. 
* **Alternatives:**  You always have the option to walk away and sell to John, providing you with a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, leaving him no room to move up. Accepting would mean selling significantly below your minimum. While you could take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $2,200,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to adjust to find common ground. To move forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Dropping to $1,900,000 shows flexibility and a desire to make a deal while still keeping the negotiation significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum price.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price reduction as a gesture of goodwill and emphasizing the product's value keeps Bob engaged and potentially avoids anchoring the negotiation too close to his initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer keeps you in a strong negotiating position, leaving room for further concessions if needed while still aiming for a price that's highly beneficial to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I understand the value you place on this product, $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has now repeated his initial offer twice, signaling a potential unwillingness to move higher. 
* **Leverage:** You still have time and the option of selling to John, giving you some leverage.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting and countering again, you test Bob's resolve and see if he's willing to negotiate further. 

**Important:** The next counteroffer should be carefully considered. If Bob doesn't budge significantly, selling to John becomes a more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. I've been very flexible, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's agree on $1,700,000.  This is my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is a significant concession from your previous price, but it's still comfortably above your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's your ""final concession"" and ""best offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're prepared to walk away.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, putting a little pressure on Bob can be beneficial.
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** This offer sets a clear benchmark. If Bob doesn't move closer to your price, it might be time to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're eager to close this deal, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I've been upfront about my limit of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go higher. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is not budging:** Bob has now repeated his offer multiple times and explicitly stated his inability to go higher. 
* **Limited Potential for Further Negotiation:**  With only four rounds remaining and Bob firmly anchored at $1,200,000, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or further drawn-out negotiations. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut your losses with Bob. While there was a chance of a higher price, it's now clear that Bob is unwilling to meet your needs. Selling to John guarantees a strong profit and allows you to move forward."
