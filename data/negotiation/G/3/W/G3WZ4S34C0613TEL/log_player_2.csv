"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is exactly at that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product looks interesting.  I'm really interested in purchasing it, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from the initial offer.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and Bob could end up paying the full $15,000 to John. It's a good compromise to accept Alice's offer."
