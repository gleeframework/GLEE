Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows me to explore if I can push the price higher.  I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,150,000. This price still allows for a substantial return for you, while also ensuring I receive a fair value for my product. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. This is an attempt to compromise and move closer to a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  I've already rejected his previous offers and I'm nearing the middle ground. Accepting this offer would ensure a good profit and prevent further negotiation.  

While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or I might end up with a worse deal.  It's also worth noting that we're already halfway through the rounds.  This is a good deal, and I'm happy to secure it."
