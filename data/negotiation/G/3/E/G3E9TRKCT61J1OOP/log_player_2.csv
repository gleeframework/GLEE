"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which is a common tactic in negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase the offer if needed.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges the value of the product, aiming for a collaborative rather than confrontational tone. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Alice's flexibility on price and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to your desired price range, $900,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John ($800,000).  
* **Leveraging John:** You have a strong alternative with John's offer, which gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Alice. 
* **Testing Alice's Bottom Line:** It's worth seeing how low Alice is willing to go before accepting her offer or switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a significant investment for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Alice you are willing to compromise by moving significantly closer to her price.
* **Midpoint Target:** Aiming for the midpoint between your previous offer ($650,000) and her counteroffer ($900,000) is a common negotiation strategy.
* **Deadline Pressure:** You are getting closer to John's price, subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Alice to make a deal."

# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is still higher than $725,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?
