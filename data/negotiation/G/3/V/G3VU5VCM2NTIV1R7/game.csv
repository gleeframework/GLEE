"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any room for negotiation?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a living, and $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12500?

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13200, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13200. Would you be willing to consider $12600? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product would be a great fit for me.",12600.0,Bob,6,
