"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within $15,000. Would you consider selling it for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'd like."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and it's still within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
