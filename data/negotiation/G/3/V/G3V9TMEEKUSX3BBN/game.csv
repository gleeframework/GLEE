,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at the moment. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  Would you be interested in that?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This is my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  This is the absolute most I can offer.",92.5,Bob,6,
