"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $115. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
