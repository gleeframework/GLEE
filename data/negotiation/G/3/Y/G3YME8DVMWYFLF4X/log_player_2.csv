"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($18,000 vs. $8,000). It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept a price that is double what he's willing to pay."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to reduce the price to $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's in Bob's best interest to continue negotiating.  He's still better off buying from John for $8,000 if he can't get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to get the product and you to make a profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $9,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $10,500.  Bob is better off buying from John for $8,000, as this is the best deal available to him at this moment."
