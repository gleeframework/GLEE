"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to reduce the price to $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to get the product and you to make a profit.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $9,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
