,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit low. How about we settle on $14,500? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",14500.0,Alice,5,
