Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000

While you can potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and ending the negotiation is high. Accepting Alice's offer at $1,380,000 is a good deal, as it's lower than John's price and you're close to your maximum budget."
