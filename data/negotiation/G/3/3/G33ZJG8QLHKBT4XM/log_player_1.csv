Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
