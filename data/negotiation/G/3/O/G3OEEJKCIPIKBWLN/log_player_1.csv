{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $870,000 is close, but to be fair, I can't go any lower than $885,000.  I think that's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and I believe $875,000 is a fair price considering the market value. Let's aim for that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

It's getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing Bob entirely.  Taking the $875,000 is a very good outcome."
