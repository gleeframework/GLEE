"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset worth $1,500,000 to you, and this price reflects its unique qualities. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,350,000? That's a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about $1,550,000?  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close!  I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, anything over $1,500,000 isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,450,000.  That's a very strong offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product from you.  Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
