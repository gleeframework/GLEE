"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, even more so than to others who have contacted me. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I think its worth in achieving your goals makes this a very fair offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is certainly a substantial offer, I feel it undervalues the unique benefits this product brings.  I'm confident it can make an even bigger impact for you than you're currently estimating. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,375,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's benefits, but I still think $1,375,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000, as I mentioned before. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've tried to consider your perspective throughout this negotiation. However, I can't accept less than $1,360,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us given the potential value you'll gain.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,360,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,360,000, so I'll offer $1,335,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1335000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're circling around the same point.  I understand your desire to find the best possible price, but my final offer stands at $1,355,000. This is a very slight concession, but I need to balance value with the time I'm investing in this negotiation.   Please consider this carefully - I'd much rather see this go to you than move on to other potential buyers.",1355000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1,325,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can see the value in closing the deal with me. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to negotiate.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
