**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,300,000 and is unwilling to budge much beyond that.  While the offers are getting closer, the incremental gains are getting smaller each round.  It's very likely we've reached the point of diminishing returns in the negotiation.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed profit. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving us with a potentially lower offer or no deal at all. 

**It's better to take a guaranteed profit now than risk losing a significant amount of potential profit for a relatively small increase in the offer.**"
