"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $15,000, I can afford to be a bit more cautious.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product but I'm not sure I can go that high right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a good price, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to my ideal price. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I don't want to risk losing this opportunity and having to pay John $15,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
