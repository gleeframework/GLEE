"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a decent markup from my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to Bob's valuation of $120, but am willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product for $80, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $85 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's still a profitable sale for me and shows Bob is willing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
