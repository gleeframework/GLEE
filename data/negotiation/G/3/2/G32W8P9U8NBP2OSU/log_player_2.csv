"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,400 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer of $12,500. This is still a decent amount of money for Alice (she values it at $15,000), but it's within Bob's budget and shows he's serious about getting a good deal.  It's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a bit closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate, especially since he has the option to buy from John for $12,000 as a safety net.  There's a good chance Alice might come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still trying to stay within his budget.  There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it's significantly closer to her desired price than Bob's previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,600 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Alice's previous offers.  It's also getting close to Bob's budget, and there's a risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or even increasing her price.  By accepting this offer, Bob can secure the product without overspending too much and avoid the potential of losing the deal."
