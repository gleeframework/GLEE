{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,750,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,400,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000. Selling to John right now would be a sure thing, but I have a feeling I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. $1,400,000 is still a good deal for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000? I'm confident we can close this deal if we both agree to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
