{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, leaving him with some profit to incentivize the purchase.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so our offer needs to be significantly higher than that.

**The offer of $925,000 creates a win-win scenario:**

* **Bob:** Saves $75,000 from his perceived value and avoids missing out.
* **Alice:**  Makes a significant profit, exceeding the guaranteed sale by $125,000."
