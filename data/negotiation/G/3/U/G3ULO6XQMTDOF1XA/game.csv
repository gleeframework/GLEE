"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the potential of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident this product has potential, but I need to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a considerable investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering our current positions. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true potential of this product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  However, to bridge this gap, I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects my strong desire to make this deal work.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to invest a significant amount, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a considerable investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
