Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects its worth while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a deal that works for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $12,000 now is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
