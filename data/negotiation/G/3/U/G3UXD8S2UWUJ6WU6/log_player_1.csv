"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I want to see if Bob will come up a bit more before considering selling to John.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm still above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price that is within reach for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making a final offer at $115. This is only $5 more than my minimum and I think it's a reasonable price considering the negotiations so far.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
