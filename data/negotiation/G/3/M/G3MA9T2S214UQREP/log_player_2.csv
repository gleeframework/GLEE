"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is her highest possible price. It's in your best interest to negotiate down from there. You have a strong alternative option with John at $1,000,000, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price gives you room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your maximum budget and John's offer. This strategy aims to uncover how flexible Alice is on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above your alternative option with John. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I need the price to be a bit more competitive. Would you consider $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000} 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for negotiation and staying below your maximum budget. It aims to test if she's willing to go below $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to land above $1,000,000.  She's unlikely to go much lower.  It's time to signal that you're seriously considering John's offer to encourage her to make a final, best offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is pushing my budget. I'm seriously considering another offer at a significantly lower price. If you can't do better than that, I'll have to go with the other offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Strong Signal:**  You're not outright rejecting her offer, but heavily implying that this is her last chance to make a deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By mentioning a ""significantly lower price,"" you anchor her expectations closer to John's offer without revealing the exact amount.
* **Final Offer:** You're making it clear that your budget is $1,000,000. This might be enough to persuade Alice to accept, knowing she risks losing the sale entirely."
