,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This should be a great deal for both of us.  Let's make it happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
