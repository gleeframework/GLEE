Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting a good return on your investment.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's potential for Bob to counteroffer, leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **It signals your confidence:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, demonstrating the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a decent profit, but you might be able to get closer to your desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter again and potentially secure a price closer to your target. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This should be a great deal for both of us.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close.  What if we settle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures you get your desired profit and avoids further negotiation, which could risk losing the deal entirely. While you might hope for a higher price, it's important to recognize that you've reached a point where continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away."
