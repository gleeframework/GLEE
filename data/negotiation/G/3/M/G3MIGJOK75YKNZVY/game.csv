"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a unique item that's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I'm willing to pay $13500. I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you meet me at that price?,11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $12500? It's still a great price for the product, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500, which would be $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,
