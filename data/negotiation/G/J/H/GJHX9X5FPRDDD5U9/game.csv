,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget to stick to, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to my budget. Would you consider $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets me closer to my goal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I can offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'm happy to pay $95.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, so I can offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,7,
