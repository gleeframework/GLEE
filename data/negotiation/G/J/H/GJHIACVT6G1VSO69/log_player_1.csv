{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for you to negotiate lower if necessary.** You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can continue from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I think I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $13,000?  This would still leave you a good deal, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. How about $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and closer to what I'd like to receive. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
