"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you and the fact that it's worth $1000000 to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm willing to take on the risk of buying it from you.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $875000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $887500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm already making a significant concession.

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not sure if $887500 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $875000, but I'd like to make one more concession from you. I'd be willing to meet you at $882500. That's my final offer.",882500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $882500.
