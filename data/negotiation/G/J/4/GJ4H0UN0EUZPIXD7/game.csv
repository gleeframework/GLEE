"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,500? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  Would you be open to $8,750?  That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $8,875? This is a significant discount on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
