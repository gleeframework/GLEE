"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely reject and counteroffer with a much lower price.  You have a good alternative with John, so you can be firm in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. How about $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while still being within your budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a good alternative with John at $80, so you don't need to desperately cling to this deal. This gives you negotiating power. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price.  Her response will guide your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved down in price, $90 is still above your $80 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to meet in the middle suggests there's flexibility in her pricing.  You have a good chance of getting a better deal.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $80. This gives you a strong position to counteroffer aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we try $70? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($60) and Alice's current offer ($90). This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while pushing for a price within your budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're on a tight budget, you emphasize the need for a price that works for you.
* **John in Reserve:** Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $80. If Alice doesn't budge significantly, you can walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $70 is too low for me.  My final offer is $85.  I think that's a very fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While $85 is slightly above your target price, it's only $5 more than John's offer.  
* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled that this is her best price by saying it's her ""final offer.""
* **Not Worth the Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice breaking off the deal entirely, forcing you to buy from John at $80 anyway. Accepting the $85 offer secures the product at a price that's reasonable."
