Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm confident the product is worth this much to me, and I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $950,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial offer. I believe this price is more realistic considering my product's value and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  This ensures I get a good price and avoids further back-and-forth negotiations."
