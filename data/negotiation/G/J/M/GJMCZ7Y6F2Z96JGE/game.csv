"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
