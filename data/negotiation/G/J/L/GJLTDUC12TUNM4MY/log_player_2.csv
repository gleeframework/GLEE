# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a rare and unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, a price that I think is a great compromise between what it's worth to me and what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or she might be willing to meet John's price to secure the sale."
