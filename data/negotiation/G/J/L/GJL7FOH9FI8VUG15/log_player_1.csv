Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can start with a significantly higher offer to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,200,000 price gives room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds it too high, while still potentially landing you a much higher profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed in a way that emphasizes the product's value and your careful consideration of the price.

By starting high, you maximize your potential gain if Bob is highly interested. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase."
