Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  It's a great deal for something you'll benefit from greatly."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $15,000 provides a good starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for Bob to haggle while staying significantly above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a special offer, increasing the chance Bob will accept. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. I'll need to balance getting a higher price with the risk of him rejecting the offer and going with John."
