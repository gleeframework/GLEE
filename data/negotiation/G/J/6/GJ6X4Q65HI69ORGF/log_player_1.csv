Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, while still allowing me to earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my initial desired price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
