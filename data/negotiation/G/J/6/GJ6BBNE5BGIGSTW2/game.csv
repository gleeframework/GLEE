"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $725,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm encouraged that we're finding some middle ground here.  How about we settle at $890,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $890,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $760,000.  This is a fair offer considering the current market value.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $850,000, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to close this deal with you.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $780,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",780000.0,Bob,8,
