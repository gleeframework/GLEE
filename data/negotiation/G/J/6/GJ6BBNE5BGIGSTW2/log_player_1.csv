Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means waiting for a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $725,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is moving closer to my range, $725,000 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement on his end."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $890,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. I can offer $760,000.  This is a fair offer considering the current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000

Bob's increments are too small; he's still far below my minimum.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to see if he'll make a serious offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider $850,000, but that's my final offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $780,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  He's incrementing in very small amounts, and I've already given a significant discount. It's time to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
