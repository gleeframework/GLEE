"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to what you do, and this is a competitive price.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still allows you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a significant savings compared to my initial asking price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $11,500. I'm confident this product will be highly beneficial for you, and this is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
