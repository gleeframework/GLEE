"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to what you do, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still allows you to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a significant savings compared to my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best option.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $11,500. I'm confident this product will be highly beneficial for you, and this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  $11,500 is still outside his maximum budget, and Alice's declaration that this is her ""final offer"" suggests further negotiation will be difficult.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
