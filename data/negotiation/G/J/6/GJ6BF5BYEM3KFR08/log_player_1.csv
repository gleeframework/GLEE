"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $145 is still within my minimum acceptable price range, giving me room to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's closer than his first offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further.
* **I have room to maneuver.** I have 8 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob or sell to John.  
* **Counteroffering shows I'm serious about getting a better price.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $145 to $140, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell below what the product is worth to me.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasize finding common ground to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More room to negotiate:**  We've only had 4 rounds, leaving me with 6 more rounds to potentially improve the price. 
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing him that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum.  

**Next Round:** I'll propose a counteroffer at $140 again, or possibly slightly higher to see if Bob is truly willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference? $137.50 would be a fair compromise and allows us both to meet our needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $135 and my last offer of $140. This demonstrates a willingness to find a solution.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $137.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasize finding a compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk of Further Reduction:** If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a chance he might try to push the price down even further, potentially below my minimum.

By selling to John, I guarantee a profit and avoid the risk of a lower price from Bob."
