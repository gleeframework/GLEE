,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground here.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference? $137.50 would be a fair compromise and allows us both to meet our needs. Let me know what you think.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",132.0,Bob,6,
