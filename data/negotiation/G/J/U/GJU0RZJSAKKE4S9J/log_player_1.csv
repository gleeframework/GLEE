"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's a bit more than what the product is worth to me. This strategy aims to see if Bob is willing to pay more than it's worth to him, or if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is still a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm running out of time. While it's tempting to continue negotiations, I don't want to risk getting a lower price or wasting time.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price."
