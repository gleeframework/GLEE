Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for me. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept anything below that."
