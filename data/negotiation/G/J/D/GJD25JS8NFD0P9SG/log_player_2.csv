"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. Buying from John at the same price offers the same product for the same price, so there's no benefit to buying from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other options."
