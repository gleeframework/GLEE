{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal, especially considering its worth to someone like you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    * Still lower than John's offer, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob accepts.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, potentially swaying Bob to accept a higher price."
