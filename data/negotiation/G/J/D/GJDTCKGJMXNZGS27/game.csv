"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $16,500. It's the best I can do for now. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair compromise and still allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
