"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,375,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
