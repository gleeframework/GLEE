"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a good deal, but I also want to leave some room for counteroffers to ensure I don't miss out on a potentially good price. I will monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low. While I am eager to close the deal, I am not willing to settle for a price significantly below the product's worth to me. I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. I will counter his offer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,050,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer but represents a significant decrease from my original offer, showing my willingness to compromise. This price is also a good compromise for me, as it's still above my minimum threshold. I hope this will encourage Bob to negotiate further and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  While I am aware that time is running out, I believe there's still room for a better deal.  I am confident that by continuing to negotiate, I can secure a price closer to my target.  I will counter Bob's offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and also the price John is willing to pay. This is a strong signal that I am serious about closing the deal with Bob, but I am not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John in the next round."
