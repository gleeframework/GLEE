Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for $180.  I think you'll find it's a steal at that price."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. How about we set the product price at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $165?"", ""product_price"": 165}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $160 would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $160 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to take a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely."
