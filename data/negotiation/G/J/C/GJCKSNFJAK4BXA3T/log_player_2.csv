"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it brings to you and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's budget. It's worth attempting to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This is a firm offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, at this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and save $200,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price lower than John's offer."
