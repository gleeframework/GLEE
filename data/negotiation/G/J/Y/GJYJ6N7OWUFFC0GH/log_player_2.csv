"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your life. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have other options, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

At this point, Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,500.  It's not worth going another round for a potential $500 in savings.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the most logical decision."
