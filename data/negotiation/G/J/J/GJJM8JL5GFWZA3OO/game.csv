"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $90? That's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still a great deal for you!  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
