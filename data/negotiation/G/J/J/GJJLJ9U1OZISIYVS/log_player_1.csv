Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. While I'm very interested in the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price given the value to me and the opportunity for a quick sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the product's value, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. Accepting $950,000 is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
