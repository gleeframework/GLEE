# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's in my best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, even if it means making multiple counteroffers."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you considerable return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on. If she rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000."
