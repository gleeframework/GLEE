"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. While I'm very interested in the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price given the value to me and the opportunity for a quick sale.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you considerable return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the product's value, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,4,
