Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to continue working towards a deal. However, $812,500 is still significantly below its true value. I can go down to $900,000, which is my final offer.  It's a considerable investment on your part, but I believe the product's potential will make it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price that's too high.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll drop below $800,000, which is John's guaranteed price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the best possible price."
