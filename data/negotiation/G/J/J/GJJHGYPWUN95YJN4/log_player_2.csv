"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? If that works, I'm ready to buy right now."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below both Alice's valuation and our $100 limit.
* **Showing Decisiveness:** By stating ""ready to buy right now,"" we signal that a price closer to our offer might seal the deal quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves space for Alice to counter, potentially finding a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $105 is closer to our limit but still above it. 
* **Negotiating Leverage:** We have time (7 rounds remaining) and the fallback option of buying from John. This gives us leverage to push for a better price.
* **Aiming for Compromise:** We'll continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $95, which would be a good compromise for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair deal, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Our offer of $97 splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($105) and our previous offer ($90). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We reiterate our readiness to buy, subtly encouraging Alice to accept and avoid prolonging the negotiation.
* **Below Limit, Acceptable Value:** $97 is still under our $100 limit while being a reasonable compromise that might be appealing to Alice, especially considering the alternative of a potentially longer negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $97 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches Our Limit:** Alice's offer of $100 perfectly aligns with the maximum we're willing to spend.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** Further negotiation might not yield a lower price, especially since Alice stated this is her lowest offer. We risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice at this price.
* **Equal to John's Offer:**  While we could buy from John for the same price, there's no incentive to switch sellers now. We've invested time in negotiating with Alice, and her product might have some intangible benefits (like faster shipping or better customer service) that John doesn't offer."
