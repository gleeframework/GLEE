"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, this product holds significant value for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,275,000, but that's my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
