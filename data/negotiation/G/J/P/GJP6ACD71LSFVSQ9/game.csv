"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I acknowledge the potential value of the product, I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This takes into account your concerns about the price while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering our previous discussions. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
