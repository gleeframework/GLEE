"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its unique value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Justifying the Price:**  While I don't know Bob's perception of the product's value, I'm framing my offer as ""fair"" to establish a starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $2,000,000 right away. The ""let me know your thoughts"" leaves space for Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I acknowledge the potential value of the product, I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There are still 8 rounds left.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and try to get a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I believe I can do better with Bob. I have a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing negotiations, even if it takes a few more rounds. 

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming for a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This takes into account your concerns about the price while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Seeking a Deal:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a way to ""make this deal work,"" suggesting a commitment to reaching an agreement. 

By offering a more reasonable price and showing flexibility, I aim to move the negotiations closer to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering our previous discussions. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value.
* **Limited Time:** We're already in round 4, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk of further negotiations failing to result in a better price. 
* **No Significant Upward Potential:** While I could try to counteroffer for slightly more, the likelihood of Bob agreeing is low.  He's already shown a willingness to pay my minimum, and further negotiations could stall the deal. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable value, eliminating the risk of losing the deal and needing to sell to John at the same price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures I achieve my minimum target while minimizing the risk of further negotiations falling through."
