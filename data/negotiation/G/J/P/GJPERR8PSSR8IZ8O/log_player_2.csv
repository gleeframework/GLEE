"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **It's a win-win:**  Bob gets a good deal, and Alice gets to sell the product for more than her value.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** Buying from John would cost Bob $1,000,000, which is more than Alice's offer."
