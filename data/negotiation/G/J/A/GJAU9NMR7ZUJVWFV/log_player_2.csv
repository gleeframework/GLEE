"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny to you, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
