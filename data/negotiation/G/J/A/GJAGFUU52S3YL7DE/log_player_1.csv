Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $150 as possible. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and what I think the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price without selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your budget concerns, but I can't go any lower than $120. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer. "", ""product_price"": 120}
