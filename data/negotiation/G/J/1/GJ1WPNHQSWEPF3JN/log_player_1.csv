"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible later.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The message ends by inviting Bob's thoughts, showing willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's flexibility and potential for a deal significantly above his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss.  It's time to steer the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,400,000. This reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Shows you're willing to negotiate and have considered his perspective.
* **Significant Reduction:** The $200,000 drop from your initial price signals flexibility. 
* **Still Above Target:** This offer keeps the price well above your minimum ($1,200,000) and aims to bring Bob closer to a more reasonable range. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the value helps justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and you have the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:** Acknowledge the negotiation is moving forward.
* **Strong but Fair:** This offer is a significant decrease from your previous offer and is only slightly above your absolute minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Continue to reinforce the inherent value of the product.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By now, Bob should realize you have a firm bottom line. This offer may encourage him to make a more serious move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $1,000,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has signaled that $1,000,000 is his ""final offer."" It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Acceptable Profit:** While not ideal, $1,000,000 is still a $200,000 profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. 

It's a good business decision to accept a profitable offer, even if it's slightly below your ideal target."
