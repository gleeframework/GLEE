"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still gives room for further negotiation while staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still aiming to get closer to her perceived value. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $10,000 might be a big jump. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}

We're getting closer. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a reasonable price."
