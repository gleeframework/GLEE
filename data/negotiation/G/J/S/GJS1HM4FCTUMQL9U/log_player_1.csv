Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to that $1,500,000 mark. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes that the price is fair and acknowledges the product's worth to Bob, increasing the chances he'll accept.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still in a great position to sell to John at my desired price."
