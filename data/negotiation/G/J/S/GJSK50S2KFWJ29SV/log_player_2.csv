"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the offer is above her valuation. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price from Alice or get a price closer to your backup option with John."
