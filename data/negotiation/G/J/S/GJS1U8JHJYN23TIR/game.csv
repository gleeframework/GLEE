"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $107.50. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",107.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",105.0,Bob,6,
