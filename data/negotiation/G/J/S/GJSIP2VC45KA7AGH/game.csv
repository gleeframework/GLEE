"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident it's a great price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
