"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to spend no more than $8,000 and Alice is offering $10,000. You can do better.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm really looking to spend no more than $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident it's a great price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your desired $8,000.  You should keep negotiating with Alice, trying to get closer to your target.  If you're not happy with her counteroffer, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
