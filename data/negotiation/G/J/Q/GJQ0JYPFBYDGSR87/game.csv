"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking an interest in my product.  While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $85.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",85.0,Bob,4,
