"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above my maximum value of $12,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now within my budget, and I'm willing to pay $11,250 for the product. It's a good deal considering the product's value to me.  Buying from John would cost me more, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
