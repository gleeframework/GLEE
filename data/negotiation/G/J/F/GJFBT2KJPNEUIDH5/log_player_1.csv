Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering Bob a price that is closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while also maintaining a profit margin."
