"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $16,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality and I believe you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Reason: Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  It's highly unlikely you'll reach an agreement at this price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for this product.  Would that be something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we aim to establish a negotiating range far below Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling our budget limitations.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but direct about our budget constraints.  
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This first counteroffer helps us understand how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reason:** While Alice has moved considerably from her initial price, $11,000 is still above both your $8,000 limit and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we settle around $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not drastically.
* **Staying Below Limits:** The $7,500 offer keeps us below both our $8,000 limit and John's offer, preserving our options.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price point between our last offer and Alice's counter, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a fair offer, I can't let this go for anything less than $9,500. This is already a significant discount on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reason:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your $8,000 maximum. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly further. John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 becomes the more attractive option at this point, ensuring you stay within budget."
