,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for this product.  Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we settle around $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a fair offer, I can't let this go for anything less than $9,500. This is already a significant discount on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
