"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the potential benefits he'll get.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  By starting high and emphasizing value, I hope to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price point that benefits both of us.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves too difficult to deal with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  Rejecting gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price than $9,000.

**Strategy:**

My priority is maximizing my earnings.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John remains a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to recoup a portion of the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a respectable price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage a deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question keeps the dialogue open and invites Bob to respond, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to move closer to my desired price point while maintaining a positive negotiation atmosphere. By being flexible yet firm, I aim to find a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to recoup a portion of the product's value, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Final Counter:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make one final counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and maximize my chances of getting closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to be firm in my counteroffers. I need to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price or risk selling to John for a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $10,750.  This offer is fair, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a compromise before considering selling to John. It's a small step closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a significant profit for me.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer by using the ""split the difference"" approach, appealing to Bob's logic and reason.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm emphasizing finality and urgency, encouraging Bob to accept the offer to avoid potential complications and secure the product.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick resolution.  This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a price that is acceptable to both parties before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. I'm not comfortable with $10,750. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to only 4 rounds left, which is not enough time to potentially secure a better deal.
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer is still $4,250 lower than my minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a significant improvement.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than the potential profit from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob. There's a high probability that we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John is the safest option to secure a significant profit and avoid potential losses."
