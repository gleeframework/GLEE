,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to recoup a portion of the product's value. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to recoup a portion of the product's value, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $10,750.  This offer is fair, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
