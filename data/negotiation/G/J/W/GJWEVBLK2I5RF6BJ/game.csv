"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,600,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price given my valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,100,000 undervalues its potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000? This allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and gets us closer to a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
