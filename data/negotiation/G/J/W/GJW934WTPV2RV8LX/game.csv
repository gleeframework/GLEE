"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
