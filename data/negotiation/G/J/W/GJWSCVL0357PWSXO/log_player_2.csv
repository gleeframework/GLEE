Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $7,200. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice refusing further negotiation. Buying from John for $8,000 ensures you get the product without further hassle."
