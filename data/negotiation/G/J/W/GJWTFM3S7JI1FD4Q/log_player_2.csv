Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it still allows you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a mutually agreeable price.
