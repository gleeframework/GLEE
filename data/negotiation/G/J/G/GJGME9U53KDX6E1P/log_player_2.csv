You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

``` 
Bob should accept the offer. $13,500 is within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
