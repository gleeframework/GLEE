{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects my offer, and I'll always have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a good price, it's still lower than the $14,000 I initially offered. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $14,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
