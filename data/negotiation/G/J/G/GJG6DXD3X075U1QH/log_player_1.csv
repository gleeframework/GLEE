{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to maximize profit. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still close. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down to $155.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $150? That's the maximum I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum valuation for the product.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price."
