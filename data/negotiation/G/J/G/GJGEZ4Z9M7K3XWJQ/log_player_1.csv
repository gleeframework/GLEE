"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts high, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It also leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still exceeding Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while maintaining a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer."
