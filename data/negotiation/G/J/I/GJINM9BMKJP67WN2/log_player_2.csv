Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85 and it's not worth risking missing out on John's offer.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for Bob."
