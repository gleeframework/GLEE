"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000.
