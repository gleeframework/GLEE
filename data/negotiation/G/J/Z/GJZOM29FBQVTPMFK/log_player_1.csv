Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting value, not just price:** The message emphasizes potential benefits to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price without directly comparing it to his perceived value. 
* **Leaving the door open for negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:**  While you have a safety net with John, be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob. If he flat out rejects the offer, you can always gauge his interest with a follow-up before moving on to John."
