"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price for a product that is worth significantly more to me. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair compromise given its value to both of us. This is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000? This would allow you a healthy profit while keeping the price within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal.  Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, we need to finalize the deal now.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
