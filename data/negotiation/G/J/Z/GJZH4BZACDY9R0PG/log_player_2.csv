"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price for a product that is worth significantly more to me. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair compromise given its value to both of us. This is my final offer.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'll try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000? This would allow you a healthy profit while keeping the price within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'm going to try and negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my $1,000,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, we need to finalize the deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has insisted on $1,400,000 as her final offer, and I'm not willing to pay that much. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge further. I've already used several rounds and it's getting risky. 

John's offer of $1,000,000 is my best option at this point. It guarantees me the product at a price within my budget, and I can avoid further haggling."
