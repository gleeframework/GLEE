"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Alice's offer is not the best:** You can potentially get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
