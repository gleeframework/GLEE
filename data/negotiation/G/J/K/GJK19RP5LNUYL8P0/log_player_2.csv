"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $75 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so it's worth seeing if we can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we're starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  $60 is still a reasonable price for us, considering our maximum budget of $120, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like we're being unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $65, which is a good price considering our maximum budget and the fact that we're only 3 rounds into the negotiation.  It's likely Alice won't go much lower, and there's a risk of her getting frustrated and walking away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price."
