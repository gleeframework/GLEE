"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, given its value to you. I know you're a serious buyer, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than the product's value to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the negotiation going.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a fair price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This offers a good value for both of us. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,6,
