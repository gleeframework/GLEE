Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than the product's value to you. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the negotiation going.
