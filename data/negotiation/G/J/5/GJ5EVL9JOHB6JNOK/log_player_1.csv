Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potential budget with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get more for the product, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is too high. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe and reliable choice that guarantees me my minimum price."
