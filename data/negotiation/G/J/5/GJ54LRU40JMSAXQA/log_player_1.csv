Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning the product's worth to Bob, we anchor the price in his mind at a high level. 
* **Create Urgency:**  While not explicit, the message implies that this is a time-sensitive opportunity.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal and avoid resorting to the backup offer from John."
