{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it gives you a significant return on investment and ensures I get a fair price for something I value highly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, as it gives you a profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $1,000,000 is still lower than my minimum, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still provides you with significant value and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a reasonable compromise. This price still gives you a fantastic deal and allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still aiming for $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This offers a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000, this is a good deal.  Bob is offering a price that's above my minimum and we're nearing the end of our negotiations.  It's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
