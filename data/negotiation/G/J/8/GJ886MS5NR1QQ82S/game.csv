"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I've done some research and think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be useful for me, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While I see the value at $11,000, I need to stay closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000, which would be $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
