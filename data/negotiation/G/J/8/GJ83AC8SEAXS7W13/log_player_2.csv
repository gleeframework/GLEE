"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $12,000. I believe this is reflective of its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a terrible starting offer from Alice. It's far above your maximum budget and her product's value to her.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if you're willing to come down significantly.  How about $5,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:**  Starting very low substantially increases the chances of getting a final price closer to your target. Even if Alice rejects this outright, it sets the stage for a lower counter-offer from her.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is courteous but clearly communicates that Alice's initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While $5,000 is a strong opening, it still leaves room to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 maximum if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $5,000 is far too low. This product is incredibly valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice moved significantly, but her offer is still above your $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests she's open to further negotiation. You're likely to get a better price by countering again.
* **John is the Backup:**  While buying from John is an option, you haven't exhausted your negotiation possibilities with Alice yet.  It's too early to settle for your backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Alice's movement helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Firm but Fair:**  You're holding firm below your $8,000 limit but offering a significant increase from your previous offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to bring the negotiation closer to a price you'd be happy to accept, potentially somewhere in the $7,000 - $8,000 range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your interest, but $7,000 is cutting it too close.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $8,500 - that's a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is now very close to your maximum budget, but you can still try to get a slightly better deal. There's no harm in making one more counteroffer.
* **Leverage:** You have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which gives you leverage. Alice doesn't know your exact walk-away point, but she knows you have other options.
* **Potential for Success:** A counteroffer slightly below $8,000 might be enough to convince Alice, especially since she's already shown significant flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to make this work, but $8,500 is a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,800, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By saying ""we have a deal,"" you signal that this is your final offer, encouraging Alice to accept. 
* **Just Below Budget:** This offer is appealingly close to your $8,000 limit, but still leaves you with some savings.
* **Respectful but Firm:** You're acknowledging Alice's efforts while standing your ground on price.

This offer is designed to be attractive enough for Alice to accept while still getting you a great price."
