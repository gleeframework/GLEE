"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my own valuation and the market, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects the potential value while staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the valuation.  While I'm confident in the product's potential to exceed even my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this unique product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm happy to offer $1,500,000, which is a significant amount and represents the highest price I can afford. This allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
