"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This exceptional offer is tailored to recognize your esteemed position in the market and aligns closely with the value you see in the product. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum price of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider a revised offer of $900,000 for our premium product. I believe this price strikes a balance between recognizing the value you place on the product and accommodating your financial considerations. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. You have a few options:

* **Reject and counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate further by making a counteroffer closer to your desired price, perhaps $875,000. 
* **Buy from John:** If you're not confident you can get a better price from Alice, buying from John for $1,200,000 is still within your budget.  However, you'll be paying a significantly higher price.

Since there's still some room for negotiation, rejecting and counteroffering seems like the best option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to accept an offer of $890,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing us to meet. I look forward to your confirmation.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is now within your budget and is a good compromise.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price than her initial offer, saving yourself $50,000. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get much lower. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to pay John's higher price."
