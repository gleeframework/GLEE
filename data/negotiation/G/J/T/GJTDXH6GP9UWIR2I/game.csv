"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $13,500?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,250? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
