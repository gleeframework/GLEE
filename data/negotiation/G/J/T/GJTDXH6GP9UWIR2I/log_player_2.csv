"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher than his desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,250? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Accept the offer:** This will cost him $14,250, which is still a decent savings compared to buying from John.
2. **Reject the offer and continue negotiating:**  There's a risk that Alice will refuse further offers, and Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price. 

Considering the potential for a deadlock and the relatively small difference in price, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice."
