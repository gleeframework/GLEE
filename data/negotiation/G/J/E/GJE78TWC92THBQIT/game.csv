"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide great value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
