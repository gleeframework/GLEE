"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price, making it less likely that Bob will immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1200000 right now. I believe this is a fair starting point given my maximum budget and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding selling to John yet:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it gives us both room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Opportunity for agreement:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Finality:**  I'm using language like ""settle"" and ""finalize"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balance:** This offer is a compromise that allows for a profitable sale while acknowledging Bob's budget."
