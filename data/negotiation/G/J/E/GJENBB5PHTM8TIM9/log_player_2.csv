Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1450000?
