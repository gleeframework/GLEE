"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1200000 right now. I believe this is a fair starting point given my maximum budget and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1600000?  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it gives us both room to work with.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's work together to reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1450000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
