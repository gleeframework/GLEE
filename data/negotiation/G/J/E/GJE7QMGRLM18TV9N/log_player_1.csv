Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a great asset to you. My asking price is $16,000."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** Your product's value to you is your baseline ($15,000). You should aim higher than this.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows room for negotiation. He may try to haggle you down, but you have a cushion to work with.
* **Don't price yourself out:**  While you have John as a backup, aiming too high (like $20,000) is likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer without even considering a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters or seems hesitant. You want to maximize your profit, but also secure the sale."
