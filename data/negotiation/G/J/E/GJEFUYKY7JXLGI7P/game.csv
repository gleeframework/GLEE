"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $17000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $18500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,3,
