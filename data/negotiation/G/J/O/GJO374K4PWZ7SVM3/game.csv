"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is truly worth. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,5,
