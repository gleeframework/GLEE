"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm very interested, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to consider $1000000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me at this point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more mutually beneficial.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $1050000.  This feels like a fair price, considering we're both aiming to make this transaction work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
