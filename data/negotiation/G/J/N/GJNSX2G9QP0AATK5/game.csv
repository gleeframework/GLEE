"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique opportunity to acquire a product that is worth a significant amount to me. I'm starting the price at $1200000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm very interested, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to consider $1000000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more mutually beneficial.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $1050000.  This feels like a fair price, considering we're both aiming to make this transaction work.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1050000 still falls short of what this product is worth to me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This is a fair compromise, and it shows that I'm serious about closing this deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
