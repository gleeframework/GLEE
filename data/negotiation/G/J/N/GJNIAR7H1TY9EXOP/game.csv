"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and hopefully reasonable for you. Let's try to find common ground here.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10750 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the value you place on the product.",11200.0,Alice,5,
