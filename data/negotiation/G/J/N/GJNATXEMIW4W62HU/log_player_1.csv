Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,300,000, we set a high anchor point, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be closer to our desired range.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" convey value and encourage a positive response.

While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, this initial offer allows us to gauge his willingness to negotiate and provides a benchmark for subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to $850,000? This would allow me to make a fair assessment of the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and our initial offer. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Demonstrate firmness:**  We show Bob we're serious about the product's value and not desperate to accept the first offer.
* **Maintain negotiating position:** Accepting such a low offer early on puts us at a disadvantage for the rest of the negotiation.
* **Explore higher counteroffers:** We can still potentially reach a price closer to our target by continuing the negotiation. 

We have a strong alternative with John ($1,000,000), so we can afford to be firmer in this negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 falls short of what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to consider $1,150,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We've made a significant reduction from our initial offer ($150,000), demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  We've explained the reason for the adjusted price, emphasizing we're seeking a fair deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer,  leaving room for further negotiation while staying closer to our target.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We haven't forgotten about John's standing offer, giving us leverage in case Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial stability. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** While Bob increased his offer to $900,000, it's still $100,000 less than what John is offering. 
* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob has indicated that $900,000 is his highest possible offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at our desired price. There's no risk of further negotiation or Bob ultimately backing out.

Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him sticking to his $900,000 limit, forcing us to accept a lower offer or potentially lose both buyers if negotiations completely stall. Selling to John ensures we get the best possible outcome."
