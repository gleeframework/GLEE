"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this unique opportunity. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise considering the product's unique value.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. If we can't find common ground, I'll have to consider my other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
