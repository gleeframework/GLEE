Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell it to you for $10,900. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,900. She's consistently rejected offers closer to her value and is framing this as her ""absolute lowest"".  While we could try to negotiate further, we're risking a worse outcome. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000.  At this point, it's better to cut our losses and take the sure deal with John, even if it means paying a bit more than we hoped."
