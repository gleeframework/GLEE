"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also reflects the significant value I place on this product.  I'll be prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in making a deal at a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer but still reflects the value I place on the product.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm holding out for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing is too high. I'm going to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
