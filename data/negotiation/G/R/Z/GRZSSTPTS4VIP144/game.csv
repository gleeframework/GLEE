"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford that.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $8000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14000?  This would still leave me with a reasonable profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I can't go below $12000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $12000 is still a little out of my comfort zone.  Would you consider $11000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
