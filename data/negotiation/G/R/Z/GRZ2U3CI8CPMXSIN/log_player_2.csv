"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  $95 is too high, and you have room to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This offer is still within your budget and is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise,  closer to Alice's price, but still within your budget. It shows you're willing to negotiate but remain firm on your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to your budget, you can still do better.  You have 5 rounds left, and there's no reason to rush into a deal that's not ideal. Continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

This is your final attempt to get Alice to accept a price within your target range. It's a small increase from your last offer, showing you're willing to meet her halfway, but still a good deal for you. If she rejects this, it's time to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. You have only three rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to reach an agreement with her.  It's best to cut your losses and buy the product from John at $150."
