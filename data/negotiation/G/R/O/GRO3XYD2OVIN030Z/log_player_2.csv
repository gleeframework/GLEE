"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum value ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1380000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,380,000 is still above her minimum value but lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay. This is a good compromise. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $120,000 compared to buying from John. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the potential savings are lower, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases."
