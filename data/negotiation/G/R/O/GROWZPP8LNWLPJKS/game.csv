"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $6,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $6,000 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $5,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",5750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,750. I'm willing to take a small step back and sell it to you for $6,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",6200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $6,200 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident that $5,850 represents a fair deal for both of us. It's closer to my budget, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. Let's bridge the gap and make this happen.",5850.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to take another step back to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",6100.0,Alice,7,
