I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by trying to negotiate further."
