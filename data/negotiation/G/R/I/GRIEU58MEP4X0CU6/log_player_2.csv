{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him.  He's willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $135.  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has to consider the following:

* **Alice's limits:** Alice has stated she's at her minimum price, so further negotiation may be futile.
* **John's offer:**  While John offers a higher price, Bob is now very close to his desired price range with Alice.
* **Time:**  Five rounds remain, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely.

Accepting Alice's offer at $138 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and saves him $12 compared to John's offer. It's also a fair price for Alice, considering her minimum."
