"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $650,000. I believe this price is fair, considering both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at $750,000 saves him $750,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of Alice refusing further counteroffers or Bob losing the product to another buyer."
