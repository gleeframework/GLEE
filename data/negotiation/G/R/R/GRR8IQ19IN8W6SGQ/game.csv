"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $650,000. I believe this price is fair, considering both our perspectives.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",750000.0,Alice,3,
