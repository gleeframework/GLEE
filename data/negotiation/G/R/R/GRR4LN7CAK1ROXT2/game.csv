"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. Considering the value the product brings, I'd like to counteroffer at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
