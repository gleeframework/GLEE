"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive message can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows Bob to counteroffer if he's willing to pay less.  It's important to remember that I can also counter his offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob, so he has room to negotiate.  
* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to go below $80. 
* **Further negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is safe, there's a chance I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a great price for a product worth a lot more to you!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, showing flexibility without dropping my price too much.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($120) strengthens my position. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a little wiggle room for Bob to make a counteroffer, but I'm closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'd like to stick to my original budget. Could you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further gain:** Bob is sticking to his $90 price point, and further negotiation might not yield a higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer, he might walk away, leaving me with the $80 offer from John.
* **Acceptable price:** While not ideal, $90 is above my minimum of $80 and is a decent profit for the product.

It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale. In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice."
