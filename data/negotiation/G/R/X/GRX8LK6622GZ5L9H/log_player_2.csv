"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Let's say $100? What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product is worth $80 to you, her offer of $100 is higher than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product from John for $80.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John is the most financially savvy option."
