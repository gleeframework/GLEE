"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the closest I can get to your offer while still making it worthwhile for me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still seeking to keep my expenses within my set budget. Could we perhaps aim for $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
