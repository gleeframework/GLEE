{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value of $12,000 but allows for some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible while still making a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is the minimum he's willing to pay, it's significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the closest I can get to your offer while still making it worthwhile for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still seeking to keep my expenses within my set budget. Could we perhaps aim for $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my desired value than his previous offer of $8,000. It's also a fair compromise, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
