Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open. I'm also framing it positively, emphasizing the value of the product and creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I am not willing to settle for such a low price. I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but my product is truly exceptional and worth more than $8,200. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is still a fair price considering its value. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll continue the negotiation and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,600 is still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for this exceptional product. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I would like to counter with $8700 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price are slim.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I will choose to sell to John."
