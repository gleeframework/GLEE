"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another offer of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $8200. This is my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
