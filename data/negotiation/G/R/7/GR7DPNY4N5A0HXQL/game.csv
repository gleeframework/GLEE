"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $18,000 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
