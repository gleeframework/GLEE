"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far too high for Bob's budget.  It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts at a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, but still shows a genuine interest in the product.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the low offer (price range) and keeps the negotiation amicable. 
* **Strategic Move:**  It's a strong starting point for negotiation. By starting low, Bob forces Alice to either come down to a more reasonable price or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate is the best course of action.  Bob has a strong incentive to keep trying to get a lower price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $18,000 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressive Negotiation:** Bob continues to negotiate progressively, showing Alice he's willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal.
* **Fairness Argument:** Bob frames the offer as a fair split, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  The message emphasizes Bob's continued interest in the product, making it more likely Alice will consider the offer."
