"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than your offer, but still a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $1,300,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're getting closer to the price I was thinking, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,225,000, which is $1,237,500. This is my next and final offer.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
