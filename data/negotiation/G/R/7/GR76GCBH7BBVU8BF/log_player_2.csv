Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,225,000, which is $1,237,500. This is my next and final offer.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your limit:**  You're very close to your $1,500,000 limit with John.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is negotiating in smaller increments, meaning you're unlikely to save much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk she'll walk away in later rounds, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
