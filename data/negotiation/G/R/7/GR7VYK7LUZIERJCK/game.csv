"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $900,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 feels more fair to me, considering the product's value. This price gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $912,500?  That seems like a win-win to me.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, $912,500 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value. Let's try $920,000. This gives us both a fair deal while staying within a reasonable range. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
