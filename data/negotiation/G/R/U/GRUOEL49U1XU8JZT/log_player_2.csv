I trust you'll appreciate its benefits just as much as we do. Let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to make this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While Alice's product might be great, Bob can get the same product from John for the same price.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
