{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Bob can get a better deal, or at least learn more about Alice's willingness to compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she doesn't want to lose the sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer. 

Buying from John offers a certainty: a fixed price that fits within Bob's budget. It's the most efficient choice, ensuring Bob gets the product while saving money and avoiding further negotiation."
