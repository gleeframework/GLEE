"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good value for you considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and closer to the price Bob was willing to pay in the previous round.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price and the risk of losing the deal with Alice is too high."
