"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her.  There's definitely room for negotiation. Since I have 10 rounds, I'll see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's a good step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a better price. Since I have plenty of rounds left, I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you while also ensuring a great deal for me. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best offer I can make, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at her minimum acceptable price.  This is a good deal for me as it's significantly lower than my alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice could walk away or I could run out of rounds. It's time to secure the deal."
