"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, you can always fall back to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum value for the product. This gives her room to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my maximum price point of $12,000 and within a reasonable range for negotiation.  While I could try to haggle further, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price without risking a lengthy negotiation that might lead to a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
