{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's estimated value ($10,000). It allows for potential negotiation but also ensures I make a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in further discussions. 

This offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as my fallback options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a drastic discount.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. It shows flexibility while remaining profitable.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes compromise and a fair deal, making it more likely Bob will accept. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price point. If he still rejects, I can consider a slightly lower price in the next round, or move on to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  Although it's still a bit below my minimum, accepting it ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing a deal entirely. It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a profit while avoiding the possibility of having to sell to John at a lower price."
