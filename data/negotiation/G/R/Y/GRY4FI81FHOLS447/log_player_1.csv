Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Highlighting the value:** Mentioning the product's true value emphasizes the opportunity for Bob. This can make him more inclined to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  This offer still leaves me with the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is too low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, the offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a backup:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price. I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** $1,000,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing value for both:** I reiterate that the price offers a good value for Bob while highlighting the need for a more favorable price for me. 
* **Showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but also firmly anchored to a price that makes this deal worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a smart financial decision. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing continued willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a considerable loss.
* **Potential for a better offer:** I can still try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer. There's a possibility that Bob might be willing to go a little higher.
* **John remains a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing a good return on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still unable to go lower than $1,000,000. This price represents a significant discount from the true value of the product and is a very fair compromise. I'm confident that this offer will allow you to reap the full benefits of this product while staying within a reasonable budget. Let's finalize this deal and get you on your way to success."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my ground:** I'm maintaining my counteroffer of $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount for Bob but closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob and emphasize that this offer allows him to acquire the product at a discounted price while still achieving his goals.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm aiming to close the deal by presenting a final offer that addresses both our needs and expressing confidence in reaching an agreement. 

By sticking to my counteroffer and emphasizing the value for Bob, I aim to nudge him closer to accepting the deal, while still having the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations fail."
