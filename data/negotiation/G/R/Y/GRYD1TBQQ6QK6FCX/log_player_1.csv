Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true value to me. I'm confident we can come to an agreement, but if you have a different offer in mind, I'm open to hearing it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves room for negotiation and potential for you to earn more.
* **It's a clear signal of your intentions:** You're willing to negotiate but also have a clear bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $1,150,000 to make this work. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,080,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly better offer. Given that John is willing to pay my desired price, selling to John is the best option for maximizing my profit."
