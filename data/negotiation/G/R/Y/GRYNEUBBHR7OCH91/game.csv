"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $1,000,000 is a significant difference from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
