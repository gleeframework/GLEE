Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the current market and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than my minimum and significantly less than my initial ask. I'll aim to negotiate closer to my desired outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the market, the value of this product is truly exceptional and goes beyond typical market fluctuations.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer, how about we consider $1,700,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but after careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still too far below my desired outcome.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate our back and forth here. However, I need to be upfront â€“ while I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I also have other options for selling this product.  To be transparent,  $1,650,000 is the lowest I'm willing to consider at this point."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After reviewing the situation again, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,600,000 is a substantial amount and a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, especially since he's repeated his previous offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away or lowering his offer. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a very good outcome for me."
