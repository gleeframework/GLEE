"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your budget and the value I see in this product.  I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. I'm starting to think about the alternative options, including buying from John for $800,000.",980000.0,Bob,6,
