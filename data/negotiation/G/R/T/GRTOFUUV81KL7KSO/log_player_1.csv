""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob for a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's a price point that's significantly lower than what John is offering, making it enticing for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $11,000 allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating up slightly, potentially getting closer to the $12,000 mark."
