Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $130, and we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $120 from John. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and save $10."
