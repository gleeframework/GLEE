"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price ($1,200,000), so you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price, leaving room for potential compromise.  $800,000 is still a good value for you while giving Alice a clear signal that you're serious about getting a better deal."
