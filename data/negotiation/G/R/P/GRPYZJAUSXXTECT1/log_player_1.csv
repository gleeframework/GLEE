"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $18,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard limit on the price, allowing for some give and take in the negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob has shown interest in the product. I can likely get a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If the negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $16,000.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Mid-point offer:** I'm suggesting a price in the middle of my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and increases the chance of agreement.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fairness of my counteroffer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Good profit:**  This sale will still give me a decent profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will lower his offer or become less interested in the product. 
* **Selling to John is a safe fallback:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is an option, this deal with Bob offers slightly more money.

Given the current round, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision, securing a good price and minimizing potential risks."
