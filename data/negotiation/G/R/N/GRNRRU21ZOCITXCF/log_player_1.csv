Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained firm at $1,225,000 for two rounds, indicating this is likely his upper limit. While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000 is too high. Accepting $1,225,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum."
