Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice is too high. Buying from John guarantees me the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
