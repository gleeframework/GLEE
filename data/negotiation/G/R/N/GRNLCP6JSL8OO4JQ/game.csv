"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer you $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
