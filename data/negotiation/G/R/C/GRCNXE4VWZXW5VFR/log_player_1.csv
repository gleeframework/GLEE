Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to accept. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $100 is a good starting point that allows for several potential counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum value of $120.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While $120 is my desired price, I don't want to lose the opportunity to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  By offering $95, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Creating urgency:**  My message suggests that I'm open to negotiation but implies that this may be my final offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a way to fit within my $80 limit. Could we perhaps aim for $90? I believe it would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistently below minimum:** Bob has repeatedly offered below my minimum value of $120.  
* **Limited negotiation space:**  There's little room for further negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $120.  It's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
