"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $10000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
