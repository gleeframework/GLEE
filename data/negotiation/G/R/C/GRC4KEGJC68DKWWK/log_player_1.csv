Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000. Can we meet in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's coming closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000.  I have 6 rounds left and I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is too low for me. While I have two more rounds, I'm not confident he'll come up to a price that's acceptable. John is offering me my minimum price, and it's time to cut my losses and move on."
