Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $150, meeting your minimum price."
