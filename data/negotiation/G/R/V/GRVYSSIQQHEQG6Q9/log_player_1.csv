Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see the value in the product, but I have to stick to my budget.  Could we meet halfway at $962,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a price that is favorable to both parties. While $962,500 is a good offer, we are still in the early stages of negotiation.  I believe we can push for a slightly higher price before accepting."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you drive a hard bargain! I can see you're serious about this product. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to agree on $990,000. This offer represents a significant discount on its true value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about $976,250?  That's right in between our last two offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $976,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $976,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. $976,250 is a strong offer, exceeding our minimum threshold and providing a significant profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far and potentially losing the deal altogether."
