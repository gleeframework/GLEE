Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $150, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to make at least $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm worried I might lose him if I keep pushing. Accepting his offer is the best option in this round."
