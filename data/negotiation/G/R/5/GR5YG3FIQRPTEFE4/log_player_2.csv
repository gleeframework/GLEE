(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is a significant discount from John's price, there's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling a strong desire to negotiate. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but this initial offer provides a starting point for a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $600,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. While there's always a chance for further negotiation, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiation is high.  Accepting this offer secures a good price while avoiding the uncertainty of further bargaining."
