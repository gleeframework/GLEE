Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly beyond his $11,500 offer.  While we could counter, it's risky to continue negotiating and lose a guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
