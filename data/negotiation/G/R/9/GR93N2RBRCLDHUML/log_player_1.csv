"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  The product is worth more than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm still confident you'll find this a great value."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $8000. How about we try $7800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if he rejects that, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, my minimum price. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great value for a product that's worth that much to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $7500. How about we meet at $7800 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras, like a free service or a discount on a future purchase? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob is offering $7800 again, which is below my minimum, and he's adding in ""extras"" which don't really add much value to me. While he's getting closer, I'm not confident we'll come to an agreement, and I don't want to waste more time. John is offering my minimum price, so I'll take that deal and move on."
