{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for something that can do [mention key benefits relevant to Bob]. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) while staying significantly above your minimum ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, increasing his perceived value and willingness to pay a higher price. 
* **Strong Call to Action:** A direct question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

By setting the initial offer at $9,500, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
