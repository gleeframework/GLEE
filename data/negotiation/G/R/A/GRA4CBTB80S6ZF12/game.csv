"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,500? That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $9,500 is a more reasonable price. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on that.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap just a little further.  How about $10,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make the deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
