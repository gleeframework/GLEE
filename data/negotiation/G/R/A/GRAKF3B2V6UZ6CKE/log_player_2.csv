"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I understand its worth is subjective, I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe you'll find the product to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she claims the product is worth more, that's subjective. It's better to reject her offer and secure the product from John at a price you can afford."
