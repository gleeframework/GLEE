"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a reason to consider the offer and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you showing interest.  While $85 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $90.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $91.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I really want to close this deal.  Let's see if we can make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, and it's likely Bob won't go higher.  I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
