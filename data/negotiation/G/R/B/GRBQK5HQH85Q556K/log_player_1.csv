Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $10,500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10750}
