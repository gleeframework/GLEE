,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is well above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, however, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering $1250000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1250000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer you $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope you'll consider it as a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1100000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1200000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
