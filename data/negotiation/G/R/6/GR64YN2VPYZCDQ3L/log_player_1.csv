Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than what I had in mind.  I'm interested in the product, but closer to $600,000 would be more realistic. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still pretty wide for me.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 is a real stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
