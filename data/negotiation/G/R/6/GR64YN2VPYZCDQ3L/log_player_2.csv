Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  My final offer is $950,000. This is my absolute bottom line.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
