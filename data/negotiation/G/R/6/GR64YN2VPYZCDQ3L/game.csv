"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than what I had in mind.  I'm interested in the product, but closer to $600,000 would be more realistic.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial.  To move forward, I could consider $1,100,000. This takes into account the product's potential while still offering you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still pretty wide for me.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 is a real stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000 even?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  My final offer is $950,000. This is my absolute bottom line.",950000.0,Alice,5,
