"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $7,500. I can offer you a compromise at $8,200, which is a $300 discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,200. How about $7,850?",7850.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,850, but I can also offer you a slight discount from my previous offer of $8,200. How about $8,000? I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free warranty and support. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the extras, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,850, which is the price I offered earlier. I'd like to stick with that price and see if we can finalize the deal.",7850.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're sticking to your price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to throw in some additional extras, such as a free installation and a one-year subscription to our premium support service. I'll also give you a 1% discount on the price. How about $7,820?",7820.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll throw in an additional year of premium support, so you'll get a total of 2 years of support. That's a $500 value, absolutely free.
