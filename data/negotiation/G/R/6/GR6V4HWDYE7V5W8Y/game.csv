"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  It's still a fantastic price considering the value you'll get from this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
