Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  It's still a fantastic price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the value of the product to you. It's likely that if you reject this offer, Alice might push for a price closer to her initial offer of $1,400,000, or you might end up paying the full $1,500,000 from John."
