Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Shared Interest:**  The message highlights mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to engage in a productive negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Plan B:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, giving me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.** While $900,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **I have a better alternative.** John is willing to pay $1,500,000, making him the more profitable option at this point.
* **Negotiation leverage.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push him closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still considerably higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The offer is still well above Bob's perceived value, putting pressure on him to accept or risk losing the product to John.
* **Reiterate value:**  The message highlights the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the justification for a higher price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a professional and positive tone, inviting further discussion and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** $950,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will bridge the gap.
* **Time is money.**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be a waste of time when I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.
* **Minimizing risk.** Selling to John eliminates the uncertainty of negotiating with Bob, who may not be willing to increase his offer further.  

Selling to John guarantees the highest possible profit and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation with Bob that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
