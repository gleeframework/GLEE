Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John,  it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob might not perceive the full $1,300,000 worth. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** We achieve a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  We have room to negotiate down towards $800,000 while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** We can then proceed to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
