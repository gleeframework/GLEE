"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the sale done.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $95.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'd be disappointed to have to walk away from this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $97.50, which is as far as I can stretch my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. How about we meet at $101? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but it's still a great deal for you.",101.0,Alice,7,
