"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the value of the product and presents the price as a reflection of that value.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and opens the door for further negotiation. 

**Why not sell to John immediately?** 

While John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  There's potential for a better deal if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm going to keep negotiating.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better price.  

**Why not sell to John?**

While John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe Bob might be willing to pay more if I push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not rejecting it outright. I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise, making it seem like I'm being flexible and open to reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a fair price that benefits both of us. This helps build trust and encourages Bob to consider accepting.

**Why not sell to John?**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. By keeping the negotiation open, I might be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  This is a good deal for me, and it's likely the best I can do with Bob considering his budget constraints.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I'm risking losing the deal altogether. 

**Why not sell to John?**

Selling to John would get me the same price as Bob's offer. However, there's no guarantee that John is still interested if I reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. It's safer to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
