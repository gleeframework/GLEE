"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You can always buy from John for the same price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is a large discount, which might motivate Alice to come down from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above my ideal price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price. There's still time to negotiate before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price closer to my ideal. I believe this price is reasonable enough to motivate Alice to accept, but still saves me a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably, and her offer is now significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price, and I'm still saving a substantial amount of money.  It's a good deal, and with limited rounds left, it's a smart move to secure the purchase."
