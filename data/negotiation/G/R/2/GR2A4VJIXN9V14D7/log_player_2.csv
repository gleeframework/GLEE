Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  A significant drop from $5,000 to $3,000 is a strong opening move, but still leaves room for further negotiation. This shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial offer.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're determined to get a good price. The $500 increase from your previous offer shows a willingness to compromise but still leaves space for further negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, but the negotiation has stalled.  At this point, you have two options:

1. **Accept and save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means buying the product for $4,200, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000. 
2. **Risk further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee. There's also a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving you to buy from John at a much higher price.

Given the current offer and the potential risks, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible decision."
