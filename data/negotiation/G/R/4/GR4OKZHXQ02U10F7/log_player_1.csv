Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $11,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point acceptable to me, and it's not worth risking losing a guaranteed sale to John."
