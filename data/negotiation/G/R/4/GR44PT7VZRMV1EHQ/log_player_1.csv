Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
