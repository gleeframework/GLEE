"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,250,000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's work together to find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
