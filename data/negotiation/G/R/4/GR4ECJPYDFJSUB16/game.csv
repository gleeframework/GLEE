"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could we work something out closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap.  Would you consider $825,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $825,000, which would be $887,500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",887500.0,Alice,5,
