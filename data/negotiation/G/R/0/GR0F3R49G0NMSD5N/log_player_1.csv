Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows you to reap significant benefits from its use. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, my goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, the message implies I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob shows interest. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential for Bob to value the product more than my minimum, while still securing a significant profit if he declines."
