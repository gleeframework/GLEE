"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I've done my research and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a great compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
