"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $8,000 to him, hoping to incentivize him to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still far from my desired price.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with more rounds.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John is the safest option, but I'm not yet willing to settle for $15,000. I believe I can do better with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for a product worth more than $8,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm lowering my price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not by a huge margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product's value justifies a higher price. 
* **Compromise language:** I'm using phrases like ""find a solution"" to emphasize a collaborative approach.

**Important Note:** I'm still wary of John's offer, but I want to see how far I can push Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not ideal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.
* **More rounds left:** I have 6 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating.
* **Risk assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk and keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to earn more.

**Next Round:** I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable considering his perceived value and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet halfway. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,000? It's a fair price for a valuable product, and it ensures we both walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise approach:**  I'm offering a compromise price that's exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to find common ground.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Mutual satisfaction:**  I'm highlighting the positive outcome for both of us, emphasizing the win-win situation.

**Important Note:** This is a crucial round. It's a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:**  Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high.  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I could end up with a worse price or even have to sell to John.
* **Time is money:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer is a good way to ensure a sale and minimize the time spent negotiating.

**Next Steps:**  I will accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation."
