Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Goal:**  My goal is to maximize my profit.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a price higher than John's offer. There's a chance Bob will reject it. 
* **Reasoning:** I believe Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,200,000 for the product. If I can get him to agree to a price of $1,500,000, I'll make an extra $300,000.
* **Potential Downside:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still get my minimum value from John. 

This is a strategic move based on the limited information I have. I'm trying to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of losing out on a sale to John."
