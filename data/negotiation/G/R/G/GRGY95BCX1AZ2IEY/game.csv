"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fairer reflection of its value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $9,000. Could we perhaps aim for $8,500? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
