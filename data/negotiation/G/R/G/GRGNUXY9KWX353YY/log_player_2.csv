"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth a lot more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's work together and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to your business.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe there's room for further negotiation.  Alice is still holding out for a higher price than her own valuation, indicating she's willing to compromise.  I'll try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,050,000  still doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get much lower.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
