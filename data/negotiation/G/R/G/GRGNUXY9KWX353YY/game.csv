"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth a lot more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's work together and make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to your business.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,050,000  still doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
