{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth a lot more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's work together and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to him. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to your business.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,050,000  still doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
