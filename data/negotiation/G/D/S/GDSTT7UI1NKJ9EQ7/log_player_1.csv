{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that will give me the most potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's getting close, but it's not worth risking losing another round.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, as that's a sure thing and meets my minimum requirements."
