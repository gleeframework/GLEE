"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go a bit lower to avoid losing the sale to John."
