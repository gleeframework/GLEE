Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit. 

**The Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning he makes a profit) but also maximizes your gain. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for you to profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and a ""fair deal.""
* **Price:** $1,150,000 allows Bob to potentially profit by $50,000 if he leverages the product's value to him. This price also nets you a significant $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide your walk-away point in advance.
* **Context:**  This assumes a one-shot negotiation. In reality, factors like your relationship with Bob and potential future deals could influence the strategy."
