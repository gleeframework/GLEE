"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product has value,  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your initial offer. I understand you see the value in the product, but $500,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
