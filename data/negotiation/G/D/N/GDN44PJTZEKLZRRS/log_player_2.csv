"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try negotiating a lower price with Alice, as her offer is still $1,000 more than you'd ideally like to pay. There's a chance she might come down, and it's worth exploring that before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to your ideal range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This way we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. It gets you a $2,500 discount from John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
