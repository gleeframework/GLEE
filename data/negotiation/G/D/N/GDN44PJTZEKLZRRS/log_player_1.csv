Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already starting with a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win.
* **It's a strong opening:**  $14,000 is a significant offer, showing you're serious about selling to Bob.

Keep in mind:  Bob might accept, reject, or counteroffer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. There's still a gap between our desired prices, and I want to explore if I can close it further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This way we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}
