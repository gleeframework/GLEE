"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal now!",9250.0,Alice,5,
