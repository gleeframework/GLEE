"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I can make a decent profit, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly, but if Bob rejects this, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I have several rounds left and I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal now!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
