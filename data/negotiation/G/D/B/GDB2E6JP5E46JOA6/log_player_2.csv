"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal now! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's previous offers, Bob is getting closer to his limit and is only $250 away from being able to buy from John. It's not worth risking the deal with John for a small potential price reduction.  Bob should take the guaranteed $8,000 deal with John."
