,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the cost. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $130 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, which would be $132.50. Can you accept that?",132.5,Bob,6,
