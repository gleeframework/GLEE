"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product holds significant value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price, but you can still try to negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if you can get her closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $760,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. $760,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of $795,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and this offer is only slightly above your alternative option with John. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate further, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you push for more."
