"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. Let's try $1,075,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
