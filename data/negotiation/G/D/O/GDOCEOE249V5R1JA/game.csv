"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. To start, I'm offering $850000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to go up to $950000, which reflects the value I see in the product. This is a fair price considering the potential savings you'll gain by selling sooner rather than later. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $975000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $975000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
