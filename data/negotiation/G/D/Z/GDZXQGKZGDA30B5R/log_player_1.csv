Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and clear in my communication. I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to increase his interest. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a high price:**  Starting high gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open communication:** A friendly tone makes Bob more likely to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Maintain leverage:** By being willing to walk away and sell to John, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to walk away.
* **Open the door for a counter-offer:** I'm hoping Bob will increase his offer in the next round.
* **Potentially secure a better deal:** I'm not willing to settle for $850,000 if I can get closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer. This makes me seem reasonable and keeps Bob engaged.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly pressuring him to increase his offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise point that still allows me to make a good profit.
* **Increase Bob's offer:**  I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility, Bob will be more likely to increase his offer in the next round.
* **Maintain control:**  By not accepting his offer, I'm holding onto my leverage and controlling the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is still less than what I initially hoped for, it's getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, it's a good deal considering:

* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, potentially risking Bob walking away altogether or finding another seller. 
* **John's Offer:**  $875,000 is significantly higher than what John is offering, ensuring I'm still getting a good profit.
* **Compromise:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. Accepting his offer demonstrates flexibility and potentially leads to a smoother future relationship if there are future dealings.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
