"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $105. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",115.0,Alice,5,
