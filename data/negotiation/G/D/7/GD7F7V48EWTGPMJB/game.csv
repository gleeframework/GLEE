"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $150 to me. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 again, or even $126?",126.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation.  I can't go any lower than $128.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather work with you than go with John's offer.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128. Would you be willing to consider a price of $124?",124.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $126. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",126.0,Alice,7,
