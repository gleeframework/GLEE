"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure if $75 is enough. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. This is my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. If you're not willing to meet me at $80, I'm starting to think we're not a good match. I'll hold out for a better offer.",110.0,Alice,7,
