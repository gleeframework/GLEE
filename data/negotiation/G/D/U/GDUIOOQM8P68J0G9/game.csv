,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price given my own valuation and the opportunity to acquire this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while reflecting the value this product holds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
