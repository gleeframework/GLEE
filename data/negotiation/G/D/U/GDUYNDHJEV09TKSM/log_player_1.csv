"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $80, but not so high that Bob is likely to immediately reject it. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I think I can still get a better deal.  He's clearly trying to get the lowest possible price, and I'm not willing to sell for his first offer.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it still leaves some room for negotiation and is above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it's possible that Bob won't budge further.  It's not worth risking further rounds and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $80.  $85 is a decent profit and secures the sale."
