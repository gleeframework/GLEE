"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
