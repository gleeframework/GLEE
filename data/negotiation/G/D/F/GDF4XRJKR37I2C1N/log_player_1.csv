Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encourages a response.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, as indicated by the ""Let me know what you think!""

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** A $1,000,000 sale is significantly better than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  By being open to negotiation, I increase the chances of a deal with Bob.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects, I can still walk away with $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it still falls short of my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can still secure $1,200,000 from John, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000, reflecting the value this product brings. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not completely rejecting Bob's offer, showing flexibility.  
* **Justify the price:** I'm offering a reason for the price, linking it to the product's value to build trust and make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive, aiming to close the deal and avoid a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's price point, suggesting I'm serious about a deal.
* **Leaving room for potential concessions:** I'm still $30,000 above Bob's offer, creating space for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining my position:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
