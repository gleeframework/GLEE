"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $8000 to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.**  You're saving $5,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You don't know the true value of the product to Alice.** While she says it's worth $8,000 to her, it could be worth less. 
* **It's still within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is well below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
