Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13000 at this point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my floor price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
