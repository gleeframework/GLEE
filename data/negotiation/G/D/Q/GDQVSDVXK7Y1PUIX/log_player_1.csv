"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe it's a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I will counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,500. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum price point and hopefully acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not giving up my minimum price just yet. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000, recognizing that Bob might be firm on his pricing.  I'm still above my minimum price and hoping this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum valuation, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price of $12,000.  I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with an even lower offer from Bob."
