"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it looks interesting, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you consider $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $88.50.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $88.50. How about we try $91.25? I think that's a fair price for the product.",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $91.25 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay, but I'm very interested in this product.  How about we split the difference again and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $90. How about we try $91.00? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm still interested in the product, but $91 is a bit more than I can spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $89.50?  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",89.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $89.50. I'm willing to make one last offer: $90.75. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",90.75,Alice,9,
