"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice and she's offering $90, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it looks interesting, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you consider $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $88.50.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $88.50. How about we try $91.25? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject the offer and counter with a slightly lower price.  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice I'm serious about finding a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $91.25 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay, but I'm very interested in this product.  How about we split the difference again and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $90. How about we try $91.00? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $91 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, and I believe I can get a lower price if I continue negotiating. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm still interested in the product, but $91 is a bit more than I can spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $89.50?  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $89.50. I'm willing to make one last offer: $90.75. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a lower price, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Since we're nearing the end of the rounds and buying from John would cost more, accepting this offer is the best choice at this point.  I'm still getting a good deal compared to buying from John, and it's reasonable considering the value of the product to Alice."
