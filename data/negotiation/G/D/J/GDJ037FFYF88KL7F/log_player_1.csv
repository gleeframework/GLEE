Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $85? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
