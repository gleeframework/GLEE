"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $17500?  This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
