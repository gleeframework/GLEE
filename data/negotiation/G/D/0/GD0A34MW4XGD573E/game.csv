"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $11,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
