"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I have John as a backup if Alice won't come down in price significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down a bit, but it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll counter slightly below John's price to incentivize Alice to settle without going too far over my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $11,800? I think that's a very competitive offer and a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer is slightly below my maximum price with John and offers a decent discount from Alice's last offer. It signals that I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $11,800 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my price limit, and it matches what John is offering.  There's no benefit to negotiating further or going with John at this point."
