"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $1,200,000.  This price allows you to make a significant profit while ensuring I receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
