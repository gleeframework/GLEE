"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 to start the negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000. This is a competitive price for a product of this quality.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $19,000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $12,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me as well.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can offer $17,000. I believe this reflects the value of the product while still acknowledging your budget.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see that we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? That's a significant compromise on my end.",14500.0,Bob,6,
