"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $16,000 to start. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is my best offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low for what this product offers.  I could come down to $14,000.  I'm confident you'll see its value at that price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to get closer to my target price for this. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still only able to offer $8,000. It seems we're both stuck at our respective price points. Let's make a final attempt to find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,6,
