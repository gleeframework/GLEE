"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still close enough to consider negotiating further.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $175, or at least $150, before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $160? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $175, it's a fair deal considering the risk of further negotiation.  If I reject this offer, I risk him walking away and forcing me to sell to John for the same price."
