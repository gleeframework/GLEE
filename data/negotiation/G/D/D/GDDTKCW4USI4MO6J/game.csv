"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $160? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller.",150.0,Bob,4,
