Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is still above your $15,000 minimum, so you're not giving away the product for less than you're comfortable with.
* **It sets a positive tone:**  The message emphasizes the value for Bob, creating a more collaborative feel.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still allowing me to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my $15,000 target by making a counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly above $13,000.  This will show him I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a good choice because:

* **It's still above my minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my $15,000 minimum.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's a small step down from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while staying close to my target price. 
* **It remains focused on value:** The message emphasizes fairness and value,  showing I'm committed to a win-win outcome.

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
