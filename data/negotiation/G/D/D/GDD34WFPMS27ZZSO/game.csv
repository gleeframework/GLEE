"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, so I'm offering $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
