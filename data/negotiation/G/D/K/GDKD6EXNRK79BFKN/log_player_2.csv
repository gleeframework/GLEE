Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this item holds a significant importance to me. However, I understand the importance of making transactions mutually beneficial. Considering its true worth and your potential appreciation for it, I propose a purchase price of $11,000. This offer allows us both to benefit while respecting the product's intrinsic value. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you require further discussion.

Bob's best option is to accept Alice's offer. Even though it's more than what Alice values the product at, it's still cheaper than buying from John. This allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
