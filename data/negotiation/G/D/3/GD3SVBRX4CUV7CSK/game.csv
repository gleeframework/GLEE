"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me while still being within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the product's value.  While I'm aiming higher than $850,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product within my budget and you to still get a good price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too much. How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell and me to purchase within my limits.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
