"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $10,500? This would still give you a profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While $11,500 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to meet you at $11,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
