"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not under any immediate pressure to accept a low offer. I'll counter Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's better than going back and forth for more rounds and potentially losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
