"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as it's still a valuable asset for me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $900,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, which would be $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if that works for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
