Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for a fair price.  Let's start with $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation of $800,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and can potentially get a better price.  Selling to John at this point would only bring me $50,000 more than Bob's offer.  

**Next Step:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a price point that is closer to my target while still being appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a fair value for this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum threshold for selling the product. Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the deal without any further negotiation and secures a fair price for the product.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there is no guarantee that I would be able to get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Furthermore, selling to John would give me the same amount, so there is no benefit to pursuing that option."
