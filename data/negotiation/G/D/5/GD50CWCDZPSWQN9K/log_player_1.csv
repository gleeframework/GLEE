{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is above your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by suggesting fairness.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the same as what John is willing to pay,  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can still get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to go above $800,000 for the product. I would like to propose $800,000 as a final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $800,000.  While I'm not happy with that, it's the best I can get from him.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing, I'm going to sell to John.  He's offering the same price, and I don't want to waste any more time."
