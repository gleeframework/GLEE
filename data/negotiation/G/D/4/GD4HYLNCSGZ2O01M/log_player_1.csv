Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $120. I believe it's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering it at $120, you get to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move on to John.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can be more firm in your pricing."
