This offer gives me a chance to earn more than my minimum desired price of $150. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, offering $200 gives me a good balance between maximizing potential profit and not scaring him off entirely."
