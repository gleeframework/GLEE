"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. However, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000 if you decline. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, so I encourage you to consider this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
