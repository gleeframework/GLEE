Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial price is $1,750,000. I'm open to discussion, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's goal is to maximize her earnings. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice has the opportunity to negotiate a higher price in the next round or, if necessary, sell to John for her minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, she's still better off rejecting the offer. 

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice's minimum is $1,500,000. 
* **Selling to John:** Alice can still sell to John for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Alice believes she can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds.

By rejecting, Alice retains the option to sell to John for her desired price or potentially get a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I value our ongoing conversation, and I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I truly believe this product will be a great asset for your business. Let's finalize the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate the value of the product and am willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation has reached a point where Bob's offers are hovering around $1,300,000.  At this stage, there's a high probability that Bob's final offer will be close to this price. Alice is still determined to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.  

Since Alice can secure $1,500,000 by selling to John, it's the most logical decision.  She's not guaranteed to get a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Minimum Price:** Alice's minimum is $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees her the desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of negotiating further with Bob is limited, while the risk of not securing a better price is high.

Therefore, it's best for Alice to sell to John and guarantee her desired profit."
