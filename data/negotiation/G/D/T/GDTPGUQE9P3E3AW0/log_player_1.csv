Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's a good price for Bob, allowing him to get the product at a good value. However, it leaves room for me to potentially negotiate up to a higher price if Bob is interested.  I am confident that if Bob rejects the offer, I can continue to negotiate with him, or alternatively, fall back on John's offer of $12,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than $12,000 from John,  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I will counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $13,500. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise while still getting a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to my ideal price and significantly better than what John is offering.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it."
