"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,300,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Counteroffering is the best option:**  I'll aim to get the price down to a point where it's worthwhile for me and still profitable for Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000.  This would still give you a significant profit and leaves room for us to potentially reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:** $1,200,000 is less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **This is a good deal for me:** While it's not the lowest price possible, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiating further risks losing the deal:** Alice has shown she's willing to meet me halfway. If I reject her offer, she might not be as flexible in the future, and I could end up paying more or even losing out on the product altogether."
