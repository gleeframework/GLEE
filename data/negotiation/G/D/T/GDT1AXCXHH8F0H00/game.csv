"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000.  This would still give you a significant profit and leaves room for us to potentially reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
