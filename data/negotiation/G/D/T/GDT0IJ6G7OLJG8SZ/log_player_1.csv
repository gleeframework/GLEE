Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a good relationship and hopefully a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate you showing interest! I can do $85.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to my ideal price point, but still a bit lower than my initial offer. My message is still friendly and positive, and I'm framing it as a fair compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm also recognizing that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price, and I'd rather secure the sale than continue haggling."
