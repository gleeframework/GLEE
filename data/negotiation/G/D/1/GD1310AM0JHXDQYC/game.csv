"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and meet you at $11,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $10,250. If you're unable to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Bob,6,
