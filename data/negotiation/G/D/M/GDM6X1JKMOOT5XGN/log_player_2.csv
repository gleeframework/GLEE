"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,000,000. This is a unique product with significant value, and I believe you would find it very beneficial. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full amount, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at its full value to her ($1,000,000).  Since you are only willing to spend up to $1,000,000, you are getting no discount. John offers the same price, but there is no risk of Alice taking the offer away from you.  Therefore, buying from John is the safest option in this scenario."
