"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting allows for counter-offers and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying $1,000,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $50,000 compared to John's price."
