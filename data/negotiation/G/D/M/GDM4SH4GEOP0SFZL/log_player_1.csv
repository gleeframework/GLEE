Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my own. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and reflective of the product's value. This can help to build trust and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Openness:** I'm ending the message with a friendly question, encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While it's a good price for Bob, it doesn't meet my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, suggesting he might be willing to compromise further.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, hopefully pushing the price closer to my desired range.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while staying within my desired range.
* **Bridge the Gap:** By proposing $1,150,000, I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our positions, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob is getting. This helps maintain a good rapport and encourages him to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of finality to the message, implying that this is a reasonable compromise."
