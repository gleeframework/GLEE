"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
