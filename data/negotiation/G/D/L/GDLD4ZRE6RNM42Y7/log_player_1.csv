"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I want to try and get a higher price from Bob. $1,300,000 is too low, and I can still get at least $1,200,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
