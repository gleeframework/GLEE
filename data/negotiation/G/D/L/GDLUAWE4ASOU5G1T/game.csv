"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're willing to make a compromise, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
