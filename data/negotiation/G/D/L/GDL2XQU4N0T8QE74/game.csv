"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
