"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $110. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price down closer to his $120 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'd like to pay right now.  How about $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within Bob's $120 limit and is a better deal than John's $120.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm on this price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
