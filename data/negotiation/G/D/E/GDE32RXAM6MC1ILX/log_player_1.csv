Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  This leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary. 
* **Realistic:** It's not an outrageous price, and it's still within the range of a potential win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is a bit closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'd rather not risk getting stuck at a price I'm not happy with.  I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
