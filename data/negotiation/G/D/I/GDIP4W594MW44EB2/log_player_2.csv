"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get the deal done. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Bob has room to negotiate further and could potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference again and meet at $10,875. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above his desired price. Even though Alice claims it's her lowest price, there's always a chance for further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the bargaining process and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $11,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $11,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's my final one. I'll sell the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and Bob has already tried negotiating several times. While $11,750 is not ideal, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. Additionally, with only three rounds left, Bob risks losing the deal altogether if he continues to reject offers. Accepting the offer ensures that Bob secures the product at a reasonable price within the limited rounds."
