"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get the deal done. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference again and meet at $10,875. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $11,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $11,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's my final one. I'll sell the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11750.0,Alice,7,
