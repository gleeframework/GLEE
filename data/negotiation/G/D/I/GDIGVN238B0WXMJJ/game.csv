"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while also providing you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects a compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
