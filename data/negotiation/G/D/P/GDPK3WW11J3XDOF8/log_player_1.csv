Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000, slightly higher than Bob's value. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, and I'm also concerned about the time and effort involved in further negotiation.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer of $12,000, which is a safe and guaranteed deal."
