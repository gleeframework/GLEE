"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
