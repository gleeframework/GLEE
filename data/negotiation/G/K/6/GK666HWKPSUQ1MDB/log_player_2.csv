"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Interest:** We're not completely lowballing Alice, showing her we're serious about the product.
* **Significant Drop:** The $3,000 decrease signals that her initial price was too high for our liking.
* **Leaves Room:** We're still open to some negotiation and haven't anchored ourselves too firmly to $9,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're making progress!  Alice came down $1,000. Let's see if we can get her a bit lower still before accepting."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and land at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Momentum:** We want to keep the negotiation moving and show Alice we're willing to work towards a deal.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach often sits well with both parties and feels reasonable.
* **Still Below Our Limit:** We're a good chunk below John's price, leaving some wiggle room if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold firm above $11,000.  We need to show her we're serious about staying closer to $10,000 or we might be better off with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. $10,500 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're setting a clear boundary while still showing some flexibility by coming up slightly.
* **Introducing Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other options"" (John) subtly implies we're not married to this deal.
* **Last Big Concession:**  This offer shows Alice we're serious but unwilling to budge much more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that you'll find the product valuable and worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go lower. We've been firm, and she's countered with her own ""final offer.""
* **Significant Savings:** $11,000 is still a $4,000 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Time Investment:**  We've put in the effort to negotiate, and further haggling might not yield better results. 

While we didn't get it down to $10,500, accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
