"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1,100,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I think it's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.
