We're still significantly above John's offer. It's time to push back a bit firmer while leaving room for negotiation."

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and we're at a respectable $120,000 profit above John's offer. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing the additional profit by pushing Bob too hard."
