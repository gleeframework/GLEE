Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, your initial price is unfortunately higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for it, given its value to me. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates room for negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step for me. This price reflects the true value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
