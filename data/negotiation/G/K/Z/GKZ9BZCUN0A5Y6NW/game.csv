"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's true value. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
