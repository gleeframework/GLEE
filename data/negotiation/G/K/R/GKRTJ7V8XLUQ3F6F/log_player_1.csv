{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still attempting to maximize my profit.  

Remember, I can always sell to John for $8,000, so this offer is a starting point with a good chance of success."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $7,800? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum.  This keeps the negotiation going and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already established that I'm willing to sell to John for the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it guarantees the desired profit without further risk."
