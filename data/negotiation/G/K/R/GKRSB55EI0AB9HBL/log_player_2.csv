"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and negotiating a lower price is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However,  $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than his maximum budget. This allows for some room for negotiation while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product.  Offering $850,000 gives Alice a better deal than going to John, but also gives Bob room to bargain further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While this is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still within his acceptable range. This shows that he's willing to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is slightly above your offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While this is the closest offer yet, Bob has already tried multiple counteroffers and it seems like further negotiation won't bring the price down to his desired level. To avoid spending more than his budget, Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000."
