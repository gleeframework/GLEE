"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and still allows you to realize significant gains from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the discount. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?
