"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $815000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $790000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. If we can't come to an agreement, I may need to consider other options. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,9,

I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,10,
