# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from on the price.  How about we split the difference again and land at $992,500? That's my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and any further haggling will be in small increments. It's more strategic to take John's offer of $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
