"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move from my initial price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $960,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from on the price.  How about we split the difference again and land at $992,500? That's my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",992500.0,Alice,5,
