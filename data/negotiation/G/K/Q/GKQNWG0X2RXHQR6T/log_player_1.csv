Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. It's important to be confident and show value to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob.  Offering $11,500 shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hopeful he'll see this as a fair solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,200? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum with Bob's offer of $11,200, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than I'm willing to risk for the chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob.  It's better to take the sure thing and move on."
