Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $10,000 because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it still might be attractive to Bob. 

It's important to note that:

* **I don't know Bob's value for the product.** This makes it risky to start too high, but also risky to start too low. 
* **John is a safety net.**  If Bob doesn't bite, I can always sell to John for my minimum. This means I'm willing to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
