"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a good price, but there's a high chance Alice is willing to go lower.  It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's considerably lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will give me some room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still keeping my maximum budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $450,000. This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate. While I could potentially get a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away or me running out of negotiation rounds."
