"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $900,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is significantly below my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to find common ground.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budgetary limitations.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a significant distance from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and propose a price of $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's value while showing my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price and move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
