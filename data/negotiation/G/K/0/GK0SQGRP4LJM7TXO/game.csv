"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $17,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product,  as that's what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still hesitant to go that high. How about $15,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
