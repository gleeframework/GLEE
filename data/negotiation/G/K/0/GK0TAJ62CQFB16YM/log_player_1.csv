Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but still offers him a small ""discount"" compared to what I'll get from John.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and invites Bob to consider the offer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good profit and potentially getting the best possible price from Bob."
