Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your position, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle at $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.
