Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's uniqueness. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a deal closer to $9000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a deal closer to your budget. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
