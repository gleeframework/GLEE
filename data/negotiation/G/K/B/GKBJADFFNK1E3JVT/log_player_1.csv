Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Maximizing Profit:** This offer aims to get as much money as possible from Bob while still being attractive enough to avoid a rejection. 
* **Negotiation Space:** It leaves room for negotiation. Bob still gets a significant value ($200,000) if he buys it, and I'm potentially getting more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $800,000,  this offer doesn't risk losing out on a profitable deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
