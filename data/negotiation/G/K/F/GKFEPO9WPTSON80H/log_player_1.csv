{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a  limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win. 
* **$1,150,000 Price Point:** This price gives Bob a substantial discount while still earning you a significant profit above your guaranteed sale.
* **Sense of Urgency & Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly and value the product more."
