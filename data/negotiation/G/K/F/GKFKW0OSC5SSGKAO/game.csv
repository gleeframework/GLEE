"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering me the product, but $9,500 is a little outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product holds for me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is my final concession for now.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I hope will meet you in the middle.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price. However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my part and a good starting point for us to finally reach an agreement.",8875.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,375. This is my final concession, and I expect it to be a fair price for both of us.",9375.0,Alice,7,
