"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal as the product is worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly more than Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
