# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I can't go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
