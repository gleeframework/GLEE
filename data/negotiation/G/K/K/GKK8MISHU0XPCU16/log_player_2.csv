"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. You should counter-offer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes a lower anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counter-offer leaves ample room for Alice to counter back, and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, it's better to be more direct about what you're willing to pay, rather than slowly inching your way down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, which is a good sign.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $8,500 is closer to her value, it's still above your target price.  There's space to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative:** You still have the option of buying from John for $10,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her current offer ($8,500) and your previous offer ($7,000). 
* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:** By moving closer to her price, you demonstrate that you're serious about making a deal but are still looking for a good price.
* **Psychological Element:** Offering an uneven number like $7,750 can sometimes feel more significant and less like a round number."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $8,250.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, adding weight to her position.
* **Good Price:** $8,250 is a significant saving compared to John's $10,000 price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure a good deal now."
