Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer of $82 is the lowest she's gone so far, and it's still within my budget. While I can keep trying to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated or my time running out. Accepting her offer is the best option to ensure I get the product without exceeding my budget."
