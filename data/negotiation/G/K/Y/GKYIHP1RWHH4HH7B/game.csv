"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
