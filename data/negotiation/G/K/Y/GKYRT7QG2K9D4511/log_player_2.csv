Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a low offer, significantly less than Alice's initial price.  This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to walk away if the price is too high."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount this time. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, so I need to be careful not to overpay. I'm hoping Alice will see that we're almost at a compromise."

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. I've been negotiating for several rounds and haven't been able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether.  It's time to buy from John."
