Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
