Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $925000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum threshold, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't think I can negotiate a higher price with him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and allows me to close the deal quickly."
