Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm being friendly and open to negotiation, which could increase Bob's willingness to compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer, which would keep the negotiation going. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, which could make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While it's closer to my minimum, there's still a bit of wiggle room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I'm still confident I can walk away and sell to John if Bob refuses, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While there's technically room for a counteroffer, it's unlikely I can get a significantly higher price from Bob. He's shown a pattern of offering close to his initial value.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than any offer I'm likely to get from Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price. It's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure a good profit."
