"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum value as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, acknowledging Alice's valuation but pushing for a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is closer to his maximum value than Alice's previous offer, it's still a bit higher than what he wants to pay. He can continue negotiating, hoping to get a lower price or simply buy from John for $10,000."
