Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Ensure Profit:** My minimum acceptable price is $120 (John's offer). Offering at $140 guarantees a profit while still aiming for a higher return."
