Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $80 is definitely closer.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go down to $80, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price."
