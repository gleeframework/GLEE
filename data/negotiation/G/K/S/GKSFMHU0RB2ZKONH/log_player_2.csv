Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. However,  $850,000 still undervalues the full potential of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this.  Would you consider $925,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** Her language (""final offer"", ""other interested buyers"") suggests she's nearing her limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns. We might save a bit more, but we risk Alice accepting another offer or sticking firmly to her price.
* **John is the safe bet:** Buying from John guarantees us the product at our target price, avoiding further negotiation hassle."
