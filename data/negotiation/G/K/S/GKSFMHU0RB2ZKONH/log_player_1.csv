"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if the price comes down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly reinforces the product's worth without being too aggressive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""initial proposal"" and ""starting point"" signals to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest closer to  $700,000. Would you be open to something in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product.  While you want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident you'll recognize. Would you consider $975,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Alice firmly rejects Bob's low offer, making it clear she won't accept a price that far below her target.
* **Highlighting Value:** She reiterates the product's long-term value, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits. 
* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping the price by $125,000 is a significant concession that might encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price closer to the middle ground between their initial positions, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair reflection of the product's value and works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still significantly below your minimum price. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a better deal. 

At this stage, it might also be strategic to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  Consider subtly probing why Bob believes $850,000 is fair. Is there something specific about the product's value to him that you're missing, or is he primarily focused on a low price? 
* **Highlight Opportunity Costs:**  You could gently remind Bob that you have other options and that your time is valuable. This subtly increases the pressure to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. However,  $850,000 still undervalues the full potential of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this.  Would you consider $925,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Alice starts by recognizing Bob's movement towards a compromise, building rapport.
* **Introducing Competition:** Mentioning other buyers subtly increases the pressure on Bob without being confrontational.
* **Justification and Finality:** By calling it her ""final offer"" and directly linking it to her belief in Bob's fit, Alice conveys seriousness and a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategic Concession:** While the price drop is smaller this time, it shows a willingness to move towards a deal if Bob is truly interested. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1.  **Encourage Bob to Counter:** If Bob is truly interested and has some flexibility, he's now more likely to counter with a more serious offer. 
2. **Set a Clear Boundary:**  If Bob isn't willing to meet at a price closer to $925,000, it might be time to walk away and pursue other options."
