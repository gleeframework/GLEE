"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest closer to  $700,000. Would you be open to something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident you'll recognize. Would you consider $975,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair reflection of the product's value and works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. However,  $850,000 still undervalues the full potential of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers. However, I value our discussions and believe you would be a great fit for this.  Would you consider $925,000? This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
