"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher.  How about we settle on $1,030,000? This reflects a degree of compromise while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1030000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'd like to see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
