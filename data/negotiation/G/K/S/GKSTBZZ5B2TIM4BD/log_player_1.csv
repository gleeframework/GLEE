Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference again - I'll offer you $135.  I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can find a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $135 is a good compromise. It avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures I make a profit."
