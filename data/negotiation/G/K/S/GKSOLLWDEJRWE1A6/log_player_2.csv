"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $80. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You know you can get the product from John for $80, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price.  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
