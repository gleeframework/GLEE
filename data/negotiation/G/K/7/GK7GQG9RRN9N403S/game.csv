"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $11,500. I'd like to propose $10,500 as it aligns more closely with my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
