{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good profit. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum he's willing to pay, which is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, which is considerably higher than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation:**  I can try to negotiate with Bob, but it's likely he won't go higher than his initial offer.  

Since I can get a much better price from John, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm stating that I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. This keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Potential:**  This price is still potentially attractive to Bob if he's willing to go a little higher.

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I'm not willing to go lower than $11,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $11,500. I'd like to propose $10,500 as it aligns more closely with my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has raised his offer slightly, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, which is far more profitable.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further. It's likely he'll stay within his budget constraints.

Given the guaranteed sale with John, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. I'll sell to John and secure the higher price."
