Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we want to start higher to explore potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down if he finds it a bit steep. This opens the door for a back-and-forth that could still land us above our minimum.
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message suggests the product's value, justifying the higher-than-minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product at a price that might be appealing if he values it highly."
