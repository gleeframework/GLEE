"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer it to you for $8,250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
