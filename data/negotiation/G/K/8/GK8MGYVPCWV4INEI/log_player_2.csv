"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly more than Alice's value. There's room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for better deal:** You want to try and get the price down further.  
* **No immediate need:** There's no urgency to buy right away, you have 10 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's work towards a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** You've shown Alice that you're serious about getting a better deal, and she's willing to negotiate. There's still room for compromise.
* **Time on your side:** You have several more rounds to explore the best price without risking buying from John at a higher price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for $875,000. This is a fair price that balances your profit and my budget. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement within this range."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's meet in the middle at $885,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident this will be our final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  Alice's offer is only $15,000 above your last counteroffer. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  Alice is likely firm on this price, and continuing to negotiate risks going over 10 rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Value for money:**  While $885,000 is still higher than your initial goal, it's a significant savings compared to buying from John."
