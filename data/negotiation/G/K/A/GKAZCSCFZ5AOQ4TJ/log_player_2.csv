You can definitely do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer again allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

You are now closer to Alice's ideal price. By offering $11,000, you are showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer a lower price, $13,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly lower than what John is offering, and you're close to reaching a deal with Alice.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether."
