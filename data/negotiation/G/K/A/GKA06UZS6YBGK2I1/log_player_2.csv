"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm looking for a quick sale. Given that, I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's wise to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $20,000 was a bit ambitious, I'll admit.  However,  $8,000 is way too low for me. To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating. He can try a counteroffer closer to his maximum budget, or continue to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000? That's a very good price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for the lowest possible price. While Alice's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still $4,000 above his ideal price. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left, and he might be able to push Alice down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
