"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value and potential for your business, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's discuss further!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway and propose a price of $975,000. This would still provide you with a significant value proposition and allows me to ensure a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still seeking to stay within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $960,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
