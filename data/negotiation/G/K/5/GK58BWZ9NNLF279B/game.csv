"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12200 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11800, which is closer to the middle ground we've been discussing.  This is my final offer.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12200. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,7,
