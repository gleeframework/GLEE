# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out a better deal.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John, and it's likely the best I'm going to get from Alice.  I'll accept the offer and secure the product."
