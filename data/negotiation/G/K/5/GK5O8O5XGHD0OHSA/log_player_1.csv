Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price either by countering Bob or selling to John."

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept Bob's offer."
