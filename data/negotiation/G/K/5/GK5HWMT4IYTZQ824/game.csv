"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find the product's value justifies the price. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  It's my absolute limit, but if you're willing to come down, I'm sure we can make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,5,
