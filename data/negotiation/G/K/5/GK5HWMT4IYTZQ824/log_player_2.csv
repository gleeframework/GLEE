Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find the product's value justifies the price. Let me know if you're interested!

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has come down to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's budget, but it is still a bit more than he's willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, he should go with that option.  He's not going to get a better deal from Alice."
