"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150."
