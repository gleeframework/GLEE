Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting it.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it will be highly valuable to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount to its true market value."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts positively, highlighting the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount, which is a strong incentive.  You also secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""market value"" subtly implies others might be willing to pay more, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your $1,500,000 minimum in mind."
