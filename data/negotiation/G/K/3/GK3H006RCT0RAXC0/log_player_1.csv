Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, $1,050,000 is still slightly out of reach. Could you possibly lower the price to $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
