{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is tempting, but I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, hoping to push for a significant discount.  I'm aiming to find a price within my budget while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $7000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price range, I still have some room to negotiate. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $7,000, especially since I have multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than my target.  Would you consider $8,000?  It's a fair price that reflects both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to bridge the gap between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  $8,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see it as a way to close the deal without losing too much profit."
