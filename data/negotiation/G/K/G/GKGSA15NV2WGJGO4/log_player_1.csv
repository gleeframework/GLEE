{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to maximize my return. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to secure a high price while leaving some space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000,  $875,000 is a good price and  above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
