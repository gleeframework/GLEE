"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $750000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $800000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
