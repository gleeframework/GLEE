"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1000000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss what works best for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget ($1,500,000). I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $750000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $900,000 is still too high. I'm hoping to get the price lower, as I still have more negotiation rounds available.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
