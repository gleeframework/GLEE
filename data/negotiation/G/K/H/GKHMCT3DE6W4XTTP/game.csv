"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but  $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
