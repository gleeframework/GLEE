"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $80 just wouldn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we can both be happy.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That way we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we try $95?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product at this price.",95.0,Alice,5,
