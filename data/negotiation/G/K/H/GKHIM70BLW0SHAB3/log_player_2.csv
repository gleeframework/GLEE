# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. You're going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $80 just wouldn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we can both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still a bit over budget, but you're getting closer. You'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That way we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we try $95?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to your budget, you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, it's probably better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $80."
