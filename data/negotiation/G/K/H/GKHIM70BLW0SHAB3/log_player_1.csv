"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still getting a good price. I'm also framing the message positively to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $80 just wouldn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That way we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we try $95?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
