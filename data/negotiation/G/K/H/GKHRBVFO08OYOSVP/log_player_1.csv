"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then explore counteroffers.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, so I'm not under immense pressure to reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this compromise will entice Bob to accept the offer. It's a reasonable compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a margin of profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to rely on John's offer.  $900,000 is a good profit, and it's better than taking the $1,000,000 offer from John.  I'm willing to close the deal with Bob at this price."
