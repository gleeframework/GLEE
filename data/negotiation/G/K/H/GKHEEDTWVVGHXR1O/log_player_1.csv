Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $105 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still lower than your initial ask, it is a reasonable profit and significantly higher than selling to John. Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to result in a higher price."
