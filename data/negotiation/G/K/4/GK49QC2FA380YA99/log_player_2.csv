# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You still have more rounds to work with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit below my target. I can meet you halfway between $12000 and my previous offer of $14000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is tempting, you're still well above your ideal price point.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still fitting into my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has repeatedly rejected your offers, and her latest offer of $14,000 is still higher than your ideal price. With only a few rounds left, the chances of getting her to go lower are slim. It's more efficient to simply buy the product from John for $10,000, guaranteeing you the best possible price and saving time."
