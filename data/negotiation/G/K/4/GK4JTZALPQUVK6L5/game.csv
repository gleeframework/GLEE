"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $950,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
