"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with great potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested and has a good budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $800,000 is my absolute minimum for the product. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a risk of not getting a better offer from Bob and potentially wasting rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to negotiate further, I'd be risking losing time and potentially ending up with the same price from John. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to secure a sale and meet my minimum value requirement."
