"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,250.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and should be more appealing to you than going to John.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you are coming from, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,5,
