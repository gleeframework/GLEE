"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $125? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $115. It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $112.  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",112.0,Bob,6,
