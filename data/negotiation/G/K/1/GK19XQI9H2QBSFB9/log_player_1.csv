Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial capacity.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, we're still aiming to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate him a bit higher, especially since we have the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
