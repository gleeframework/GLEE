Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to go down to $8500 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $8750. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.
