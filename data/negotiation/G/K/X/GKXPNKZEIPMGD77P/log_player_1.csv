Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it can bring to your operations."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that works for me. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I still see potential for a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges both our positions."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $100,000 over John's guaranteed price. It's getting riskier to continue pushing for more, and this is a strong profit. It's time to close the deal."
