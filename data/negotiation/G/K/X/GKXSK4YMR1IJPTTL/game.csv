"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value for me and a considerable saving for you. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to earn a substantial amount for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
