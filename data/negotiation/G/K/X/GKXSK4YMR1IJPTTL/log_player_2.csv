"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value for me and a considerable saving for you. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. I'll try to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to earn a substantial amount for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.  If she rejects that, I'll buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  Even though we've been negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to buy the product from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a good deal."
