Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning ""value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob pushes back.

By starting at $20,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. Even if he negotiates down, Alice has a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than her $15,000 minimum."
