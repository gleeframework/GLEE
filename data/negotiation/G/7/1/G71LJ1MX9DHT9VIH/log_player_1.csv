"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we'll have room to negotiate downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can close a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still holding firm above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is tempting enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering significantly less than my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push him closer to my acceptable price.  Selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his last offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything too far below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering a price significantly below my minimum and we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. To avoid further risk of losing value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000, which guarantees me my minimum and avoids the possibility of a lower offer from Bob."
