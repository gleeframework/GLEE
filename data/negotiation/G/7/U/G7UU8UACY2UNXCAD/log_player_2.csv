"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's essential to start negotiating and try to get the price down. There are still 9 rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. This reflects the value I place on the product and is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  While it's a slight improvement from the previous round, it's still not a viable option for me.  I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower.  There are still 7 rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  which represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option. I have 5 rounds remaining to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product.  Let's make a deal and avoid wasting any more time."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still $2,000 above my budget, and we are down to the last 3 rounds. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  I've already made significant concessions, and Alice doesn't seem willing to budge much further.  Therefore, purchasing the product from John at $8,000 is the most sensible choice, guaranteeing I get the product within my budget and avoid any further delays."
