"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a little, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $110.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I really appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107.50?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
