{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  How about $8,750? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's very close to my minimum price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
