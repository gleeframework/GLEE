Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $90 is higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** It's not so high that Bob immediately rejects it.
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and inviting, starting the negotiation on a positive note.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he's willing to pay closer to your value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If he counters, you can either accept or make a counter-counter offer. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:** You're not giving away too much value in the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While you could accept it and sell, rejecting the offer gives you a better chance of getting closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting, you can:

* **Make a counteroffer:**  You can propose a price closer to your initial $90, or even something in between $70 and $90.
* **Show that you are serious about your value:**  Rejecting Bob's low offer demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell for a low price.

While selling to John for $80 is always an option, you might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $85? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $85 is a midpoint between your previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $70. 
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  The message acknowledges Bob's interest and seeks a compromise.
* **Focus on value:** The message subtly highlights the product's value by suggesting a higher price than Bob's initial offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate but also have a firm understanding of your product's value.
* **Reach a middle ground:**  $85 has a better chance of being accepted than your previous offer.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It encourages Bob to respond and continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $70 might be a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $78 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Make a counteroffer:**  You can counter with a price closer to your $85, or even try a slightly lower price if you believe Bob is serious about his $80 limit.
* **Maintain negotiating power:**  By not accepting a price that is below your preferred range, you show that you are willing to walk away if you don't get a fair deal.

While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer gives you a chance to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $82. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:** $82 is a smaller concession than your previous $85 offer, showing that you're getting closer to your minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and reminds Bob of the good deal he's getting.
* **Express willingness to compromise:**  The message shows that you're open to negotiation but are firm on your minimum.

This strategy aims to:

* **Put pressure on Bob:**  The smaller concession suggests you are close to your limit, prompting him to consider accepting.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $82 is still above your minimum, ensuring you get a better price than selling to John.
* **Show a clear commitment:**  The message signals that you are serious about getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is your minimum acceptable price. However, considering:

* **Time and energy:** The negotiation has gone back and forth, and further rounds may not lead to a better deal.
* **Limited upside:**  It's unlikely Bob will budge significantly higher.
* **Guaranteed sale:** John is guaranteed to buy at $80.

Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a higher price. It ensures a quick and certain sale at your minimum acceptable price."
