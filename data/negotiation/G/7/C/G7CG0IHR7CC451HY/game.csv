"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential this product offers you.  To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment you'll see.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer $825,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
