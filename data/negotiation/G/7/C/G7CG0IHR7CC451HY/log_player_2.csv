"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential this product offers you.  To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer $825,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
