"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle: how about $825,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",825000.0,Alice,3,
