Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle: how about $825,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $775,000 is tempting, it's still higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. At this point, the potential savings from continuing the negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she might not go any lower. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget without further hassle."
