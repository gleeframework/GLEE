"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this reflects its true value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
