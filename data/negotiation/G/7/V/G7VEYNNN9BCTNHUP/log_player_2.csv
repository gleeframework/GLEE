"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price ($1,200,000) and even lower than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  While I agree it's a great product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I want to emphasize that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product for $900,000.
* **Alice is not willing to go lower.**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up buying from John at a higher price.
* **It's a good deal.** While you could potentially get a slightly lower price, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
