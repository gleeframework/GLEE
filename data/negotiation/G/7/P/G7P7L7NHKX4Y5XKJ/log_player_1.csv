Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
