"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
