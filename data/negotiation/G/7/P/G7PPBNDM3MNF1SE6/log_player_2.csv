"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's still room for Alice to lower the price, and Bob can explore that possibility by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at $13,000.** This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than what he'd pay John ($15,000). 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away.**  The risk of losing the product and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice. 
* **It's important to consider the value of the product.** Bob likely needs this product, making the $13,000 price acceptable."
