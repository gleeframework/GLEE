"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price of $14,000. Is this something you're interested in?",14000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $9,000 to make it work. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $10,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more than $9,000, but not quite as high as $11,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",10500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,200? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get this great product from you.",10200.0,Bob,6,,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. Is that a price you're willing to accept?",10000.0,Alice,7,,
