Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more than $9,000, but not quite as high as $11,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?

Round 7
Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** You're getting the product for $2,000 less than Alice's initial offer and $2,000 less than its value to her. 
* **Time:** You've already used 7 rounds of negotiation. While you could try to push further, there's a risk Alice might become less willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to get the price lower might backfire, leaving you with John's $8,000 option, which is only $2,000 cheaper than Alice's current offer."
