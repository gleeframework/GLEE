Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price and well worth the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates the impression of a deal while maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes value and avoids aggressive sales tactics that might push Bob away."
