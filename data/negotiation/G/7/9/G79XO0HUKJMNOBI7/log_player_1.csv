Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $125 attempts to find a middle ground. This price is still a significant profit above my minimum ($150) and a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($100).
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
