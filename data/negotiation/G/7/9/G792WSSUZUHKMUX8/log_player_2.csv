"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for less. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  $12,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time factor:** Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and Bob might lose out on the opportunity to use the product if he delays further. 

It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
