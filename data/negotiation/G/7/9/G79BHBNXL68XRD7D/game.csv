"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we work something closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's worth and allows for a win-win outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and is closer to a compromise.  I'm confident that this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
