Alice's offer:

This price is still fair considering the product's worth and allows for a win-win outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and is closer to a compromise.  I'm confident that this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?
