"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're still interested, let me know!",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,5,,
