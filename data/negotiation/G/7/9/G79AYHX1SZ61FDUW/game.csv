"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer of $80, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'll sell it to you for $95. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
