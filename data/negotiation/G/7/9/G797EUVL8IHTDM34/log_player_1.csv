{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible and engage with Bob, which might encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000?  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
