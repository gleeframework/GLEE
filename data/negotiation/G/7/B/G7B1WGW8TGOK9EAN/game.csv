"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $990,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",990000.0,Alice,5,
