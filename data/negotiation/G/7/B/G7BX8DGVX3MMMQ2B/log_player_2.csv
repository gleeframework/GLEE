"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room for negotiation.  
* **Aiming for the Middle:** My goal is to get the price closer to the midpoint between our valuations ($1,050,000 is roughly halfway between my $1,200,000 limit and her $1,500,000 valuation).
* **Polite and Professional:** I'm keeping the tone respectful to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** Her counteroffer of $1,250,000 suggests she's not willing to go significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **John's offer is better:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is now more appealing. It saves me $50,000 and avoids further negotiation that may not result in a significantly better price.  

While I could try to negotiate Alice down a bit further, the potential savings are likely not worth the risk of losing John's offer."
