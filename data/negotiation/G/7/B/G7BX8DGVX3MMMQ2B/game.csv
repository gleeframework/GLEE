"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my desired range. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
