{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and try to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and even lower than his own valuation. I'm not going to accept that.  I'll try to counteroffer him and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but unfortunately that's too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to my minimum, leaving some room for further negotiation while still making a decent profit.  Hopefully, this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.  To avoid further negotiations and guarantee a sale at a price that meets my minimum, I will choose to sell to John for $100."
