Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $150.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering at $155.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his price point and demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up in his offer to $145, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm confident that John will buy the product at $150, which meets my minimum. It's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob at this point."
