Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point - it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my target of $12,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Although I'm happy to negotiate with Bob, it seems unlikely that he'll go higher than $9,000. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum desired price, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
