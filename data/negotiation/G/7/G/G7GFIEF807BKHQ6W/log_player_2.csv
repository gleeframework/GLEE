"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $14,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He should reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to negotiate aggressively.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's closer to Alice's value while still being within his budget.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's room for more negotiation, and Bob can likely push for a lower price.  He'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $13,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be assertive in negotiations, showing Alice he's serious about getting the product but is still focused on getting the best possible price.  He's raised his offer slightly but is still within his budget and below Alice's original offer. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also pushing for a favorable price."
