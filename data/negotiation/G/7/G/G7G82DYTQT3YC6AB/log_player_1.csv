"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I have room to negotiate and would rather try to close a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate him higher, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me needing to go with John at the same price. It's time to close the deal."
