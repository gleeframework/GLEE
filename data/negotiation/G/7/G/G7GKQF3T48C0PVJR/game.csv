"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think I can do better than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $10,750.  Let's make a deal!",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this deal done, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm at my limit. $10,800, take it or leave it.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not going to give up yet! I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, just like I offered in round 3. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. If not, I'm willing to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
