{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $950,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value this product brings to your business, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to offer the product to you for $875000. This price still reflects a reasonable discount compared to the market value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable for you.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While there's a chance Alice might not come down further, Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to stay within your budget.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continued negotiation could potentially take a lot of time.  

Given that John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most logical choice to simply buy from John. This ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
