{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product ($80) but below your minimum acceptable price ($120). It leaves room for negotiation and is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again and offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to $100,  Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's above his initial offer and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept his offer."
