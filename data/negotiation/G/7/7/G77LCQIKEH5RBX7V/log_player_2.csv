"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I'm interested, $90 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85. How about $87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $87.50 is better than the initial offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being flexible.  $87.50 is still a little more than I was hoping for. I'm willing to go up to $86.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 86} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still not willing to go as low as $86, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. How about $88? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value my product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected a price of $87.50, and Alice is now offering $88.  This is a better price for Bob than John's offer of $100. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject future offers, or Bob might run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer at $88 is the best course of action for Bob, as it secures the product at a price he can afford and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
