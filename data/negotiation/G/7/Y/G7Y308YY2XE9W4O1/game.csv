"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your side.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
