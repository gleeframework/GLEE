"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above Bob's valuation but still allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a win-win situation. By offering a price close to Bob's valuation, I increase the likelihood of a deal while still getting a price above my minimum.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I anticipate Bob might counteroffer. 
* I'm also keeping John in mind. If negotiations with Bob stall, I have a backup option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, so I will use the next round to counteroffer. 
* **Considering John:**  While selling to John for $150 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffering:** I will use the next round to counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain my desired profit margin.
* **Flexibility:** I will continue to evaluate the situation in each round and choose the best option to maximize my profit while considering the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $130, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows compromise and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the deal for both parties, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding middle ground:** I'm trying to find a price point that is attractive to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* **Pushing for closure:** I'm highlighting the benefits of accepting the offer to incentivize Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** I'm still keeping the option of selling to John in mind if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
