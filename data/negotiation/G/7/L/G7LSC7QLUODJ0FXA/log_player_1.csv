"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, he has some incentive to negotiate, but the offer is high enough that he may accept immediately.  

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for potential counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal. Selling to John at this point would guarantee me my minimum price, but I believe I can potentially do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a significant profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway and encourages him to continue negotiating. 

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, as I believe there is still room for a deal. I want to avoid selling to John if possible, as I could potentially get a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it. We've only had 4 rounds, and I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, but I'd rather explore more options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution that benefits both of us, but also leaves room for further negotiation.

I want to avoid selling to John just yet, as I feel there is still a good chance of striking a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to avoid selling to John if possible, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is increasing. 

There's a strong chance that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm worried that if I continue to reject Bob's offers, he might become frustrated and walk away. Therefore, it's safer and more lucrative to sell to John at this point, guaranteeing my minimum price of $1,200,000."
