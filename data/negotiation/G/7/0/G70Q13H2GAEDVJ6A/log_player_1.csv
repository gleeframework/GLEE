"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This can encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:** I aim to secure a deal that's as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price while keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, giving Bob a chance to meet me halfway.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer as a backup gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,400,000.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price, but I'm also  firmly stating my lower limit.  
* **Urgency and closure:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Focus on win-win:** The message emphasizes a positive outcome for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for a possible compromise in the next round if necessary.
*  I'm strategically using the possibility of selling to John as a pressure point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not ideal.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I still have 6 rounds left, giving me the opportunity to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** Having John's offer as a fallback allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without taking a major financial loss.

**Strategy:**

* I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while still staying within my acceptable range. 
* I will continue to emphasize the value of the product for Bob and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's still a little too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Finality:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price, suggesting it's a final offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to close the deal in this round, but if Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds, potentially increasing the price slightly to see if I can get closer to my goal.
* If the deal doesn't materialize with Bob, I'm prepared to sell to John to secure a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your price, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we're very close to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close but not ideal:** $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** We've had 5 rounds, but there are 4 more, giving me space to potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a secure fallback:** I can confidently reject Bob's offer knowing I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.

**Strategy:**

* I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap but also making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* My goal is to either secure a deal closer to my minimum or, if necessary, end the negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However,  $1,325,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer. Let's finalize this at $1,340,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.

* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good rapport and encourage a deal. 

**Strategy:**

* However, I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a win-win outcome."
