,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,400,000.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would give us both a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, it's still a little too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your price, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,325,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we're very close to a deal.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However,  $1,325,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer. Let's finalize this at $1,340,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
