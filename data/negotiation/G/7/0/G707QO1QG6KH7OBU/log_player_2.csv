# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $95 for it.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $95.  You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:

You are still trying to get the product for as low as possible.  $90 is closer to your goal of $85.  Counteroffer again."
