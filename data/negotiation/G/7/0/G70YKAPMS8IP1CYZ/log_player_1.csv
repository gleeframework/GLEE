Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,800,000 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,200,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is a better outcome than continuing with Bob."
