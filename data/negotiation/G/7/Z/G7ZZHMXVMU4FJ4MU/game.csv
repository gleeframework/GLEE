"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I still think it's a bit high.  Could you do $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already dropped the price by $100,000 from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we've both moved a bit on price.  To be fair to you, I can go up slightly. Would you be willing to settle at $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $802,500. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",802500.0,Alice,7,
