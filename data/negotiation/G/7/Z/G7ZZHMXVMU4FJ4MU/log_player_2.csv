# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already dropped the price by $100,000 from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we've both moved a bit on price.  To be fair to you, I can go up slightly. Would you be willing to settle at $780,000?"", ""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $802,500. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $802,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $802,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $800,000 mark. While we might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of the negotiation, it's unlikely to be a significant difference at this point. Accepting the $802,500 offer secures a good deal for us, well below John's price."
