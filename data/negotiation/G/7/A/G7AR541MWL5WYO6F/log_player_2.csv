{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  $500,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how low she's willing to go.  It's unlikely she'll accept this right away, but it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at a point where I'd accept.  There's room to negotiate further.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Alice, but if not, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $450,000 is closer to my target, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and reach a price closer to $350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again to $400,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer. It's a reasonable compromise that might persuade her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice seems to be stuck at $500,000. We've already been here before, and I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can budge her closer to my target price.  I still have some rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm still interested in buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that this small increase will be enough to convince her to accept the offer. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my initial target of $500,000. We're running out of rounds, and the negotiation seems to be going nowhere. I'm no longer confident that I can get a better price than what John is offering, so I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
