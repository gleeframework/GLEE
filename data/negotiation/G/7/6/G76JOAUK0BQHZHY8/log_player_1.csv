Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's worth seeing if I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to drop my price that much.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit than risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price."
