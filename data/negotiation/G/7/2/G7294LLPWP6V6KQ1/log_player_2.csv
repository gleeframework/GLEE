Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but no lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I know you're considering John's offer, but I believe you'll find this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. If you're still not satisfied, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While $1,050,000 is a good price, it's still a bit more than what I can get from John. I'm going to go with John's offer to save the extra $50,000."
