"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

* **Openness:**  Bob emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still some room to negotiate.  Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.
* **Avoiding hasty decision:**  Accepting now might leave Bob with buyer's remorse if he believes he could have gotten a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:**  Seeing Alice's response to a counteroffer will give Bob a better sense of her flexibility and how far he can push the negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a significant step forward from my previous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value I'll gain from using it. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to move but still pushing for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the value you see in the product and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Target:**  Alice's offer of $825,000 is very close to Bob's desired price point, especially considering he's already negotiated significantly from the initial offer.
* **Risk of Going Too Low:**  Pressing for a lower price could risk Alice walking away from the deal, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a deal with a good price rather than risking a stalemate."
