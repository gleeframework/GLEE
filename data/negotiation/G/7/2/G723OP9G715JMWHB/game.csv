"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
