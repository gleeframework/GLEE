"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a fair price considering its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation strategy to start with an offer significantly lower than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for keeping the communication open and productive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $1,000,000, I am signaling that I am serious about buying but also indicating that I am willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  Alice has signaled that $1,000,000 is too low. By counteroffering with $1,150,000, I am demonstrating willingness to negotiate upwards but in a measured way.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** Suggesting a price directly in the middle of our current positions is a common negotiation tactic and can sometimes help break a stalemate.
* **Maintaining a Deadline:**  I need to keep in mind that John offers a guaranteed price of $1,500,000. While I want to get the best deal from Alice, I don't want to drag out negotiations to the point where I risk losing both options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer for that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Final Offer:**  Alice has stated that $1,250,000 is her final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and limits our negotiation flexibility.
* **Close to My Limit:** While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $1,250,000 is already a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to get Alice even lower might backfire. She could stand firm, and I'd have to settle for John's higher price. It's not worth the risk of losing a good deal at this point."
