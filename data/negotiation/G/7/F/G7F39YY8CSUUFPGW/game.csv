"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects my current budget and the value I see in this item. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product and our negotiation process. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
