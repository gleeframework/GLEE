Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. It's always better to try and negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price still offers you a good deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but you still have room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a little bit lower before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it allows me to achieve my desired profit margin.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price, and you have no more room to negotiate. There's no point in rejecting and potentially risking the deal, as John offers the same price.  You might as well accept and move on."
