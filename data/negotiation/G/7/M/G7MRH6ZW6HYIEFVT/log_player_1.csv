Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. It's important to be firm in my negotiations and not settle too quickly. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
