Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe we can still squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation. I'll counteroffer once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer before accepting John's offer.  $1,450,000 is still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant step closer to my minimum.  Hopefully, this is enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum desired price.  At this point, I'm willing to accept John's offer to ensure I receive at least my minimum.  Further negotiation with Bob may not yield a better result."
