"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,050,000 is above your target of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and Alice is motivated to sell. By rejecting, you can start pushing for a lower price. 
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing John's price gives you leverage. If you can't get a better deal from Alice, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer starts with a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your commitment to saving money.  
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $950,000 is still above John's offer, so there's potential for Alice to meet you halfway.
* **Sets the tone for a strong negotiation:**  This demonstrates your willingness to push for a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has met your target price:** $1,000,000 is your maximum acceptable price, and Alice has agreed to it. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee of success, and you risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is a factor:** With 10 rounds, you don't want to waste time if a good deal is already available.

By accepting, you get the product for your desired price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
