,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's as low as I'm comfortable going, and I'm really interested in the product.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth it.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $109 and $100, which would be $104.50. Can you consider this offer?",104.5,Bob,6,
