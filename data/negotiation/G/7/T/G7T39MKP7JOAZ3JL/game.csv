"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true worth of this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also reflecting my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $875,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  Would you consider $890,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",890000.0,Alice,5,
