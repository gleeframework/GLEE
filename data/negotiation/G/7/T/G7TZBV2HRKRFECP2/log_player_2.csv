"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$60 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This should encourage her to consider a lower price, while also showing I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price from her initial offer.  $55 is a reasonable price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy it from Alice.  It's significantly less than John's price, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in future rounds."
