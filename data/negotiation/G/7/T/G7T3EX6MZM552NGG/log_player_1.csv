Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing the negotiation to progress.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product for a price higher than my minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter again.
* **Negotiation Stalls:**  If I feel the negotiation is going nowhere, I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, I'm willing to continue negotiating with him. There's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range (likely above $15,000).  I'll need to consider Bob's willingness to pay, my own needs, and the risk of him walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise, coming down from my initial price but staying above my minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm again emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's self-interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a price above my minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide on my next move (accept, reject, or counter). 
* **Negotiation Stalls:**  If I feel the negotiation isn't progressing, I'll  sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer but $16,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be open to $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  While I'm not willing to accept his offer, I believe there's still room for compromise. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum, but I'm motivated to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range (likely between $14,000 and $15,000). I'll need to weigh Bob's willingness to pay against my own needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer ($16,000) and Bob's last offer ($13,500).
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""closer to agreement"" to encourage Bob to see this as a positive step.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a price closer to my minimum but still above my desired range.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide on my next move: accept, reject, or counter.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might be left with only John's offer of $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:**  I'll accept Bob's offer, securing a price that's close to my minimum and avoiding the risk of losing the deal."
