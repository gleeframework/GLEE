"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and still a good profit margin for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is a discount from her perceived value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price of $800,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase the product from John at a much lower price."
