# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still a significant difference from his target price. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $10,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $9500. I'll sell the product to you for $9750. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,750 is still above his budget. With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will budge much further. At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000, saving himself $1,750."
