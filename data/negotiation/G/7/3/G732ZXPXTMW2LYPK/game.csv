"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
