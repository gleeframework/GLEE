"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a purchase while still giving you a healthy profit. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value and future potential that justifies a higher price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 remains too high for me. Considering the potential I see in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant step toward your position, demonstrating my genuine interest. I believe this offer reflects a fair price for both parties, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
