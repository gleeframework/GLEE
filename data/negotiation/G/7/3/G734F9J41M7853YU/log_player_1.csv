"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation given the return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" and focusing on the ""return on investment,"" I'm framing the price as justified by future gains, not just the current state of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language (""starting point"") clearly indicates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a purchase while still giving you a healthy profit.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss.  I'll use the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value and future potential that justifies a higher price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and his perspective on value to show I'm engaged in the negotiation. However, I'm clearly stating it's not acceptable.
* **Significant Drop, Strategic Positioning:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer ($150,000) to signal flexibility and willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm re-emphasizing the ""intrinsic value"" and ""future potential"" to justify the higher price in a way that connects to Bob's potential gains.
* **Framing as Compromise:**  By explicitly stating this is a ""significant compromise,"" I'm putting subtle pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 remains too high for me. Considering the potential I see in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant step toward your position, demonstrating my genuine interest. I believe this offer reflects a fair price for both parties, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate upwards, but there's no guarantee he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now rather than dragging it out further has its advantages. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
 
Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
