Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still a bit too high.  At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:** He could try to push Alice down further, but there's no guarantee she'll budge.
2. **Buy from John:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, which is within Bob's budget and saves him money compared to continuing to negotiate.

Since Bob's goal is to save money, the safest option is to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
