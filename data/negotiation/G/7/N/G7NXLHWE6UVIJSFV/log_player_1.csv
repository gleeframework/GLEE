Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,200,000) while ensuring the sale.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers (John), I incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While my first offer is strong, there's a slight possibility Bob might negotiate, pushing the price closer to his maximum. 

This strategy aims for a significant profit while keeping the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
