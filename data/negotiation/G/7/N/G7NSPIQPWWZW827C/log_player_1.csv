{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting a good price for the product, but you're open to negotiating.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows the negotiation to flow and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,900. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. It's better to sell to John at this point and ensure I get my minimum value."
