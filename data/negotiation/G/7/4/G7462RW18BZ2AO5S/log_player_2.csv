"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $11,500 for this exceptional item. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product, I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. I believe this price reflects the quality of the product while also giving you a reasonable discount. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with an offer of $10,900. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable discount. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $10,900 is very close to Bob's desired price point of $10,500. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and then Bob would have to buy from John at $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and ending up with a worse outcome."
