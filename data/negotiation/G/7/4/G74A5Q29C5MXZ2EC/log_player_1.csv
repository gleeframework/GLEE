"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see what his counteroffer will be in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to be more appealing to Bob, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is now above my minimum and closer to my desired price. There's a risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer, and we're already at round 4.  It's safer to accept and secure the sale now."
