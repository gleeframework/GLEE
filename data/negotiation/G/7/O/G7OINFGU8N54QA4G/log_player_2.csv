"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,450,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and a great opportunity for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price still allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount while giving me a fair return on my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is simply not a feasible number for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which is a significant concession on my end. This price represents a fair compromise and allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount. Let's make this deal happen.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,210,000 is a good offer, I'm still needing a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,230,000. This represents a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,200,000 and we are getting close to our walk-away point. Taking the sure thing with John makes the most sense now."
