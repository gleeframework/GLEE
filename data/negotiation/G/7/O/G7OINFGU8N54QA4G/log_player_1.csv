Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,450,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and a great opportunity for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take his $1,100,000, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price still allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount while giving me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000?  That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's closer, but I'm not willing to go that low.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is simply not a feasible number for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which is a significant concession on my end. This price represents a fair compromise and allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Would you be open to $1,210,000? I'm trying to make this work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,210,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,250,000 at this point.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,210,000 is a good offer, I'm still needing a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,230,000. This represents a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1230000}
