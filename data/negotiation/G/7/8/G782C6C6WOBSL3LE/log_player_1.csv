{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $9,500, it's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

However, remember that this is just a starting point. Depending on how the negotiation goes, you may need to adjust your offer or even move on to John if Bob proves unwilling to pay your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John, so it's worth trying to push for a higher price with Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little higher than my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is proving to be inflexible, and it's unlikely he'll go higher than $8,500. You've already made a concession, and you're within $1,500 of your target price with John.  It's time to take the secure deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
