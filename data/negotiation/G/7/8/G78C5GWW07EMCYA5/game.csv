"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still outside of my budget.  How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute top of my budget.  I can offer you that, but I completely understand if it doesn't work for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
