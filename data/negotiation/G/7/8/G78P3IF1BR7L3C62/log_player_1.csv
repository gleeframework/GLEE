Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1,150,000 at this time. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
