"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
