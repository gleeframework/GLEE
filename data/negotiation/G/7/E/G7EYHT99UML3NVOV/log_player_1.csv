Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. I'm also keeping in mind the minimum value I want to receive for the product ($12,000), and John's offer as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer, as Bob clearly sees value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a higher price. I'm also factoring in the possibility of a final negotiation round, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000, as that's a significant discount compared to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I've already shown flexibility, and with John's offer as a safety net, I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer, but still slightly higher. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to settle for less than what I believe is a fair price. I'm also factoring in the possibility of Bob rejecting this offer, but I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  With John offering $12,000, it's clear that continuing to negotiate with Bob is not in my best interest. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
