"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $115, which is a great price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $115 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to propose a lower price, or you can buy from John for $120."
