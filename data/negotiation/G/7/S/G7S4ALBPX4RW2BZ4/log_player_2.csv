"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,400,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you, and it allows us both to make a great deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her starting point is already above that. It's in your best interest to counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 just doesn't quite cut it for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal. You can save $150,000 compared to buying from John. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially driving the price up. It's best to secure this deal at a price that's favorable to you."
