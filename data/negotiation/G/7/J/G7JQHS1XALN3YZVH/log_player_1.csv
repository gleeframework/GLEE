"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher sale price. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with his counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I hope it will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price. I believe this counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm aware that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation process, I'm still not willing to accept such a low price.  I will try to counteroffer once more, but if that fails, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and need to ensure I secure a profitable sale. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
