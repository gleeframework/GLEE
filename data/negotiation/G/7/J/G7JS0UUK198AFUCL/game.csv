"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $950,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product, which represents a fair compromise between our positions.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
