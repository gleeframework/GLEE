Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return on investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a significant difference from John's offer.  I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to my target before accepting her offer or going with John."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have another option at $1,000,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal with you today."",

Here's the strategy:

* **Reveal your alternative:** By mentioning John's offer, I introduce a sense of urgency and competition for Alice. 
* **Stay firm but fair:**  $950,000 is a strong counter-offer. It shows I'm serious about buying but not willing to overpay. 
* **Call to action:**  By expressing my readiness to ""close the deal today,"" I'm encouraging Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $950,000 is still significantly below its true value. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is unlikely to go any lower. While $1,050,000 isn't a bad price, I have a guaranteed option for $1,000,000 with John. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
