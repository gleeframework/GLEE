"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However,  $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",8500.0,Alice,5,
