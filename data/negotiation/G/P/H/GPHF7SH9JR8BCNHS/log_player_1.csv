{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is much higher. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,250,000 is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to establish a sense of urgency and value by highlighting the product's worth to me. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible while keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can try to push for a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my position and highlighting the value he'll be getting. I'm also using a positive tone to maintain a collaborative feel. 
* **Strategy:** My goal is to find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can offer $950,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is an improvement, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I need to try and bridge the gap further or consider selling to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,025,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value he'd still be getting. I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage a deal.
* **Strategy:** My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, bridging the gap further while remaining within my acceptable range. If this offer is rejected, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $975,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though I've been willing to negotiate, there's a clear limit to how much I can compromise.

At this point, further negotiation with Bob doesn't seem productive. I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's so far below my product's value. It's more beneficial for me to sell to John for the full price of $1,500,000."
