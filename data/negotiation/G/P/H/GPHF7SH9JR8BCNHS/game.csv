"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
