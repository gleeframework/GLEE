"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,250,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
