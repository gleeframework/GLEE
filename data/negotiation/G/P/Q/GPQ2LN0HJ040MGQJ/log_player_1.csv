Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $130, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, giving us a good margin to work with.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. By aiming for $130, we're closer to his maximum valuation while still maintaining a significant profit above our minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't be left with a loss if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging we have a backup option if needed."
