"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to save as much as possible.  $1,000,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for further negotiation.  Alice is likely to counter, but this establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still possible to negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and it's likely Alice will continue to counter-offer. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and increases the chances of reaching a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best deal.  $1,025,000 is a halfway point between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to save as much as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,030,000, which is very close to Bob's last offer of $1,025,000.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only yield a small difference in price.  With 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept this offer and secure the purchase."
