"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual market value. How about we settle around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $12,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
