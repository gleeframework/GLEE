"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product holds. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the $1,400,000 mark. My next counteroffer is $1,320,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
