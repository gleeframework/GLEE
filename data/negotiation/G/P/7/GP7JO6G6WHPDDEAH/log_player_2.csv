``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. While the product is valuable, Bob can likely get it cheaper through negotiation or by buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $825,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price or going with John for a guaranteed price of $800,000."
