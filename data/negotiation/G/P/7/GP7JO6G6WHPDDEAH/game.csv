"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $850,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering $800,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable paying that price or simply buying it from John.",800000.0,Bob,4,
