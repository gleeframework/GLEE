Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation downward.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $175, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, we've maximized our profit. If he rejects, we can always come down a little, knowing John provides a safety net at $150. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses language that emphasizes the value of the product without explicitly stating a number, which can be helpful in negotiations."
