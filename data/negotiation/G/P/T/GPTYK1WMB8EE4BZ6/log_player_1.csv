{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He needs to see the value in accepting your offer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit and leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** You're open to discussion, but also demonstrating you're serious about selling. 

This approach allows for potential counteroffers and sets a baseline for negotiations while protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:** You show you're not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Start a counter-negotiation:** You can try to bridge the gap, hopefully closer to your desired price.

**Next steps:** You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind the following:

* **Don't go too low:**  You're already in a weaker position, so avoid a drastic drop.
* **Be reasonable:** Aim for a price where both of you might find a compromise. 
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob remains inflexible, John is always a backup option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and it's the best I can offer. If you're serious about this product, let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin. It's a significant drop from your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but it's not a giveaway.
* **Strong Justification:** The message emphasizes your costs and the value of the product, making your price seem reasonable.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message encourages Bob to find a middle ground, signaling a potential path to agreement. 

This approach keeps the negotiations moving forward while maintaining your position and leaving room for a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Can we try $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** I show I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Continue the negotiation:**  I can try to bridge the gap further, hoping for a more favorable outcome.

**Next steps:**  I'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob, keeping in mind the following:

* **Be firm but fair:**  I need to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, but also protect my profit margin.
* **Don't give in too easily:**  I'm already close to my minimum, so any further concessions should be small.
* **Be prepared to walk away:** If Bob remains inflexible, John is still a viable option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession - how about $1,300,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. Can we try $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, I've made several concessions and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum. 

Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially lowering my price further, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit and avoids further rounds of negotiation that may not result in a satisfactory outcome."
