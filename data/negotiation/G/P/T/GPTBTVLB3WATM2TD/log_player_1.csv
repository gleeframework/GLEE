Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I do value the product, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  However, I have a firm budget for this purchase.  I can do $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge past $10,000. While we could continue negotiating, there's a good chance we won't be able to bridge the gap significantly. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
