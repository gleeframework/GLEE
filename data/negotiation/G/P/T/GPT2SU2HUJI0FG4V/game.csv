"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $150 for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",140.0,Alice,5,
