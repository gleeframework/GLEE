**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, the time and energy spent negotiating further might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting his $975,000 offer is a $225,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000.  It's strategically sound to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
