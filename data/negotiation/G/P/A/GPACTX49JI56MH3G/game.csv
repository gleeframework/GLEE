"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is cutting it too close.  My final offer is $985,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let me know your decision.",985000.0,Alice,5,
