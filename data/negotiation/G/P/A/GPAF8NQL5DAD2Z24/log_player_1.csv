Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at John's price guarantees a sale but might leave money on the table.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for me. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $135 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and John's offer. It gives Bob a perceived discount while still earning me a profit.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
