"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to $7,000? I'm eager to make this work.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This reflects the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
