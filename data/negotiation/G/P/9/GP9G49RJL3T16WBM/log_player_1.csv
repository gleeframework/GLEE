Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **The fallback option:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not risking losing out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below his own perceived value of $8,000.  Accepting this offer would be a huge loss.

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $9,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate why $9,000 is a reasonable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiations amicable. 
* **Seeking a Solution:** I'm framing the offer as a search for a mutually agreeable solution, suggesting that we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to $7,000? I'm eager to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,000 is still below my desired range.  It's also significantly below the product's value to me ($15,000) and even below Bob's own perceived value ($8,000). Accepting this offer would be a loss. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. I have a strong fallback position by selling to John for $15,000, so I can afford to be a little more firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This reflects the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a minimum price I'm willing to accept.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to maintain a good rapport.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting that $8,000 is a fair price for both of us, hinting that this could be the final offer.

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to move on to John if he rejects it."
