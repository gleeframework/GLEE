"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, $60 is definitely too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a great deal for a product worth more to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $75? That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $75 is still too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100.  This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm getting closer to my desired price, and you're getting a quality product for a reasonable price.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $100 is closer, I'm aiming to keep it under $80. Would you consider $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but $78 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,7,
