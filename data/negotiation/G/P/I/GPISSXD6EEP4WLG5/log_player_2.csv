Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9,500. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $9,000 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, the negotiations have reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product for the best possible price within his budget."
