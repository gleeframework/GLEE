"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9,500. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $9,000 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",9250.0,Alice,5,
