Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to let you know that if we don't come to an agreement, I'll be forced to consider other options, including selling the product to a third party. I'm hoping we can still make this work, but I need a bit more room to breathe. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer. The difference between our last offer and her current one is relatively small.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Alice is signaling that she might walk away if we don't accept. While it's a negotiating tactic, there's a real risk she'll follow through.
* **Time Investment:** We've spent several rounds on this. Continuing to push for a slightly lower price might not be worth the additional time and effort.

Accepting the $1,075,000 offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
