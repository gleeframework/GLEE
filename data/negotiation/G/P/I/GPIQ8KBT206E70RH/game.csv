"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could consider a price closer to $13,500.  This feels like a fairer compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $12,000 is still a touch too high for me.  Would you be open to $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
