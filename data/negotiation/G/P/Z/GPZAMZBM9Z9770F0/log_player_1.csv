I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$900,000 is too low. I'll counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer as my backup."

I'm going to compromise a bit, but still aim for a price closer to my initial offer.  If Bob rejects again, I might consider selling to John, but I'll try to get closer to the middle ground first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to drop to $1,050,000, which is closer to the middle ground. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob has come up to my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and move on. John is offering a guaranteed sale at the same price, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
