Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay above $1600000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground.

Alice's offer is close to your upper limit. You've already rejected her previous offers, and it's getting late in the negotiation.
