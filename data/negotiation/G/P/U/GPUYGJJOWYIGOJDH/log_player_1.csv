Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. While I'm interested in the product, I can't go above $1000000. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not going to accept a price of $1,000,000.  I will try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay above $1,600,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1600000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I want to close a deal, I still believe this product has more value.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This price is fair, and it allows us both to walk away happy with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you too. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to drop below $1,400,000 yet. There's still room to negotiate, and I'd rather try to find a middle ground with Bob.  We're close to an agreement, and I think I can get a better price with a few more rounds."
