Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give me valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
