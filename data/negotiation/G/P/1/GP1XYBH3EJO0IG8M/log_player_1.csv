{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $105 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
