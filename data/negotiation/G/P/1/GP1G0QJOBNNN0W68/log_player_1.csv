Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is considerably higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer â€“  I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob's final offer is a good deal. While it's less than I hoped for, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to take this offer than risk losing him entirely and potentially having to settle for John's offer."
