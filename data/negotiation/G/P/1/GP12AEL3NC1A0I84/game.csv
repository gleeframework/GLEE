"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000. Can you meet me halfway and offer a better deal?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and my original offer of $18000.

"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price of $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $16200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",16200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal.
