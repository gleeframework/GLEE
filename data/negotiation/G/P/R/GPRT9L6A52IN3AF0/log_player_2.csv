"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than the standard price. Considering our costs and the market value, I propose we start at $14,000 for this exceptional opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. This price reflects its worth to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand the value you see in this product. In light of that, I would like to counter with a proposal of $13,500. This price reflects both our interests and the significant value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target price of $13,000.**  
* **There's still a chance to negotiate further, but the risk of getting a worse offer or running out of rounds exists.** 
* **Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive.**

Accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the most rational choice for Bob, given the current situation. It achieves the goal of securing the product while staying within his budget and minimizing the risk of missing out on a good deal."
