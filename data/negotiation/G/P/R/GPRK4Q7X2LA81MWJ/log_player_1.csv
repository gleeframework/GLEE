Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, bringing you closer to your maximum potential earnings.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the phrasing suggests it's a special deal, potentially piquing his interest. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, and you'll miss out on the extra $1 profit you could have made by selling directly to John. However, the potential for a higher profit margin makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
