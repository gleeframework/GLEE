Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and my minimum is also $10,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone of the message suggests I'm open to discussing the price, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer. 
* **Backup plan:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 if Bob declines, ensuring I don't lose out.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider."
