"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $18,000 for it. This is a special deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your $12,000 limit and even higher than its value to her. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, saving you a significant amount of money."
