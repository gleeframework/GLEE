Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he flatly refuses, you know he might be very price-sensitive. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $150, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  While continuing negotiation *might* lead to a slightly higher price, it's unlikely. Bob already stated he's trying to stay within a budget. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit without the risk of further negotiation."
