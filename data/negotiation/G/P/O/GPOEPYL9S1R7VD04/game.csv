"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
