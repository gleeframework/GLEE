"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a significant premium for you, considering your value of $1000000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. Let's try to split the difference. I'm happy to pay $1100000, which is still a significant profit for you.  This price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1120000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
