"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not interested in paying a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price from $180 to $160. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum value. I hope Bob will find this price more appealing and agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale. It's better than waiting and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer in the future."
