Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Creating a sense of value and urgency:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price. 
* **Backup option:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you at least $1,200,000. This allows you to be bolder in your negotiation with Bob."
