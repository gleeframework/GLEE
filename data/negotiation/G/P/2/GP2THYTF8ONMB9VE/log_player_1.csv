{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is less than what Bob believes the product is worth, making it appealing to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space to compromise if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for a better deal. We can counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to our desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.
