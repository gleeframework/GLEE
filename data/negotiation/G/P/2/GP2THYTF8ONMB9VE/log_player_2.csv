"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.
