"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a better price than John's $100, you can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Since the product is only worth $80 to her, there's room for you to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $85 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within my budget and a good price considering the product is worth $80 to her.  It's better than John's offer of $100, so I'll accept and finalize the deal."
