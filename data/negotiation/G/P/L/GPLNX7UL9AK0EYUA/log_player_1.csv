Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product offers you even greater value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as high as $1,250,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, his ""final offer"" language is likely a negotiation tactic. We still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.  We're not in a desperate situation to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. Let's settle at $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 1310000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're countering with a price that's a significant concession from our previous offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, we're also using firm language (""final offer"") to signal we're reaching our limit.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a desire to ""close the deal quickly,"" we're subtly introducing a time element, which could nudge Bob towards accepting. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This offer still keeps us well above our minimum sale price to John, allowing for a healthy profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more move to try to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,275,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strong Profit:** While not ideal, $1,275,000 is still a significant profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum. It's a solid return.
* **Bob's Movement:**  Bob has consistently moved upward in his offers, indicating a genuine interest in the product. He's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Remaining:** We're past the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Holding out much longer risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving us with John's lower offer. 
 
It's always tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, but in negotiation, knowing when to accept a good offer is crucial."
