"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that is extremely valuable to your business. Based on my understanding of its potential to enhance your operations, I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $900,000, a price that reflects its significant value while giving you a substantial advantage.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
