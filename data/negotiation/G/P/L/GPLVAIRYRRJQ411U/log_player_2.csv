"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is better than $10,000, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. He's already shown Alice his lower limit and is willing to negotiate further. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price even further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
