{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.75?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $88.75 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John. This ensures I get a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
