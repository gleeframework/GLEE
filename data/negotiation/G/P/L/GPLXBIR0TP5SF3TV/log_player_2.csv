"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You want to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. There's room for further negotiation, and you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your $85 target."
