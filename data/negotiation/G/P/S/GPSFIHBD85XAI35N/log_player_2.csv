"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I still get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for me. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible and $1,000,000 is far from my target of $800,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you're seeking. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $950,000 is still higher than my target. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference and agree on $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  There are a few rounds left, and I'm not yet ready to accept a price above $900,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $910,000? This is a fair price considering our respective positions and would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 910000}
