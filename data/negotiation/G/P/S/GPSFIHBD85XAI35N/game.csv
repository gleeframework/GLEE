"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I still get a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you're seeking. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference and agree on $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $910,000? This is a fair price considering our respective positions and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",910000.0,Bob,6,
