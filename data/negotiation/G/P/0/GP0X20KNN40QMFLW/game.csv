"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it gives you a fair price for a great product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but I need to be closer to $100 to make this deal work for me.  How about $99? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's the best I can do right now.  Let me know what you think.",99.0,Alice,5,
