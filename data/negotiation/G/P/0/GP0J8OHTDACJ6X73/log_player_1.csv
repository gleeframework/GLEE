Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a revised offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's worth and my willingness to commit to the purchase. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob has shown consistent interest. Holding firm for now maintains the potential for a higher sale price."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see you're serious about acquiring this product.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my commitment to purchasing it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has not budged from his $1,200,000 offer, signaling this is likely his ceiling. Accepting now secures a $200,000 profit over John's offer. Further negotiation risks pushing him away without a significant increase in price."
