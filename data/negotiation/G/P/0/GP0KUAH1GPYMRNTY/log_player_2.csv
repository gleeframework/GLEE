"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer gives you the chance to negotiate further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
