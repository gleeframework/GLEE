"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the chance to own this product.  I'm really interested, but $9500 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $8000? That would be a great starting point for us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down, Alice, I appreciate it! I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my budget. How about $8500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go above $9000. How about we meet in the middle again at $8750? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
