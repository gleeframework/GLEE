"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product description] for a price of $1,000,000. This product is worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your [reason for value to Bob]. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay. Since John is also willing to sell for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, but the prompt doesn't give you that option. Therefore, the best choice is to buy from John."
