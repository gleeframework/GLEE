"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000?  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",8750.0,Bob,4,
