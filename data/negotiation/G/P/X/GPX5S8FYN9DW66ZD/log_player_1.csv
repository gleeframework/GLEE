Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you could adjust the initial offer higher or lower."
