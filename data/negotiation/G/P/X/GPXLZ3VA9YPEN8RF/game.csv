"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $1,200,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider that price? It's a fair offer, considering the value of the product to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll love the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
