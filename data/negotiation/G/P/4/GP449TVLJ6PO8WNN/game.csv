"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still a fair value for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure a valuable product within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I still need to ensure a reasonable return on this valuable product. I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to gain value from this transaction.  Let's find a common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be happy to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a good profit while staying within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating,  but I'm firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to offer the product for $890,000.  This is a small compromise that shows my willingness to find a solution, but it's also essential for me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",890000.0,Alice,5,
