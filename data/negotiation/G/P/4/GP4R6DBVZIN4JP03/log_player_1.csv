Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $120, but not exorbitantly high. It allows for some negotiation room while still being profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$80 is far too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120 to Bob. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I hope it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'll accept John's offer of $120 and sell the product to him."
