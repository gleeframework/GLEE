{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than immediately rejecting.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I can quickly move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob is showing interest, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John is Still an Option:**  If negotiations with Bob don't work out, John is a guaranteed sale for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this work.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Higher:**  $10,500 is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.
* **Fairness Language:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" reinforces the idea of a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Not Too High:**  I'm keeping the counter-offer lower than my fallback price of $15,000, to leave room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Accepting this offer would mean sacrificing a significant amount of profit. Continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate, but it's still worth the risk to try and get closer to my target price.
* **John is Still an Option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a good step forward, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price given the value of the product and our respective budgets. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** $10,000 is a final compromise. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous counter-offer. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Language:**  This language emphasizes a collaborative approach and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Last Negotiation:**  This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before turning to John.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. We've reached a stalemate, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could take more time and energy.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which meets my minimum price and ensures I get the best possible outcome.

While I would like to sell to Bob, it's not worth risking a lower profit or wasting time when I have a guaranteed sale waiting with John."
