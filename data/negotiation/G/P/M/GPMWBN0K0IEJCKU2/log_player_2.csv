# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I think the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,200 is better than $12,000, Bob is still looking to save more.  He can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get the price down further. It's worth trying to get closer to his desired price of $10,500."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $11,100. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,100, which is only $100 more than Bob's last offer of $10,750.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer saves Bob $900 compared to buying from John, making it the most cost-effective option."
