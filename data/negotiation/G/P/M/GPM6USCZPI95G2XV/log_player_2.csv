# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's worth. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,075,000 is a fair price, but I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,090,000. This is a good compromise and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.
