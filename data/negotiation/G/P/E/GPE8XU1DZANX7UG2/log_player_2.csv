"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  There is room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also looking for a significant discount. $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $800,000. This leaves room for further negotiation while testing Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $950,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This accounts for your initial offer while recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired target.  Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and continue to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a desire to find common ground. This counteroffer is strategically placed to see if Alice is willing to concede further, as it is closer to the middle ground between the two offers, making it more likely that she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I value a quick close, I also believe in fair deals. Let's split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000. This reflects the value you're gaining and ensures a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has the leverage to push for a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm firm at $980,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a commitment to reaching an agreement, but he's still pushing for a lower price.  He's increased his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his desired budget. This counteroffer is a strategic move, as it's very close to Alice's last offer, making it more likely that she will accept and close the deal."
