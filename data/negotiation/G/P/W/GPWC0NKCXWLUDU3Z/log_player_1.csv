**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now offering his maximum value, it's still less than what John is offering. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better offer, and we risk leaving John's offer on the table. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $120 from John."
