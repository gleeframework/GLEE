"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Flexibility:**  The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, indicating I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Safety Net:** While I'm aiming for a higher price, I have the option to sell to John at $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate he's interested in the product.  This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Not Yet Ready for John:**  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John now would mean leaving money on the table, especially if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the potential for profit for both of us. This helps Bob see the value in the deal from his perspective.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price than John's offer, as I'm optimistic about reaching a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We're still in the early stages of negotiations, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer further. 
* **Not Yet Ready for John:**  Selling to John now would mean missing out on the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Bob. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a considerable investment for you, but it also reflects the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm making another compromise, lowering my price from $1,250,000 to $1,000,000. This shows continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Pressure and Patience:** While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, Bob might be willing to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  $1000000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $800,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. It's worth continuing to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Selling to John now would be settling for a price that's far below what I believe the product is worth, and it's possible that Bob might be willing to go even higher.

I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $800,000. However, I still need to ensure I can get a fair return on this product. To compromise, I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is a significant investment for you, but it's also a reasonable price given the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm lowering my price to $900,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his budget. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, justifying the higher price.
* **Balancing Risks:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely need to move closer to John's price in the next round."
