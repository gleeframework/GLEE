Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-offer:**  I have a chance to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also showing flexibility by offering a counteroffer. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $11,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating good faith, but still above his initial offer.
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise that is fair for both parties, fostering a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Maintaining the Option to Sell to John:**  I haven't completely closed the door on selling to John, so I have a backup plan if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. Can we try $10,200? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $10,200 is just a little below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer. 
* **Fair Compromise:** Bob is offering a genuine compromise by meeting me halfway.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and starting another round of negotiations is high. It's possible that I might end up with a lower price or lose Bob altogether, leaving me with only the option of selling to John. 
* **Time Factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more time and energy I'm investing.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on."
