Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's only got 3 rounds left, and Alice has come down to a price that's within his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge, and he could end up buying from John for more than he wants.  It's a good deal for both of them, as Alice is getting closer to her desired price and Bob is getting a lower price than he initially expected."
