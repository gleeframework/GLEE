"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher price to make this work.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still allows you to make a good profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value it brings. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  How about $1,075,000?  It's a reasonable price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make a deal!",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000, but I need to take a small discount to make it work for me. Can we do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
