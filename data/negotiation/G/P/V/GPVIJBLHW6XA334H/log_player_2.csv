"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it's of great value and will be beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and John is your backup at that price. There's no need to pay Alice $140.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower the price to make a sale."
