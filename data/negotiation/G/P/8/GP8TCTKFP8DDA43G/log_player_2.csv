"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John publicly, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
