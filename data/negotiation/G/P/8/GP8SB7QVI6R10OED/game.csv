"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high. Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a slight increase from our previous discussion. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,7,
