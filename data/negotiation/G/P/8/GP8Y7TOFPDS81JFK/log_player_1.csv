Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to explore if I can get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Exclusivity:**  By highlighting an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I aim to pique Bob's interest and potentially make him more amenable to the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potentially mutually beneficial agreement."
