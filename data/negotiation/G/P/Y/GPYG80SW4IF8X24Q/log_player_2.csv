"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your initial thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer again will help you continue to negotiate down the price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my target.  Let's try $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that balances the product's worth with my budget."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,340,000? This is a small adjustment on my end, but I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is within your budget and is getting closer to your ideal price. It's worth accepting the offer now, as there's a risk of the negotiation going on for longer and ending up with a higher price, or you might end up buying from John for a higher price."
