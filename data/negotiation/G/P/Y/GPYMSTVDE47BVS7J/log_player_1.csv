```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but we haven't reached an agreement yet.  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm running out of time. To ensure I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While it's not the best possible outcome, it's a safe choice given the limited time and the potential for further negotiations to fail."
