Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $100, but leaves some room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to see this as a fair starting point since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price.  I've already lowered my price twice and still haven't secured a deal.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing more time. I'll sell the product to John for $100 to guarantee a sale."
