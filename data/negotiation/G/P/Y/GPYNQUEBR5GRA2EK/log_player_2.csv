"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. You can likely get a better deal, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is appreciated, it's unfortunately a bit lower than I can go right now. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit more than you want to pay. You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference - how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You have already rejected $110 twice, and you only have 5 rounds left. While you might be able to get a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $150 to John is now higher. It's best to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
