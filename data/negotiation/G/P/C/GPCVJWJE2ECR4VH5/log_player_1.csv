Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for potential negotiation down to a price closer to Bob's value, without dropping below my minimum threshold. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me confidence to not settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and attempt to reach a price that is closer to my desired amount while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get by emphasizing that $13,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Middle Ground:**  $13,500 is a fair middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Margin:** This offer still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price while potentially closing the deal with Bob."
