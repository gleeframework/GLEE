Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a better price from John, so there's no reason to accept anything above his $12,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think.

Bob should buy the product from John. He has already stated his maximum price, and Alice is still above it.  It's time to move on to a sure deal with John."
