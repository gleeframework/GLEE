"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Even if Alice rejects the first counteroffer, there's a chance Bob can work towards a price closer to $1,000,000.  Buying from John immediately means missing out on potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's desire to find a fair price while also showing that he's willing to walk away if necessary.  A counteroffer closer to $1,000,000 may be too aggressive and risk Alice rejecting it outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or the negotiation taking too long makes accepting this offer the best choice.  Bob can save $200,000 compared to John's price."
