Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's significantly higher than what you'd get from John, but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal (as the product is worth $15,000 to him). This strategy aims to maximize your profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting your offer."
