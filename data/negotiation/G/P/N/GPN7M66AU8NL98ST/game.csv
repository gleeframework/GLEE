"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that $13,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12900.0,Alice,3,
