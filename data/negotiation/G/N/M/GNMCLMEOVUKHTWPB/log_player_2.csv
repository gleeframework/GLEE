"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You can always buy from John for $150 if you can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $125. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to my limit, I'm still willing to try for a better deal.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm going to offer $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm still prepared to buy from John if necessary."
