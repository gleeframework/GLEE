"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
