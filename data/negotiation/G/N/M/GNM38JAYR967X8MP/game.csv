"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $1500000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I still think the product's value to you is higher than $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I think we're getting close, though. I'll make another counteroffer of $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $795000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $795000 is your final offer, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'll make one more counteroffer of $815000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,
