Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110. How about we try $112.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my preferred price, $112.50 is still above my $120 budget. I'll try to negotiate further, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $112.50 is still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to go down to $110?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $110, which is $111.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to go down to my target price. While $111.25 is getting closer, it's still above my budget of $120.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're getting stuck.  At this point, I'm better off buying from John for $120 to avoid further haggling."
