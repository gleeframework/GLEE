Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  This means a deal is impossible unless someone is willing to compromise or we find creative solutions.

**The Offer**

Since a standard negotiation won't work, you have two options:

**Option 1: Aim High and Hope for a Compromise**

You could start with a high offer, hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium for some reason (e.g., urgency, you're the only source).

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

* **Pros:**  You might get lucky, and Bob could surprise you.
* **Cons:** High chance Bob rejects the offer, and you'll get your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Option 2: Be Transparent and Explore Alternatives**

Since the traditional negotiation space doesn't work, transparency and creativity might be the key.

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm aware this product is worth $1,200,000 to you, while I need to sell it for at least $1,500,000. Let's explore if there's a creative solution where we both benefit. Perhaps there's a way to add value to the product, or maybe you have something you'd consider including in the deal."", ""product_price"": ""Open for discussion""}
```

* **Pros:** Opens the door for a mutually beneficial agreement that a standard negotiation might miss.
* **Cons:** Requires more effort, and there's no guarantee you'll find a solution. 

**Important Note:**  Without more information about Bob's motivations or potential flexibility, it's impossible to say which option is definitively ""better."""
