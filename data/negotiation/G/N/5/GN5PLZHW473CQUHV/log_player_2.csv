"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your ideal price point. While Alice may reject it initially, starting with your target price establishes a clear position and leaves room for compromise. You're willing to walk away if she doesn't budge, so you have leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,200,000 is still too high. Since you are willing to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to settle yet. Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows your willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. It's a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer, but still above John's price, making it a potentially acceptable middle ground. This move keeps the negotiation moving forward and demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, and while $1,225,000 is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still not ideal.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's time to take the safer option and buy from John.  There's no guarantee that you can get Alice to go any lower, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
