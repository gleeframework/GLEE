"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $6,750 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $7,125. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",7125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering but I'm really trying to keep it under $7,000. Would you be willing to do $6,900 and we can close the deal right now?",6900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $7,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value.  If you're serious about getting this, I'm ready to close the deal now.",7000.0,Alice,7,
