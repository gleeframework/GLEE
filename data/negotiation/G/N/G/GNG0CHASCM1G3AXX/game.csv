"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we settle at $1,750,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I need to be within my budget. Can we meet at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
