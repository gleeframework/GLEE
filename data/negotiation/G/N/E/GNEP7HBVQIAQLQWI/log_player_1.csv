Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy gives me some room to maneuver if Bob counteroffers, and it also encourages him to think about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $75 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get, I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for this awesome product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $78 is slightly lower than I hoped for, it's a fair price considering Bob's continued interest and the possibility of further negotiation. It's also a better option than selling to John for $80.  I'll take it and move on!"
