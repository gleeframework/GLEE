Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 (her product's value to her).
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim slightly above Bob's maximum price. This creates a scenario where Bob might see a small ""deal"" compared to his perceived value, while still netting Alice a profit above her minimum.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Why this Works**

* **Above Bob's Limit, But Appealing:** The price is slightly above what Bob ideally wants to pay, but it might be tempting enough if he values the product highly. 
* **Protects Alice's Interest:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything. She can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John at her desired price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. Negotiation is a complex dance, and success depends on many factors. However, this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit while considering the available information."
