"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This price reflects a compromise on my part, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe it's a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to drop her price significantly below $900,000. Bob has already countered twice and gotten to a price of $875,000, but Alice is only willing to come down to $925,000. It is unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price that Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for Bob to accept the guaranteed price of $800,000 from John, as this saves him $25,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
