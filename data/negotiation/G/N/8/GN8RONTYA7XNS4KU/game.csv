"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial asking price is $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and potential for growth.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's potential for growth.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product and me to secure a price that reflects its true worth.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $925,000. I'd like to propose $875,000 as a more comfortable price for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to reaching an agreement.  Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000. This would allow me to secure a price that's closer to my desired range while still providing you with a valuable product at a competitive rate.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $900,000. I'd like to propose $875,000 as a final offer. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Bob,8,
