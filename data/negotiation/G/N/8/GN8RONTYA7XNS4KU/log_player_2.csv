Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.

# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.
