"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 for it. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you consider a significant price reduction?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To be honest, anything above $10,000 would be pushing it for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your honesty. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a realistic offer from you.  Would you be willing to meet at $15,000?  That's the lowest I'm prepared to go.",15000.0,Alice,5,
