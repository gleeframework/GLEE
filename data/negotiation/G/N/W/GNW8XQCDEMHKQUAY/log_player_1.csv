"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features and potential"" aims to subtly anchor Bob's perception closer to my valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point"" signals my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

By starting strong and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is still a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can guide the price closer to my desired range. I'm willing to leverage the security of John's offer if needed, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the market, this product offers significant value that justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, But Firm:** I've made a concession from my initial offer, but it's a relatively small one ($50,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still reinforcing the product's value.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the unique value proposition of the product to shift Bob's focus from just ""market value.""
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing the price as a ""fair deal"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable outcome, even though it's still above his initial offer.

I believe this counteroffer balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,025,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is becoming smaller. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in later rounds. It's always possible Bob might have gone higher, but this offer represents a satisfactory outcome."
