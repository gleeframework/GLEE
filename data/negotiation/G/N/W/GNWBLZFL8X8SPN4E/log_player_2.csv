"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $810,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the price difference is no longer significant enough to warrant the risk of continued negotiation. Accepting at $825,000 secures a good deal."
