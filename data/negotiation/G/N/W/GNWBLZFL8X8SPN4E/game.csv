"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. How about we settle at $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $810,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
