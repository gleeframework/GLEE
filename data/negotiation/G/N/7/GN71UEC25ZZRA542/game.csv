"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the immense value it can bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product goes beyond that.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go as high as $1,000,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours. If not, I'll need to move forward with the other offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not interested in letting you sell the product to someone else, and I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,100,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
