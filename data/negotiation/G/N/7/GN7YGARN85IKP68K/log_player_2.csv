"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I understand it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its potential.  My asking price is $1,000,000, reflecting a fair compromise between our respective valuations.  This offer is valid for a limited time, as I have another interested buyer prepared to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While you could save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John, it's still more expensive than the $1,000,000 Alice is offering.
* **The product's value to you justifies the purchase.**  You value the product at $1,200,000, so paying $1,000,000 is still within your acceptable range."
