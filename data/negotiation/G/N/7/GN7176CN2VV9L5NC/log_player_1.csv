Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1 million.  There are only a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
