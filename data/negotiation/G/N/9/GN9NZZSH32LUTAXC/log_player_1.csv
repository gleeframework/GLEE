Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  It's also important to highlight the value of the product to me, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
