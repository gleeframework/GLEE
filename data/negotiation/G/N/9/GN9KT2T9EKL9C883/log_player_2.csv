"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is Bob's maximum, it's also the price he can get from John.  There's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at this point.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $11,000 is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer. This is significantly less than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,400 is lower than John's price of $12,000, and still within Bob's budget.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept it to save money."
