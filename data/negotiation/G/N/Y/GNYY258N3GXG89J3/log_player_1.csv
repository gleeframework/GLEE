Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. It's higher than John's offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob counters, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  To ensure I get at least the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to sell to John."
