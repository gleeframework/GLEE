Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it slightly above that might entice him. A price of $13,500 leaves room for negotiation but keeps you well above your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""public listing"" and ""other interest"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
