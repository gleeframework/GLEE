"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $8000, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and $8500. How about $8850? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",8850.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the price as low as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $8700? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8700.0,Alice,7,
