Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very serious about making a deal, but I'm also on a tight budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation:  Bob has reached his maximum budget and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting his offer would leave money on the table, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of him lowering his offer further. Selling to John guarantees the reserve price and avoids further negotiation risk."
