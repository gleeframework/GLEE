"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your previous asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to get closer to my desired price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
