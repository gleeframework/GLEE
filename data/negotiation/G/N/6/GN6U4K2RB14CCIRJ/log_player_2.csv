"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice will come down further.  Bob can still buy from John for $12,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your previous asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While Alice seems willing to negotiate, there's a risk that the negotiation will continue to drag on.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John at $12,000, it makes more sense to go with the sure thing and avoid further negotiation."
