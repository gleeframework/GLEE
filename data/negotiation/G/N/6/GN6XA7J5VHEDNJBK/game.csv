"Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its potential worth to you.  Let's start our negotiation journey from here.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would $700,000 work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too far off from what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for you to profit from this valuable product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's try to find common ground at this point.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this deal done. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there!  I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's finalize this agreement now.",800000.0,Alice,7,
