Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would $700,000 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too far off from what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for you to profit from this valuable product.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's try to find common ground at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there!  I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's finalize this agreement now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her minimum:** She's clearly stated that $800,000 is her lowest price. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $200,000 less than John's offer and $200,000 less than your maximum budget.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** Trying to push for a lower price might make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
