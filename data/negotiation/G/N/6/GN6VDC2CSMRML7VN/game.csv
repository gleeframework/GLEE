"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise that lets us both walk away happy. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
