"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I recognize its value, your asking price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I could consider a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain from it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $7,000. That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price gap is still too wide.  I need to get at least $15,000 for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as my final offer.  This is a great deal considering its true value. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
