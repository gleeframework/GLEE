Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is higher than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's space for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not starting with a lowball offer, suggesting you believe in the product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, it's not in your best interest.  

**Here's why you should reject:**

* **Potential Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer means losing out on potential profit. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, making Bob's offer less attractive.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range. 

You have leverage in this situation. You can use the counteroffer to try and reach a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial price, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, but still significantly higher than his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** You're emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential he stands to gain by acquiring it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves the door open for further negotiation, suggesting you're willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

By taking this approach, you're showing flexibility while maintaining your desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is your minimum acceptable price.  While you'd love to get more, this is a good outcome considering:

* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay the same amount.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might not lead to a higher price, and could waste time.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and move on.

It's a win-win situation. You achieve your minimum goal, and Bob gets a product he values highly."
