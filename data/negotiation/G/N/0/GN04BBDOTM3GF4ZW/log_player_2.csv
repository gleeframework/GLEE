Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.

We're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. Let's see if we can negotiate further with Alice."
