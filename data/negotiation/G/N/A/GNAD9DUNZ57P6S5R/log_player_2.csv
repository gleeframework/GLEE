"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $14,000. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Considering your valuation of the product, I am willing to negotiate down to $13,000. This is my final offer, as the product has significant value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate.  $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, but there's potential for Alice to come down further.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our values and gives us a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am prepared to offer the product at $12,750. This price reflects the value of the product to both parties and allows for a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:**  $12,750 is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Reaching Agreement:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Risk of Loss:**  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely. While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or making a higher counteroffer is present. 

It's a good time for Bob to accept and secure a good deal."
