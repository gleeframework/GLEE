Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $180. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $180, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, we've made a nice profit. If he rejects, we can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than the asking price, which might make Bob more inclined to accept."
