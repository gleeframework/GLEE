"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to see if I can get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message aims to be polite and frame my counteroffer as reasonable, not confrontational. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My goal is to secure the product for a price closer to Alice's value ($100) while staying well below John's backup offer ($150)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $120? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I'm willing to pay, but I think there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on and allows me to push for a slightly better deal. I'm aiming for something closer to $110 before I consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a price I can feel good about."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my previous offer ($105) and her current offer ($120). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I continue to use friendly and positive language to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Approaching My Limit:** I'm getting closer to my upper limit, but I believe there's still a chance to settle slightly lower than $115. However, I'm prepared to accept if Alice agrees to this price."
