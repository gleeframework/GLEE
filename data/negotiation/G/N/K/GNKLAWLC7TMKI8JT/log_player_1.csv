Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, hoping that Bob will be willing to pay that amount. Let's see how he responds!"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent amount.
