Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture as much of the potential profit as possible. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but still staying well above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a good price for me, and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum and I'm worried we might not be able to make a deal if I reject it. I'm going to accept the offer and secure the sale."
