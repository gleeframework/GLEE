Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **For me:**  I get $40 more than selling to John, which is a significant gain.
* **For Bob:** He gets the product for $10 less than its value to him, making it a good deal. 

This strategy aims to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a substantial profit."
