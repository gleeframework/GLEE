Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, you're setting a high anchor.  Even if Bob counters much lower, the initial price can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  You always have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.  Therefore, any offer Bob makes below that is not worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than both your valuation and your initial asking price. While it's tempting to accept an offer above John's standing offer, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about a higher price and open the door for a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). It suggests a willingness to compromise while still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob reinforces why a higher price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above your safety net (John's $1,000,000 offer), providing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer slightly, it's clear he's unwilling to move substantially closer to your valuation.  His latest offer of $950,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.  

At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's more profitable to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
