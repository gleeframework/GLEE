"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity for a counteroffer and further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,500, which is a significant move.  This price is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his initial counteroffer.  There is still potential for further negotiation, but accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a deal within Bob's target price range.  The remaining rounds could be used to negotiate a lower price from John if Bob later decides to explore that option."
