"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I think I can still get it lower. I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $98 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $108? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $108 is a decent price, saving me $12 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and avoid potentially over-negotiating."
