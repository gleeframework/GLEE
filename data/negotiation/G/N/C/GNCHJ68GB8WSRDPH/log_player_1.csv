Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. It also emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 (to John) gives me a strong bargaining position. I don't need to go below that price. 

This strategy aims for a high but justifiable price, hoping Bob recognizes the value and accepts. Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance of closing a deal significantly above $800,000."
