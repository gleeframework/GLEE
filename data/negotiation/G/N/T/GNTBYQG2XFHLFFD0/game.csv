"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This still leaves me a small profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and our negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,4,
