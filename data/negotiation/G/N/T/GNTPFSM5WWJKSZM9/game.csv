"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its true market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
