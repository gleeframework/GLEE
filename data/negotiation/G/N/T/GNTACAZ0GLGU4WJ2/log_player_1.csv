Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, which increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** Even though $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $150. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price. 
* **Safety net:** I have the option of selling to John for $150, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I believe it's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining value:**  $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant value for Bob.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and respectful tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $105 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially getting a lower price than I can get from John.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed profit. 

While it's tempting to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  I have a solid backup option with John, and it's best to take it."
