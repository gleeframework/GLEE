"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be immensely beneficial to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Near Bob's Value:** While starting high, I'm staying close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).  This shows I've done my research and am serious about selling, but at a price that reflects the product's worth to him.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, even if it's slightly below his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Reasoning:

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my target price and his perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in Round 3 to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell it for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to find a compromise that feels fair to both parties. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By moving down from my initial offer, I show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage him to do the same. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price of $1,350,000 is still a significant amount above my minimum and reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's value, I think a fair price would be $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is quite strong. It's only a $25,000 difference from my last counteroffer. 
* **Time Considerations:**  We are now in Round 4. While I have time for further negotiation, there's always a risk that Bob could walk away or significantly lower his offer. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting this offer secures a profit of $325,000 above my minimum acceptable price. This is a substantial return and worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing the deal."
