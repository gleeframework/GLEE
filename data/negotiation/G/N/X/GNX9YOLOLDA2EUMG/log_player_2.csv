"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,450,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He should counteroffer to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your budget considerations, the value this product offers is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?

Bob should continue to try to negotiate a lower price.  While Alice has come down, $1,400,000 is still above his budget. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice down to a more agreeable price."
