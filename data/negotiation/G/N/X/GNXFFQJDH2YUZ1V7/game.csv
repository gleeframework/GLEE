"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $130. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too. I'm willing to offer the product for $132.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",132.5,Alice,5,
