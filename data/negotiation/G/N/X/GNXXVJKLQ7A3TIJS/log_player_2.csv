"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for someone like you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant price point, reflecting the product's true potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price, potentially saving even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your perspective, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer at $1,100,000 saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John and is still a good deal for Bob.  Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and forcing Bob to buy from John makes accepting the current offer the best choice."
