Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
