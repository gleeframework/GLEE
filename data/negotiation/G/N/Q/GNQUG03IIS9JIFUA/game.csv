"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $8,500, but I'm not sure I can meet you there. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While I do value the product, $9,800 is still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer to a deal, but I still think $9,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,800, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,400. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,400 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200, but I'll throw in an additional concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,200, and I'll also include a 1-year warranty, which is a $500 value. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product and the added warranty.",9200.0,Alice,7,
