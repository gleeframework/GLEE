"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, the price point is a bit high for my current budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. I would like to counter with a price of $8,500. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while being competitive. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'm willing to consider $7,500 as a counteroffer. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being accommodating. Please let me know if this proposal suits your needs.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer a final price of $7,100. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",7100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm glad we've been able to communicate effectively. I'm willing to come down to $7,300 as a counteroffer. This still provides a good return for us while remaining competitive. I hope this proposal works for you.",7300.0,Alice,7,
