# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who's already expressed strong interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
