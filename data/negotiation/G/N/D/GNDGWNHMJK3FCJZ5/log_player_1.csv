"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob is only willing to pay $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, there's no room for further negotiation.
