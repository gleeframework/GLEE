"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  How does $105 sound? This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a little more than my minimum. Let me know if you're interested!
