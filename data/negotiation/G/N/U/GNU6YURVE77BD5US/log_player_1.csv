Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $800,000.**  If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed that amount from John.
* **I want to maximize my profit.** By offering $900,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potential profit above my minimum. 
* **I don't know Bob's valuation.** This makes it a gamble. If the product is worth significantly more to Bob, he may be willing to pay my price. If it's worth less, he'll likely reject and I'll go with John."
