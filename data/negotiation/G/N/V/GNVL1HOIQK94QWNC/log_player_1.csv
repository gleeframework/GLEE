Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his interest level and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while minimizing risk."
