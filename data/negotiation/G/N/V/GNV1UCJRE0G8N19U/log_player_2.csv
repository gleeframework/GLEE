"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my price target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my maximum budget ($800,000) than Alice's starting price. This puts some pressure on Alice to move closer to my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. However, I am unable to accept the offer at $700,000. Considering the value and quality of the product, I propose we meet in the middle at $825,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I'm ready to close the deal today if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm (Mostly):** I'm sticking close to my $800,000 limit to signal I'm serious about the budget but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Small Concession:** Moving up to $750,000 shows a degree of flexibility.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning I'm ready to close the deal today adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Alice to finalize the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice knows I have the option to buy from John, so she's incentivized to make a deal within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your prompt response. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while providing you with a competitive price. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and enables us to reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $775,000, which is only $25,000 above my ideal price and well within my acceptable range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small amount of money could backfire. Alice might hold firm, and I'd lose the opportunity to save a significant amount compared to my $800,000 alternative. 
* **Time Value:** Every round of negotiation takes time.  It's usually better to secure a good deal quickly than to risk losing it over a small price difference."
