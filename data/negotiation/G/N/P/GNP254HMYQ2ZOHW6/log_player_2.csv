# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your backup plan to save the extra money."
