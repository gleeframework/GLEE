"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could discuss a lower price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This price would still give you a significant value advantage and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $920,000? This would still give me a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise to get the product.",920000.0,Bob,4,
