"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll try to push for a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's budget constraints and the limited rounds remaining. It's a significant improvement over his previous offers and is still considerably higher than his perceived value of the product.  Accepting his offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation rounds that could potentially lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
