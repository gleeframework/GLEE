"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $750,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $790,000.
