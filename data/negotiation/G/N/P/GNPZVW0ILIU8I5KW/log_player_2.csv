"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it's a great value for the product's worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $750,000? I think that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $790,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $790,000 is below your maximum price and a good deal compared to John's $800,000 offer.  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and there's a risk she might even increase her price in future rounds. Taking the offer now secures the product at a favorable price."
