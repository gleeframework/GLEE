Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good price. Let's make this happen!

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and appreciate your offer.  $120 is getting very close, but I'm still just a bit off. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize this purchase.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we only have a few rounds left. I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $100, which is my ideal price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice at this point."
