"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This allows me to acknowledge your interest while ensuring a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.  Let's find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's full value. Let's settle this at $975,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize the deal, I'm offering my final price of $925,000. This is a significant move from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine desire to acquire this product. I hope you'll accept it.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair balance between our respective positions.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit above my limit. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $940,000. This is a small increase from my last offer, and hopefully we can close the deal now. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial.",940000.0,Bob,8,
