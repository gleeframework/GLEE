Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still outside my price range.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product.  Let's find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's full value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize the deal, I'm offering my final price of $925,000. This is a significant move from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine desire to acquire this product. I hope you'll accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is increasing his offer, we are still in a strong position. We have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 and still have several rounds to negotiate. We need to push Bob closer to at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair balance between our respective positions."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but fair:**  By stating this is our final offer, we add pressure on Bob to accept while still leaving room for a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  $950,000 is a strong position. It's a significant profit above Bob's valuation, and if he walks away, we still have John as a backup.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only three rounds left, we need to move towards a conclusion. This offer might prompt Bob to either accept or make a significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit above my limit. To reach an agreement, I'm offering $940,000. This is a small increase from my last offer, and hopefully we can close the deal now. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining two rounds. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Time is money, and the potential gain from Bob is now outweighed by the guaranteed sale to John.
* **Strong Position:**  We've negotiated well and held our ground. Walking away with a sure $1,200,000 is a win, even if it means leaving a slightly higher offer from Bob on the table."
