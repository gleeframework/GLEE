Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""investment"" to steer Bob's focus away from his perceived value and towards the potential benefits.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario, I maximize profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens a dialogue. Depending on his counter-offer, I can either negotiate down slightly or hold firm, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Bob Rejects:** I simply proceed with selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
