"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too large. Perhaps $650,000 would be more enticing for me? It reflects my seriousness about purchasing the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm committed to finding an agreement.  However, $650,000 remains too low.  Let's settle this at $1,200,000. I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To meet you halfway, I propose $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest I'm willing to accept for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
