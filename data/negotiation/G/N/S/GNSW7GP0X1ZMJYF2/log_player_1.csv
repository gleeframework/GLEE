Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it will greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob might scare him away. Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below John's offer allows for potential negotiation and profit maximization.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" before a public listing adds perceived value for Bob."
