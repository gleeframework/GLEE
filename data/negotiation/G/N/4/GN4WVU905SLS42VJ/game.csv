"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value is high, but I'm working within a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
