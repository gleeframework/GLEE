"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This price gives us both a good margin, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm counteroffering at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,5,
