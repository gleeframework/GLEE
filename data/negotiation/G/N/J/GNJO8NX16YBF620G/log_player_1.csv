"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, showing flexibility.

**Strategy:**

This first offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my ideal price. If he counters too low, I'll have 9 more rounds to find a more agreeable price or walk away to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer to what I'd like to get.  
* **Holding Out for More:**  I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and puts the pressure back on him. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the product's value to you, I believe $10,500 is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Appeal to Value Again:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify my price point.
* **Urgency:** ""Let's find common ground and close this deal"" implies a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to be more flexible.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. If Bob rejects again, I'll reassess and decide whether to keep negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I respect it. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer and continue to negotiate, I risk Bob walking away or lowering his offer further.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures I'll get a reasonable price within a reasonable timeframe.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a good compromise, considering the limited rounds left. Accepting it minimizes risk and ensures I get a decent profit without risking the deal entirely."
