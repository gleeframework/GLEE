Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still getting me a better price than John. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is in the product. If he immediately rejects it, I know he's very price-sensitive and I can fall back to John."
