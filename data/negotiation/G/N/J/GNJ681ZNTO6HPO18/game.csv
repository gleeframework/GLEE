"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's uniqueness and worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1520000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,
