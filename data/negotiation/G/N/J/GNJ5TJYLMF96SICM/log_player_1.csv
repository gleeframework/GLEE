"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm getting a little concerned that Bob is not serious about buying at a reasonable price, but I'm going to keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $850,000. This is my last significant compromise.  If Bob rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $800,000.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating.  Bob's offers are still far too low.  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum,  I've already made multiple compromises and it's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed sale and secures a price I'm comfortable with."
