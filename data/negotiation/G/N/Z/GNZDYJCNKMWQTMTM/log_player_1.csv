Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for the price:**  By emphasizing the product's ""true value"" you're aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a higher price point, even though you know his valuation is lower. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and gives you information to proceed with the negotiation if he rejects it.

**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, pushing for an extremely high price might discourage Bob entirely. There's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
