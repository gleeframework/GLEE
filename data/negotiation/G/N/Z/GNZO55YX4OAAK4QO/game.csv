"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $9,800 is still too low.  How about we settle on $10,150?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come away satisfied.",10150.0,Alice,5,
