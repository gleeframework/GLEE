Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price of $12,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a bit more.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $9,800 is still too low.  How about we settle on $10,150?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $9,500, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still happy to negotiate with you.  I've lowered my price several times now, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  How about $9,900?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. We've only got two rounds left, and if I reject this offer, I might have to sell to John for a significantly lower price.  $9,600 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can make a profit."
