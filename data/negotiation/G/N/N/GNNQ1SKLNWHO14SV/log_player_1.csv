Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even at a premium. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $700,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While ideally, I'd like to earn more, $900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations going further downward or losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
