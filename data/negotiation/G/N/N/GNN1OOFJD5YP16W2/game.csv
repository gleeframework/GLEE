"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,450,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This is a substantial discount on my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $1,350,000 offer. I am still looking to keep within my budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this might be a point of agreement for us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
