"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $725,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
