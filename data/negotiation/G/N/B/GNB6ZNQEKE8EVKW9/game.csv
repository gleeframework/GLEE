"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $90 for the product. This is the highest price we can go without exceeding our minimum acceptable value. Please let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
