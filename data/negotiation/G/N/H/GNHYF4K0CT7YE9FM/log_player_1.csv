Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is more than my floor price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob and what I can potentially get. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $875,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves a good margin for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I believe the product can bring to our business, I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my floor price of $800,000 and is a good deal considering the limited number of rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of a counteroffer that might be even lower."
