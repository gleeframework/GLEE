"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $875,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves a good margin for you.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
