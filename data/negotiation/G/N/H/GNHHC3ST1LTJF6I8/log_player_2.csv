"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and Alice's offer of $95 is still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer was $95, and I'm willing to pay up to $100.  I'm offering $85, which is halfway between our initial positions.  This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer and gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $90 is still above my ideal price of $85, but it's closer to my upper limit of $100.  Considering I'm willing to buy from John for $100, accepting this offer means I save $10. It's not the best deal possible, but it's a good compromise and a reasonable price."
