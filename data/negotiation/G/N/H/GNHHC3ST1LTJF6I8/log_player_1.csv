Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80 but also leaves room for negotiation. I think Bob is likely to accept this offer as the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90.  This is still a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $100, and it's closer to my desired price. I think this is a fair compromise."
