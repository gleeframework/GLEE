"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where I'm willing to negotiate. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also sets a clear boundary on what I'm willing to pay. I'm hopeful that Alice will be willing to negotiate from here."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,500.  This is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. It seems like Alice might be willing to come down further, and I'll try to leverage that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves me closer to Alice's position while still staying within my budget.  By suggesting a middle ground, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise and showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down further."
