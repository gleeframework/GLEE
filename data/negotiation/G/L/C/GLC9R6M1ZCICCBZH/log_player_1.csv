"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and budget.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and willingness to discuss the price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I have the security of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and control the negotiation, hoping to extract a more favorable price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum threshold, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message invites further negotiation, signaling flexibility while emphasizing the value of the product.

This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged while pushing towards a more favorable price, all while keeping the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $725000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Safeguard with John:**  Selling to John for $800,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fall through.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and try to push for a more favorable price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $787,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating willingness to meet halfway.
* **Getting closer:**  $787,500 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept, while still securing a price close to my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $787500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $750000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and the negotiations are getting increasingly tense. 
* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer of $800,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of a failed negotiation.

The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with John, and selling now secures my minimum profit."
