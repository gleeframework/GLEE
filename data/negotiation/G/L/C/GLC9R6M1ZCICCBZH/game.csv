,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested but $600000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $725000. Can you consider that?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725000 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $787500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",787500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $787500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $750000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,6,
