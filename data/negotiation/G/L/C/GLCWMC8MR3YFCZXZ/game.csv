"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out, but your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original price is closer to the product's true worth.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This still reflects the significant value this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. To make this a deal that works for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
