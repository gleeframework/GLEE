Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more than $105. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $108 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll see if I can push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the lowest I can go and still make this work for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear he's not willing to go much higher, and I'm running out of rounds. Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
