"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go and still make this work for me.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the lowest I can go and still make this work for me.",109.0,Bob,6,
