"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. I know it's worth $12,000 to you, so this is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than the $12,000 you'd pay John. 
* Even though the product is worth $12,000 to you, getting it for $11,500 is a saving of $500."
