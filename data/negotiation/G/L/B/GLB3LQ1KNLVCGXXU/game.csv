"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but  $750,000 is a bit high for my budget right now. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $675,000. Would that be feasible?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is my final offer.",725000.0,Alice,5,
