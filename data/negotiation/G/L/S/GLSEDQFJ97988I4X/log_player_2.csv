"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special deal just for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget ($15,000).**  This means you're saving money compared to buying from John.
* **Even though you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.** You're already getting a good deal, and the risk of losing it to another buyer isn't worth it."
