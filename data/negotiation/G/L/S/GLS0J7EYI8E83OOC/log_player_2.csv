"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It makes no sense to accept it. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for a price you can afford, so rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to counteroffer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and hopefully, it's enough to entice Alice to sell. If she rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,500. This is a compromise, but it's still within my budget. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price than my previous offer.  If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,500. I'm going to counteroffer again, and if she rejects, I'll buy from John.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to be decisive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time to $8,750. This is a significant compromise, but it's still below my absolute maximum. We're running out of rounds, and I want to see if Alice will meet me halfway. If she rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm not willing to go above $8,750. We only have a few rounds left, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to buy from John, as it's the most financially sensible choice at this point. It's a bit disappointing to not get a better deal, but it's still within my budget and guarantees that I can acquire the product."
