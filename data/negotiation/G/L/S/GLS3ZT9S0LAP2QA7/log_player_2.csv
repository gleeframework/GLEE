# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John is asking for $15,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $15,000, so $12,000 is a good deal. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
