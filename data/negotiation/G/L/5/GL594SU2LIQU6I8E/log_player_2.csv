"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to get the best price, and $120 is still higher than your ideal price. Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
