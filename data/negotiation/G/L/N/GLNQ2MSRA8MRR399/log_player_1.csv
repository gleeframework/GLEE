"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the perceived value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and start a negotiation, showing flexibility.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob immediately accepts, I've made a good first move.
* **Set the tone for negotiation:**  I'm setting a starting point that's high enough to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leave room to adjust:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price in subsequent rounds, while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $5,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:**  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, even with 10 rounds remaining. It's better to try to get a better price or sell to John.
* **Counteroffer in the next round:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for negotiation. 

**Note:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you've stated. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer of $9,000.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning behind the counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also highlighting the value of the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm using language that emphasizes a desire for a compromise, making the offer feel less rigid.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Towards My Goal:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's significantly closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit. 
* **Leaving Room for More:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can further lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though we've made some progress, it's not yet close enough to what I'm willing to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, even with several rounds remaining. 
* **Counteroffer in the next round:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for negotiation. 

**Note:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $6,500 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $8,000?  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer of $8,000.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm reiterating that I appreciate his attempts to find a compromise but still pushing for a higher price. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a fair deal for both parties.
* **Finality:**  While I'm still open to negotiation, I'm starting to signal that this may be my final offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price.
* **Leaving Room to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm ready to sell to John, as I'm running out of rounds and don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
