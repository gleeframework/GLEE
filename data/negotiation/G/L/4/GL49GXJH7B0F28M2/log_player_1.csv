Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a good starting point, and there's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget.

While I could push for more, accepting $1,800,000 is a solid deal. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether."
