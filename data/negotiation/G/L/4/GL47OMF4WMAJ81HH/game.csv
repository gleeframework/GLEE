"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to acquire the product at a price below its true value to you while still ensuring I receive a favorable return.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
