,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",100.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still set on the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. I'm making a final compromise, and I think this price is a good balance between what I need to make and what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $80. I'm going to make one last offer, and that's $92. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. After this, I'll have to consider other options.",92.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence, but I must adhere to my budget. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $80.
