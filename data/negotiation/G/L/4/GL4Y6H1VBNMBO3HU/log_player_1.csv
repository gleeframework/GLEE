Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  This represents a significant value to you, given its worth to you is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,150,000 as the offer price. This is a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000). 
* **Message:** The message is designed to be persuasive and highlights the value proposition for Bob. It emphasizes the potential for a good deal for him and avoids appearing overly aggressive. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer while still securing a profitable sale for myself."
