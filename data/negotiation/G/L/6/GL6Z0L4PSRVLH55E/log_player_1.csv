Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is $3,000 higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, making it a potential win for you. However, it's still lower than the price John is willing to pay, meaning you don't lose out if Bob rejects the offer.  This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a chance to sell the product to Bob."
