"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I appreciate the product's potential, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I initially proposed, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1700000, reflecting the unique value proposition of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1700000 is closer, it's still outside my acceptable range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear your perspective and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $800000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to make another concession.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1600000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but reflects the unique value this product can bring to your business. Let's work together to finalize a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
