"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,750. This is my final offer, as I need to consider my own profit margin. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's my absolute limit. I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
