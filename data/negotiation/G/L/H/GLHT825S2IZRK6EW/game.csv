"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,125,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep the negotiation going, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
