Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could discuss a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $1200000 to you.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,300,000, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,400,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'll reject Bob's offer.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not yet willing to settle for $1,280,000.  I'll counter with a price that's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his target."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,250,000. I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob if I continue to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to go much higher, and I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking him walking away completely."
