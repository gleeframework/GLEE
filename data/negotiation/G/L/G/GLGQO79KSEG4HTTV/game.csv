"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? It's the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me.",9800.0,Bob,4,
