# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer you the product for $13,000, which is a small premium that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $12,000. I have 5 rounds left and believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer you the product for $12,750, which is a small premium that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting Alice to come down to my price are slim. To avoid losing more time and risking a worse outcome, I'll take the guaranteed price of $12,000 from John."
