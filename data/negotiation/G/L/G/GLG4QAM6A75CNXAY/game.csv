"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price point. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's try to find some middle ground.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $15,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,5,
