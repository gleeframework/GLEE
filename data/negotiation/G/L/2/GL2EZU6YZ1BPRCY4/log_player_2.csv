"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. How about $9,000?  I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$9,500 is a good price for you, and you're still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.  It's also likely that Alice won't come down further, as you're already at $1,500 above her minimum price."
