"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $16,000 is still above his budget. He can get the product from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
