Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,900. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11900}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above $12,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose money if he declines."
