"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while also giving Bob a good deal since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would ideally get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is still a good profit and a much better deal than selling to John. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and settling for John's offer."
