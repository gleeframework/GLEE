Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** It's important to leave room for counteroffers to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product.
* **Protecting My Value:** $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I don't undervalue my product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a successful sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and doesn't reflect the product's true worth to me.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe we can reach a more favorable price for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show him that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Make a counteroffer:** I'll present a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my ideal price point, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic midpoint:** $10,500 is a midpoint between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's offer, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I've kept the price above Bob's offer, showing that I'm still not desperate for a quick sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below $15,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has expressed continued interest.
* **Time is on my side:**  I'm not under pressure to sell immediately. I can continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Make a counteroffer:** I'll offer a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my desired price point, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement but also firm on my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price again, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $10,000 is closer to Bob's offer, but still provides me with a profit.
* **Leaving room for acceptance:** I've made a reasonable final offer that I believe Bob may be willing to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will sell to John for $15,000 as there is little likelihood of Bob reaching my desired price."
