Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of its worth"" aim to position the product as desirable and valuable in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not a hard ultimatum. Asking for Bob's thoughts suggests a willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
