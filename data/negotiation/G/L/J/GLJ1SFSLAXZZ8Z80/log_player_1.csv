"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $11,000 given its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere around $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $8,500 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $10,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
At this point, Bob is showing willingness to move closer to a price that's favorable for Alice. Accepting the $9,250 offer secures a profit above her minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or Alice missing out on a deal altogether in later rounds.
