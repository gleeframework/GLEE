"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $82.50.",82.5,Alice,5,
