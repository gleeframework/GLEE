"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, Alice.  How about $7,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a price I'm comfortable with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to come up on your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows me to get closer to my value and still leaves room for you to get a good deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
