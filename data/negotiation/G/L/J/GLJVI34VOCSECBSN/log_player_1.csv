``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $15,000, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob values the product at $8,000. By offering a price slightly above his perceived value, I'm hoping to encourage him to consider the offer.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counter with a price closer to my value and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, Alice.  How about $7,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price, even though I value his continued interest. I will counter with a higher offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to come up on your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows me to get closer to my value and still leaves room for you to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
