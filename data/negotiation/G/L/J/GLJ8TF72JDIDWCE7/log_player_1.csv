Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation. It's significantly less than my minimum ($1,000,000) but considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my confidence in it, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters, allowing me to potentially secure an even higher price."
