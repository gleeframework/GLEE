"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a better alternative with John, so there's no risk in rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and you're willing to pay up to $10,000. This counteroffer represents your maximum value and leaves no room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter with a price closer to $10,000, but you're prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she might not come down any more, and you'll end up buying from John at $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you the hassle of further negotiation and still gets you the product at a good price."
