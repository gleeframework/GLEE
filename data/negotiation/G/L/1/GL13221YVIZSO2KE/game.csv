"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $80 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate. However, I need to maintain a certain price point to ensure profitability. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $105 for the product. This allows me to cover costs while still being competitive. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
