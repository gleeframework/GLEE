"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair considering the value you place on the product and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I value your interest, the product's worth to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000 and leaves a comfortable profit margin for Alice.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate."
