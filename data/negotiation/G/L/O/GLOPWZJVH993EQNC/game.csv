"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $1600000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1900000. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $1700000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. Let's try $1850000. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,7,
