"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer, and I think the value of the product justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $11200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the worth in it. Let me know what you think.",11200.0,Alice,5,
