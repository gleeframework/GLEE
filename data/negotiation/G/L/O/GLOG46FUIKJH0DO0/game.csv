"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for someone like yourself. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product but $2,250,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and call it $1,550,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,400,000.  It's a strong offer and I think it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
