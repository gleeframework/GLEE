"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still below its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700,000 is still below the value I have in mind. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
