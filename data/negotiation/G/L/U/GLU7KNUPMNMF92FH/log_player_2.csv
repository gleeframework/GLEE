"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since the product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. How about we start with $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for a back-and-forth process.  The $75 price point allows for some room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's maximum value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target value. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still trying to get a lower price, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise. He's proposing a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates that he's taking the negotiation seriously and is willing to meet Alice halfway."
