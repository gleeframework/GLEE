Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still giving you a good profit margin above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting value and not dwelling on the price itself. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style or how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the starting price."
