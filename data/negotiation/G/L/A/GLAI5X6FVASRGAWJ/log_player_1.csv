Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $14,000 allows for a potential profit of $2,000 (above your minimum).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he desires, still keeping the price above your minimum acceptable amount.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. By pricing it closer to his perceived value, the offer increases the likelihood of acceptance and a higher profit than selling to John."
