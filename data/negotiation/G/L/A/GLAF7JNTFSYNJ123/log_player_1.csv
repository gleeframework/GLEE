{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking to get at least $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get more. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is the absolute minimum I'd accept, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my initial asking price of $150. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $135. I was thinking more like $125. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's worth accepting to avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
