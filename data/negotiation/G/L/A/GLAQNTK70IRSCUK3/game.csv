"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $775000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
