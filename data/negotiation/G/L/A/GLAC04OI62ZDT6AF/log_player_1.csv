{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000.  I believe it's a fantastic value and would be a great asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds and the potential it offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's proposal. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a profitable price point. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit above that. Can you meet me at $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and  closer to my desired amount.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is higher.  It's best to secure a profitable sale now."
