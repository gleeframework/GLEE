"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $16,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good deal, but $16,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the final price I'm willing to consider.",15000.0,Alice,5,
