"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his $10,000 limit. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $16,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good deal, but $16,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the final price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice is holding firm at $15,000, which is still above Bob's limit.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point, and saves him the time and energy of further negotiation."
