Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you really want the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $140?

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your limit. You're happy to pay up to $100, and you can always get the product from John for that price. You'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get her down to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle of $110 and $140, at $127.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, $127.50 is still above your limit. You're still willing to negotiate further, and you can always purchase the product from John if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. Can you meet me at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $120 is still above your maximum budget of $100. While you're happy to negotiate and have come close to a deal, it's clear Alice is not willing to go any lower.  You've successfully negotiated her down from $180 to $120, which is a great outcome!  However, your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John offers a guaranteed price of $100. You'll take advantage of this reliable option and buy the product from John."
