"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's starting offer is her ideal price.  There's no reason for me to accept it right away when I have other options that could save me money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives me room to move upwards while staying below my $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message is polite and expresses continued interest, which is important for keeping the negotiation going. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** I'm not revealing my absolute top price yet, which keeps me in a stronger negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can offer you a compromise at $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my alternative option of buying from John for $10,000. This suggests there might be room for further negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, I want to gauge how firm Alice is on her price. If she's truly motivated to sell, she might be willing to come down a bit more. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have the safety net of buying from John at $10,000, so I'm not in a rushed position to accept a price I'm not completely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By proposing $9,000, I'm aiming for a compromise that splits the difference between her current offer ($9,500) and my previous offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still moving towards a price I find acceptable. 
* **Emphasizing Budget:** I'm reiterating that my budget is a constraint, which might make Alice more willing to accept a lower price rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is below my maximum, but close enough that I can still accept Alice's counteroffer if she comes down slightly, keeping me under my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Price:** Alice has come down to $9,250, which is below my $10,000 maximum and a significant saving compared to her original offer.
* **Minimal Further Gains:**  While I might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be much lower than $9,250. The potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice walking away or the time spent on further negotiation.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now ensures I get the product at a price I'm happy with."
