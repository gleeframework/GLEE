Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to $10,000 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $10,500?  This price allows me to get closer to your offer, while still getting a reasonable value for my product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept $9,500, I'm still within range of my desired price, and I believe I can get a bit closer to $10,000 with a counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can we meet in the middle one more time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting close to my minimum, but the negotiations are taking a lot of time, and there's no guarantee that he'll eventually agree to my price.  It's better to take the sure thing with John."
