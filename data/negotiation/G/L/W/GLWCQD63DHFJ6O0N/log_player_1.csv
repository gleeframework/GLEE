Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is still a significant amount for me. I hope we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1250000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  I'm sure we can find a way to bridge the gap.

Bob's offer:
