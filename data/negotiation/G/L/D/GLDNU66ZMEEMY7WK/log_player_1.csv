Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your operations. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit. I've also included a message to build rapport and highlight the product's value. This first offer sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's important to remember my goal is to maximize my profit. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to come closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I believe we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product for $987,500. This way we both get a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, signaling my willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the willingness to compromise.  How about $950,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've had 6 rounds of negotiation, and it's getting late in the game.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower offer than John's is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a good price, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
