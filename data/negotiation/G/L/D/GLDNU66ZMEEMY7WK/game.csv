"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer the product for $987,500. This way we both get a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the willingness to compromise.  How about $950,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
