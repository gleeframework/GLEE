"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do  $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a significant value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
