Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do  $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still gives you a significant value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
