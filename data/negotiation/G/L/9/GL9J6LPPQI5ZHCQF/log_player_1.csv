Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob not reaching a price point that's beneficial for me, especially with time constraints. It's more strategic to cut my losses and accept John's offer, ensuring I receive the full value I place on the product."
