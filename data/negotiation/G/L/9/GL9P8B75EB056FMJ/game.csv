"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $145, which is still a great deal for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, though. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $145, Bob. I think that's a very reasonable price for this product, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins. If you're not willing to meet me at $145, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",145.0,Alice,7,
