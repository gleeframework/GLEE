Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better understanding of his perceived value of the product.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe the product has a higher value and want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but still hold the value of the product in high regard. This could incentivize Bob to raise his offer closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer and is closer to my desired value.  While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, accepting his offer guarantees a sale that's significantly better than selling to John.  Further negotiation might not yield a higher price, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high."
