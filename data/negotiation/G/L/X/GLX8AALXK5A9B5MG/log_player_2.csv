"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Alice's offer of $700,000 is less than your maximum price of $800,000 and significantly less than buying from John. This is a good deal!"
