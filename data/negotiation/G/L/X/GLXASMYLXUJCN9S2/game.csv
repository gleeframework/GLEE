"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can't justify paying that much.  I'm willing to offer you $600000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1.5M is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1200000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my range.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $600000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $900000 for the product. I'm thinking we can find a sweet spot in between my previous offer and your offer. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm thinking we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $850000. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
