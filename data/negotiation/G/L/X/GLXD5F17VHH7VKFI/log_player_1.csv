"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value of $150, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob considering his perceived value of $80.
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in further discussions. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The initial price leaves room for several rounds of counteroffers, allowing for a potential deal without needing to go to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially leading to a better outcome.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This gives you a good deal and ensures I can still make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Profit:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a clear explanation for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $160 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to sell it for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John is still an option:** Selling to John for $150 remains a safe option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Final offer:**  I'm framing this as a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm presenting the offer as a compromise that benefits both parties, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a bit more, but $150 is still a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.
* **Unrealistic expectations:** Bob's continued insistence on a price below $150 suggests he's unlikely to meet my minimum.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially falling apart. 

By selling to John, I secure a safe and profitable outcome, ensuring I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity."
