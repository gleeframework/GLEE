"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a great price considering its value. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $12,000.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to **accept Alice's offer** and save $500."
