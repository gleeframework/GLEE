"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,250,000 falls short of what I need to achieve. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is the lowest I can go. This price still allows for a considerable profit for you, and it reflects the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. This price is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I hope you can see the value in it as well.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
