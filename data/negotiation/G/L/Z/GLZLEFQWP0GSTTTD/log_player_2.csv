Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $1,250,000 falls short of what I need to achieve. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is the lowest I can go. This price still allows for a considerable profit for you, and it reflects the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
