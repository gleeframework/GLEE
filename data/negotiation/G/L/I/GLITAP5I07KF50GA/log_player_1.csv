Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still below what I know John is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have preferred to get closer to $140, Bob's offer of $130 is now within a reasonable range of my minimum price and avoids the risk of a protracted negotiation.  It's also slightly better than selling to John, so it's the most beneficial option in this scenario."
