Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I believe it's a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($100) to leave some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while also keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below my minimum desired value of $100.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?  It's still a fair price for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $90, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum desired value of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Bob while maintaining a decent profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, and I'd rather take that certainty than risk further negotiation with Bob."
