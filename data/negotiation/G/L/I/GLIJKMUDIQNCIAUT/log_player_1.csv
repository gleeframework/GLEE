Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 is a price point that's likely to be attractive to Bob (as it's significantly above his perceived value) while still netting me a good profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, the slightly higher price leaves me some wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer."
