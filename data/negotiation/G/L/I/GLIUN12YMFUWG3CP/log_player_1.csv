Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a reasonable offer you can send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference we can work with.

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept but also maximizes your profit. Aiming too high risks him rejecting the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time"" to create a sense of value and urgency.
* **Price:** The offered price of $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, a strong incentive to accept. This price also secures you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly if Bob counters. However, don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum â€“ you have a guaranteed buyer!"
