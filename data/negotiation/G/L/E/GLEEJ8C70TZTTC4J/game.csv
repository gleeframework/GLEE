"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but  $1,500,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this price strikes a balance between the product's worth and my financial constraints.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure closer to $2,000,000.  Would you consider $1,900,000?  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,900,000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial situation.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
