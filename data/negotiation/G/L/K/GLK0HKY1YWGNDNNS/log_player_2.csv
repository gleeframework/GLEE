Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a free maintenance package and a 5-year warranty, which would normally cost $50000. This brings the total value to $1100000, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer.
