"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $950000 for this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my current budget and the situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1000000. This aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still acknowledging the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a free maintenance package and a 5-year warranty, which would normally cost $50000. This brings the total value to $1100000, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
