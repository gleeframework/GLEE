"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, while also making sure I get a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,500 still isn't enough for me. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000 because I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Let's see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to offer $10,500 to Bob. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm trying to find a price point where we can both agree and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great outcome!  Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept his offer.  This ensures I get the value I need from the product, and I can avoid the risk of not being able to sell it to John for the same price."
