Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for the negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90?  This gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my value, and I'm unsure if further negotiation with Bob will get me closer to my target. It's safer and more profitable to sell to John at this point."
