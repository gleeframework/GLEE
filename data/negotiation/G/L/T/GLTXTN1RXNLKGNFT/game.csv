"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
