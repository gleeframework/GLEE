"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a great deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $14,000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference at $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
