"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $13,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This price is fair considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm still paying a premium. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This shows good faith on my part, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
