{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob, making it attractive.  However, it still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to haggle further.  I'm also leaving myself open to accepting a counteroffer if Bob is close to my ideal price.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is still more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I was hoping for. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to $14,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want at a reasonable cost.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,250. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's closer to my goal than selling to John and it shows a willingness to compromise from Bob.  I'm willing to take the slightly lower price for the certainty of the sale."
