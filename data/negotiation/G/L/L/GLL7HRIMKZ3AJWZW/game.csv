"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want at a reasonable cost.  What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,250. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
