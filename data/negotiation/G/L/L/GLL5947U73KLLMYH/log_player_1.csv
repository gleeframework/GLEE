Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price, before needing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute bottom line.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to your bottom line, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $98 is tempting, I'm still determined to get to my desired $100.  There are a couple of rounds left and I'm confident I can close the deal with Bob or, if not, I can still sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. I'm still committed to selling the product for at least $100. I understand your concerns, but this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at $100, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're committed to selling the product for $100, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to pay $97 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I don't think I can convince Bob to pay my desired $100.  While $97 is close, I'd rather secure the sale with John for $120, which is a much better deal for me."
