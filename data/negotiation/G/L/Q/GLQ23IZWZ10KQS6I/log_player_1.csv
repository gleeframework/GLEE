Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant amount.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to perceive a deal if he values it even slightly higher.
* **Strong Opening:**  This offer signals that I understand the product's worth and am serious about selling it, but also willing to negotiate to a point."
