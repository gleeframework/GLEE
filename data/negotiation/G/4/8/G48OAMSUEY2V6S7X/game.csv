"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, reflecting the value you'll get out of it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000, which I believe is closer to what I can afford while still providing a fair return for you. I hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below the minimum I can accept. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my true value, and allows for a fair return for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer of $1,050,000, and while it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to meet that price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000, which I believe is closer to what you're looking for while staying within my budget. I hope this helps us move forward towards a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 still doesn't meet my minimum. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,025,000. This is a compromise that reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've carefully considered your latest offer of $1,025,000, and I would like to propose an offer of $1,010,000. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,010,000 simply doesn't work for me. We're very close now, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,017,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1017500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've thought about your offer of $1,017,500 and I would like to propose an offer of $1,010,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can find common ground and conclude this negotiation successfully.",1010000.0,Bob,8,
