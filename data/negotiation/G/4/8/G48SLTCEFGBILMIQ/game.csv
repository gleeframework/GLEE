"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. This reflects the true value and potential I see it bringing to your business.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of the product. While I appreciate your perspective,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential impact for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see we're getting closer, but $900,000 remains below what I consider a fair deal. It undervalues the potential this product holds. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,000,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your investment. Let's close this, what do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a price that reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution.  However, I need to be upfront â€“  $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down to $975,000.  However, that's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $925,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Bob,8,
