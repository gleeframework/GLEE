"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. This reflects the true value and potential I see it bringing to your business.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's far above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of the product. While I appreciate your perspective,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential impact for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While she has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see we're getting closer, but $900,000 remains below what I consider a fair deal. It undervalues the potential this product holds. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,000,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your investment. Let's close this, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down to $1,000,000, it is still above Bob's budget.  Bob has a few more rounds to try to get the price closer to his target of $800,000, and by rejecting the offer, he can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a price that reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution.  However, I need to be upfront â€“  $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. He has a few more rounds to negotiate and hopefully get the price down further.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and negotiate a better deal.  

**Important Consideration:**  Bob is running out of time. If he can't get a price below $975,000 in the next few rounds, he should seriously consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down to $975,000.  However, that's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $925,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
