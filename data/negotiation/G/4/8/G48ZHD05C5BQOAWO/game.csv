"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
