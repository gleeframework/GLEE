Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more favorable price. I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $1,050,000?  This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired price. I have 6 rounds remaining and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6 and Bob is offering $1,050,000.  This is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While there are 4 rounds remaining,  I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to increase his offer significantly, given his comments about budget constraints.  Given that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, it's more advantageous to accept that offer and secure a sale at my desired price."
