Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for potential haggling if Bob wants to negotiate further.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between your minimum and his maximum makes the offer seem more reasonable and could increase the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering a price significantly lower than $150 increases the chance Bob will accept, guaranteeing a sale rather than risking him rejecting it and settling for John's $100 offer."
