"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and is a fair offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
