It's too expensive right now. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with $8,500. It's still above my ideal price, but hopefully, it's closer to what Alice is willing to accept."

Alice is pushing the price up, so I'm going to keep pushing back down.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}

I'm lowering my offer again to $8,200.  This is getting close to my limit, but I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about getting this product and come down to a reasonable price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice isn't budging on her price and it seems we're at an impasse.  I'm going to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's the best I can do at this point."
