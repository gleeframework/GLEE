Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, her guaranteed price from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below her fallback ensures potential for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Create Urgency:** High initial price might encourage Bob to act quickly, especially if he perceives the product as valuable. 

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of either securing a deal close to her desired price or moving on to John without wasting time."
