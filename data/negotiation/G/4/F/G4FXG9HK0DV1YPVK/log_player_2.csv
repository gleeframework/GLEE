"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
