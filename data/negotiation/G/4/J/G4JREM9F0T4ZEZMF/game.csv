"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for a great product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $125? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $125 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best deal I can offer, and I think it's a fair price for a great product. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
