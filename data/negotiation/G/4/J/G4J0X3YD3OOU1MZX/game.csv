"Thank you for the offer, Alice. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $145? That's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.",145.0,Bob,4,
