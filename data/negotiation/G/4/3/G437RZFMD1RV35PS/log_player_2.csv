I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000.

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $1,000,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap sufficiently.  It's time to cut bait and go with John's guaranteed offer."
