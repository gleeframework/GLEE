"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I think $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
