Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has now offered $850,000 twice. This indicates he is unlikely to go significantly higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of losing a significant amount of money.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and take the secure deal with John."
