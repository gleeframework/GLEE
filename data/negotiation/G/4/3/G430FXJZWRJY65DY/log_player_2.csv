"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above my ideal target of saving as much as possible. I'll counter with a lower offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $115? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is getting closer to my target. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
