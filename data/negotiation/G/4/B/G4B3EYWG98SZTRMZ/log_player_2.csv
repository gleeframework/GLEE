Alice's offer is far too high.  It's best to reject and start negotiating."

I'm starting with my maximum price point of $8,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer and allows for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to come down."

While $15,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $10,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still sticking to my limit."

I'm going to offer $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully Alice will be willing to accept. If not, I'll likely go with John's offer."
