"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle to reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
