Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the price is justified without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than its worth to him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't want to reveal this to Bob immediately.  It's stronger to present the offer with a sense of opportunity and scarcity. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal with Bob."
