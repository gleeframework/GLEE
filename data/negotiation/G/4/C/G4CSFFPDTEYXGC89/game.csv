"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $16000? That's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
