"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, so I'm offering it to you for a very reasonable price of $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice believes the product is worth $80 to you, her offer of $120 is significantly higher than your budget and what John offers. You can save $40 by going with John."
