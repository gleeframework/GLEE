Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for both of us. It gives Bob a decent discount from the product's worth to him, while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still a decent profit for me, and it seems like he's willing to negotiate further.  Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
