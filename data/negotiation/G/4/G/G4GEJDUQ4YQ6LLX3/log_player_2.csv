"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We start by countering with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This gives us some room for negotiation and helps gauge her willingness to lower the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $105, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down on her price, but it's still above our target. We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We are moving closer to a potential deal.  By offering $95, we are splitting the difference between her previous offer and our last counter-offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can see that you're willing to pay $95, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to her lowest price, which is her value for the product.  We're unlikely to get a better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. It's a good time to accept the offer."
