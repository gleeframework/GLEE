I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a rare opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider the value of the product. I can do $1750000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $1600000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000, and I'm starting to think that's where we should meet. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $50000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1500000 with the added extras?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
