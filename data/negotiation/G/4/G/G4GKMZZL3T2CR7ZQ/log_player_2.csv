Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $112.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $118.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I'm already in round 5. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm concerned I won't be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100, as it's within my budget and a guaranteed deal."
