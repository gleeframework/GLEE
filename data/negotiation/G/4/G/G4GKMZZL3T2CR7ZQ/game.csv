"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $112.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $118.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",118.0,Alice,5,
