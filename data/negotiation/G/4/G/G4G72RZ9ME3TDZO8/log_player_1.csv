"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and establish a strong starting point for negotiation. If Bob is truly interested in the product, he may be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer.  

This strategy also allows me to assess if Bob is a serious buyer or simply trying to lowball me.  If he rejects this offer outright, I might consider moving on to John as a safer option."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe there is more room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will allow me to test the waters and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,650,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate, but it still reflects the significant value of the product. 

By making a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price, I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm confident in the product's worth and that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. This strategy will allow me to continue exploring potential deal points with Bob while still maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,550,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and significantly higher than what John is offering.  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting closer to the end of the process. I'm happy with this outcome and want to avoid risking the sale by continuing to negotiate."
