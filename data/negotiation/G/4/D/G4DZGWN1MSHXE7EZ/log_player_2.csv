"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's beneficial to both of us. I'm confident that this product will be a significant asset for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget and a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether or going over budget. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing out."
