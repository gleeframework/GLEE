Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
