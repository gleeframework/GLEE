"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's get this deal done.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
