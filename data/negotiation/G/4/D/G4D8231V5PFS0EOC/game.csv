"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $900000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $850000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",920000.0,Alice,5,
