"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can accept. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can seal the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
