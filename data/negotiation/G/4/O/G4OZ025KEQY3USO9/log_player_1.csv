Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.

This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.
