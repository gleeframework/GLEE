"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to making this deal work, but I can't go any higher than $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's bridge this gap and reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
