"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to making this deal work, but I can't go any higher than $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still outside of Bob's budget. He is getting close to his maximum, but he should continue to negotiate. There is still room to bargain and possibly reach an acceptable price within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's bridge this gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still outside of Bob's budget of $800,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high. To guarantee getting the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy it from John at $800,000."
