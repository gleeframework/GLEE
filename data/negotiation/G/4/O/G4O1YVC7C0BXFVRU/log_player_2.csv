Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $850,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do without going below my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation.  You're better off taking the sure deal with John."
