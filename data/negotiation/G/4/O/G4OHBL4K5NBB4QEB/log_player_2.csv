"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that I believe would be of great value to your business.  While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John."
