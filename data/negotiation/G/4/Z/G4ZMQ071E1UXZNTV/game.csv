"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I can do $110 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me. How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $120 to $110 and then to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, so I'll offer it to you for $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Alice,5,
