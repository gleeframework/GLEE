"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the special features. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $85. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to get the product I want.",85.0,Bob,4,
