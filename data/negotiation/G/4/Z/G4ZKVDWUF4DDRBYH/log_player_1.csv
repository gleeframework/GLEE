Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases your chances of a quick deal.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Don't start at your absolute highest price. Give Bob a little wiggle room to feel like he's getting a slight discount. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,180,000. This is a fantastic deal on something I know you'll benefit greatly from."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable Price:** $1,180,000 leaves Bob with a $20,000 gain, which is likely enough to incentivize him to buy.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price as a special opportunity. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate down slightly. You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't feel pressured to accept anything below your $1,000,000 minimum."
