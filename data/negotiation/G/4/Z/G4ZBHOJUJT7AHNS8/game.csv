"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this work.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $1,550,000. This would be a good compromise, as it's closer to your offer but still allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's make this happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
