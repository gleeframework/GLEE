"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $11,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great deal.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
