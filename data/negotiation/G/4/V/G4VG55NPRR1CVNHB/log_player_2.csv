Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $6,500. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make another slight adjustment. How about we meet at $6,425? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.

It's clear that Alice is very reluctant to move significantly from her initial offers.  While she's making small concessions, it's unlikely she'll reach my $6,000 budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to ensure I get the product."
