"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However,  $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product without going over my limit.",10650.0,Bob,4,
