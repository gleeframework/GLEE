Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I believe I can convince Bob to go higher, or at least find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing him that I'm willing to negotiate. By emphasizing the value and the ""great deal"" aspect, I'm hoping to convince him to accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. How about we meet at $87? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $87. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and the negotiation seems to be getting more difficult.  There's a risk that if I reject again, Bob might walk away completely or offer something lower, leaving me with only the $80 option from John.  It's better to secure a sale now at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
