"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer.  What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $15,750, but I have to say that I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the price I'd be willing to accept from John. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,5,
