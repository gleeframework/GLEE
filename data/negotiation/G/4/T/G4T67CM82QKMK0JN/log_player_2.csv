"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $800,000. We believe this is a competitive offer, and we're confident you'll find it hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's likely there's room for negotiation.  It's always best to try to get a better price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not quite ready to accept $950,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product at $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still slightly lower than my counteroffer of $950,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'd prefer to try to get a little closer to my ideal price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still not quite there at $900,000. I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to meet you at $915,000. We think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $925,000. It's a good deal considering my budget of $1,200,000 and the fact that I can still save $285,000. It's time to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations or buying from John at a higher price."
