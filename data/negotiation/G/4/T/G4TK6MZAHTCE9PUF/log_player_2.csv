"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get the product for $8,000 from John, so we should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful while clearly indicating that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to our ideal price ($8,000) but still gives us some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but it's still above what John is offering. We have some leverage since we have a guaranteed option at $8,000. Let's counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're proposing a price match with John's offer, making our position clear.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing it as a ""tight budget,"" we imply that Alice might lose the sale if she doesn't accept.
* **Final Offer (For Now):** While this is our target, we can re-evaluate if Alice completely rejects this counteroffer."
