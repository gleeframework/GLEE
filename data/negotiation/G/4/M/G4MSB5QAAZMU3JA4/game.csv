"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little more than I can comfortably pay.  How about $155?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $157.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement.",157.5,Alice,5,
