"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1250000? It's a fair price, and still well within your budget. Let's make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $1150000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop to $1200000. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
