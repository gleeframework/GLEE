"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting with a price that leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  However, I'm always prepared to walk away and get my minimum of $15,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is only slightly better than John's offer.  With limited rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a lower price.  I'll accept this offer and secure a profit."
