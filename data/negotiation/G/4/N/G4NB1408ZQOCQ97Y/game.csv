"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but it's a bit closer to your desired price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
