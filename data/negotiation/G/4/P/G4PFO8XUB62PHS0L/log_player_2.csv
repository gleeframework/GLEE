"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking for a product worth no more than $150, and Alice's initial offer of $120 is within that range. However, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $110. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $110, which is still a decent price, but you're trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and could potentially get the price down further. There are still 7 rounds left, so you have time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. After that, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is only $8 more than your initial counteroffer of $100. You've made significant progress and there's a good chance that you won't be able to get a better price.  Since you have a time limit and you're trying to save money, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision in this round."
