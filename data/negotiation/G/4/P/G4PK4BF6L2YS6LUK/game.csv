"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me. However, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can meet you halfway at $90. Would you be willing to meet me there?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $75. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer you a slight discount at $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is just a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,7,
