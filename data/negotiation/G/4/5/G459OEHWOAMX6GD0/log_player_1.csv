"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's far below the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise, but let's find a price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from it.  I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm serious about buying it, but $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$925,000 is still too low for me, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $925,000 is still not enough.  I'm offering $975,000. This is a very fair price considering the benefits you will receive from this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
