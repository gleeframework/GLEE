"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's worth a substantial amount, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $2000000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value of this product,  $1500000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit below my target. Considering the value of the product and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
