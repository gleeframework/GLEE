Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.
