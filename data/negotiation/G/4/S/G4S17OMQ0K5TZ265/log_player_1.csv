{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation of $120, making it potentially attractive. However, it's still below my minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum value of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low. John is offering a price that meets my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
