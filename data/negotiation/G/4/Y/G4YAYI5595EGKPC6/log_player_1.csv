Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high allows me to potentially secure the highest possible profit. Even if Bob counters, it opens room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a strong fallback position. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Slight Discount Psychology:**  Offering the product for slightly less than my guaranteed sale price to John might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal."
