"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a small premium over your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",825000.0,Alice,5,
