While $110 is better than $120, it's still over your budget of $80. You'll reject the offer and try to get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$105 is still a bit too high for you. While you're getting closer to your target price, you'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to come down to $98?  That's as high as I can go."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've negotiated for a few rounds, but Alice isn't coming down to a price you're comfortable with. You've reached a point where you're likely to spend more than your budget and the risk of going through more rounds isn't worth it.  It's time to go with John's offer."
