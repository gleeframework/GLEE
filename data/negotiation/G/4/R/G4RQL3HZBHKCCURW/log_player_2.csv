"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm only willing to pay $10,500.  This price is fair considering the product's value, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, I must maintain my minimum price to ensure profitability. I am willing to negotiate further, but I cannot go below $11,000 for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.**
* **While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.**
* **Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation.**"
