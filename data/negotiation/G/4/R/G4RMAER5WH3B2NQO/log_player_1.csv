"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find valuable. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than his perceived worth.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even if Bob counteroffers significantly lower, we're still in a good position to negotiate down towards a price above our minimum.

**Important:** It's crucial to remember we have the John option ($1,500,000 guaranteed). We'll need to weigh the potential of a higher price from Bob against the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount and closer to our minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob's willingness to counter with such a high number suggests there's room for him to go higher. We'll reject this offer to signal we're looking for a better deal and attempt to steer the negotiation closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe that's a fair reflection of its potential."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession ($200,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still aiming high, closer to $2,000,000,  to maintain a strong negotiating position.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's value, subtly pushing back against Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower.

We'll closely observe Bob's response in the next round to gauge his willingness to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We've successfully negotiated Bob up by $100,000 from his previous offer.
* **Time Value:**  We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,900,000 significantly exceeds our minimum price and the guaranteed offer from John. 

While it's possible we could extract a bit more from Bob, the risk of losing this deal and ending up with John's lower offer outweighs the potential reward. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
