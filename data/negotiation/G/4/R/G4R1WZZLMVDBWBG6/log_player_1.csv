Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $50,000 in perceived value ($800,000 value to him - $750,000 price). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a final sale price above John's offer. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the product's value to both Bob and myself while ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
