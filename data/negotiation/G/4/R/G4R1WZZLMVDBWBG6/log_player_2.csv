"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to stay within your budget."
