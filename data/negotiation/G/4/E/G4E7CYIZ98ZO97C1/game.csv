"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. ",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's find a middle ground.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to bargain, but $125 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? ",160.0,Alice,5,
