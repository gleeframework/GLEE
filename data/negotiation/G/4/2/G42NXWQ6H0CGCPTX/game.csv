"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussions, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $650,000?  That would be a fair compromise I think.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit.  I can meet you halfway at $700,000.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.  Please let me know.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value you'll get from it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
