Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and increases the potential profit if Bob accepts the initial offer. 
* **Understand Value:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($15,000) than our minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John ensures we won't be forced to accept anything below $8,000. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message frames the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
