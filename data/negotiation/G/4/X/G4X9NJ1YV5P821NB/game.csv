,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference and go with $130. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I've already gone as low as I'm comfortable with, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $132.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",132.5,Alice,5,
