{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm also not keen on losing out on $400,000 by selling to John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going down to my minimum acceptable price.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm taking a firmer stance. I'm hoping that Bob will finally come around and accept my offer. If not, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I've pushed for a higher price, but it's clear Bob is not willing to go any higher.  It's better to secure $1,500,000 than risk getting a lower price or having the negotiations drag on without a successful outcome."
