"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I have plenty of room to negotiate before approaching John's $15,000 fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer significantly below Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and aims to gauge her flexibility.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By offering Alice's perceived value of the product, I'm seeing if she's willing to sell at a price that's highly beneficial to me. 
* **Prepared to Negotiate:** Even if she rejects this initial counteroffer, it sets the stage for me to gradually increase my offer while staying well below John's $15,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $10,500 is still significantly higher than her perceived value of $8,000. I have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Strategic Increment:** The $1,500 increase from my previous offer signals that I'm serious but also maintaining a firm stance.
* **Room for Maneuvering:**  This counteroffer keeps me well below both Alice's starting price and John's alternative, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Acceptable Price:**  While not ideal, $9,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. There's a risk Alice could walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price."
