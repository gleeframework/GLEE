"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to entice Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, but I'm not giving away too much. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a price that I believe is reasonable but still allows for potential negotiation. 
* By starting high and having a backup buyer (John), I'm in a good position to secure a price closer to my minimum value. 
* I'm also being strategic with my language to encourage Bob to engage and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** While $90 is closer to my minimum value of $120, it's still significantly lower.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate. 
* **Backup plan:** Selling to John is always an option if the negotiation fails.

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer to continue the negotiation and try to secure a better price.
* I'll use the knowledge that Bob is interested to leverage my position and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* Having John as a backup gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth a price closer to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire to earn more and the need to keep the negotiation going. 
* By showing willingness to compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept or counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open as a fallback if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** $92 is still below my minimum desired price of $120. 
* **Negotiation window:** There's still room for negotiation, and I have a good chance of getting closer to my target.
* **John is a safe alternative:**  I can always sell to John for $120 if the deal with Bob falls through.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to move closer to my desired price.
* I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I know I have a guaranteed sale with John.
*  I will continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone while staying firm on my position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence! I really appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us both. While $92 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $94. I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $2, demonstrating a willingness to be flexible while still working toward my desired price.
* **Reiterate fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintain positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

* I want to continue pushing Bob towards a higher price without risking losing him entirely.
* A small increment is less likely to be rejected than a larger jump, making it more likely he'll agree or counter with a slightly higher offer.
* I'm hoping this will eventually lead to a deal that's closer to my desired price point, but still allows me to maintain a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $91 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $91 is still below my minimum desired price of $120. 
* **Few rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and see if I can push for a better deal.
* **John is a safe option:** I can always sell to John for $120 if I don't get a better offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to move closer to my desired price.
* I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm already willing to go below my minimum.
* I'll be prepared to accept a deal slightly below my minimum if I feel like I'm not going to get a better offer.
* I'm also considering the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $91 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $93. This is a great product, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a final concession, showing that I'm trying to meet Bob halfway but have a limited amount of room to negotiate further.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to encourage him to see the worth in paying slightly more.
* **Limited time:** I'm subtly implying that time is running out, but without being overly pushy.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to pressure Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer before the rounds run out.
* I'm trying to find a balance between my desired price and maintaining a good relationship with Bob.
* If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John, but I'm still hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is my absolute maximum. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only two rounds left:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I need to make a decisive decision.
* **Low offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum price of $120.
* **John is a sure bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and it's the safest option with so little time remaining.

**Strategy:**

* With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to try and negotiate further with Bob. 
* I've made several concessions already, and Bob is unlikely to change his offer significantly. 
* Selling to John at $120 is the most financially responsible decision, even though it means losing the potential to build a relationship with Bob."
