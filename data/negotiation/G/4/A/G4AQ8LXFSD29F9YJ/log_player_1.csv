I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe this is a strong starting point that demonstrates the value I place on the product while still leaving room for compromise.  I'm confident that Bob will understand the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more than that. I'll counter with a lower price, but one that still reflects the value I place on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. I'm hopeful Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd still prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely. Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and a significant profit."
