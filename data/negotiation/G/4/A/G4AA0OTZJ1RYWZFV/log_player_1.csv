Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to agree to $1,100,000. Let's aim for a compromise of $1,075,000. I believe this offers a fair reflection of the product's value while respecting my budget.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear further negotiation will likely result in a price below John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
