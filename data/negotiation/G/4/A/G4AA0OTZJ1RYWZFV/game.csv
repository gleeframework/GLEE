"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary concerns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
