"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value highly, and I'm confident it's worth at least $100 to you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll reject the offer since Alice's price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
