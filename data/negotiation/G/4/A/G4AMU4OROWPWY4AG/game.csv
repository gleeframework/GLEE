"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it offers.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you as well.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and the benefits it offers, is significantly higher. I'm confident that you'll see a considerable return on this investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think.",880000.0,Bob,4,
