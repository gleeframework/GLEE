Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you as well.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and the benefits it offers, is significantly higher. I'm confident that you'll see a considerable return on this investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction."",

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think.
