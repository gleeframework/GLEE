Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" for Bob aims to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high potential profit and a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
