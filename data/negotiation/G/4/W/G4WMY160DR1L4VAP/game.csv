"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000, which is a $500 discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount at $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my perspective.",12500.0,Alice,5,
