"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, but it's worth a try to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $900,000 to $850,000.  While Bob could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to sell or that Bob will end up paying John $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
