"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be equally valuable for your business. My initial price is $1100000. I'm open to negotiating, but this is a fair starting point. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $950000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price.  How about $1050000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1050000. Would it be possible for you to consider $1025000 as a compromise?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
