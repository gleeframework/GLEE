Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be equally valuable for your business. My initial price is $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiating, but this is a fair starting point. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also signals that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for compromise. If Bob rejects the offer, I have the option to counteroffer or walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $950000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Message:** The message maintains a friendly tone while emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a fair deal. It also implies a willingness to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to negotiate further. It allows for a potential deal while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob still refuses, I can choose to sell to John or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1050000. Would it be possible for you to consider $1025000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's still lower than I'd prefer, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing out to John. 

**Strategy:**

Given the uncertainty of future negotiation outcomes and the risk of losing a sale to John, I've decided to accept Bob's offer.  This ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
