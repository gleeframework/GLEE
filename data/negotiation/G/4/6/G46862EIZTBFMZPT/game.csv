"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000. This is the minimum I can offer, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
