"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's significantly more than your maximum budget and even higher than its value to Alice. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a much lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget. You should continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target price."

 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end."",

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000. This is the minimum I can offer, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,200,000.  You'll save $100,000 and avoid potentially dragging out the negotiation further."
