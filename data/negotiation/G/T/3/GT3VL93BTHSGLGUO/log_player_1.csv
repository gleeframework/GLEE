Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to try and negotiate a better price with him.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to see a more substantial move to make this work. How about $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. It's the best price I can offer, and it's also my bottom line. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
