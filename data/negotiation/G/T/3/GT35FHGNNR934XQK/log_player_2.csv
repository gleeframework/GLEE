You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,000,000."
