"I appreciate your confidence in the product's worth, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for a product that's worth $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the price you're willing to sell it for.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a unique product, and I'm confident it's worth that price.  Let's finalize this deal at $1,000,000. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
