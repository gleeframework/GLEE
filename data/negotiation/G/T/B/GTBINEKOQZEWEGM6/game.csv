"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $17,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
