"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in this product, but I believe a price of $1,250,000 is more reasonable, given my budget and the market value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm confident it can significantly impact your business, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on this opportunity. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high, even though she came down a bit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
