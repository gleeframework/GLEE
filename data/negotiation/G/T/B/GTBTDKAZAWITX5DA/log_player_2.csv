"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not sure if I should accept the offer or not. If I accept the offer, I'll be paying $9,500, which is more than I'm willing to pay. On the other hand, if I reject the offer and buy the product from John, I can get it for $8,000, which is a better deal.
