Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly introduces a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would be back-and-forth communication allowing for adjustments based on Bob's responses."
