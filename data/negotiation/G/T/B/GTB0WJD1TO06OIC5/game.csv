"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate it, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, so how about we meet at $9,150? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, don't you think?",9150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This price is fair and allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'm thinking we're close to a deal, and I'd like to make it happen. How about we meet at $9,000 and call it a day?",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,950. This is a small compromise that will allow us to close the deal. I think we're both close to agreeing on this price, so let's make it happen.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,050, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to give up any more profit on this deal. What do you think?",9050.0,Alice,9,
