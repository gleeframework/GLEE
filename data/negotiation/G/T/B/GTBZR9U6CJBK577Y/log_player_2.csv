"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 to both myself and you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is an excellent chance to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Should you be interested, please let me know promptly so we can finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than your maximum budget of $10,000.  While you could potentially get the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage in doing so. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500."
