"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm thinking of a price around $140 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You are aiming for a price of $150 or lower, and rejecting the first offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good price and closer to your goal, you still have time and leverage. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a price even lower than $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still aiming to stay closer to $130.  Would you consider $132?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference for me."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
