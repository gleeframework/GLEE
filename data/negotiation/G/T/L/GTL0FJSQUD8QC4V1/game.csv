"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1400000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. I'm confident this price will be beneficial for both of us. Let's work together to bridge this gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
