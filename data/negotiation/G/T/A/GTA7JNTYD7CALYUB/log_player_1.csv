"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description - be specific and enticing] that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Enticing Description:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition of the product without revealing too much about my own valuation. This piques Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussion, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll have the fallback option.
* This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  I have room to negotiate for a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially getting a higher price.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With 10 rounds, I have time to explore better options.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is my lower limit, I'd be willing to come down to $9,000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to ""find a middle ground,"" fostering a collaborative negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a logical justification for my counteroffer, stating that it allows for a ""fair profit.""

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move:

* It signals a willingness to negotiate while still holding a strong position.
* It leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again.
*  It keeps the option open to sell to John if Bob's final offer remains too low.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider lowering my price slightly in subsequent rounds, but only if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Good Deal:** $8,500 is a good price considering my minimum is $8,000. It's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and allows me to make a decent profit.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. There's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $8,000, Bob's offer is $500 better. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing a potential higher price.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $8,500 is the most sensible choice at this point. It balances the need for profit with the risk of losing the deal or settling for John's lower offer."
