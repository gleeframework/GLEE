{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his budget, and he has room to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will be willing to come down in price to secure a deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 3 rounds left, Alice's offers are getting closer to Bob's budget but still above his desired price.  There is a high risk that Alice will not be willing to accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price.  It's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000. This avoids further negotiation and ensures a purchase within his budget."
