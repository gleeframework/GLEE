"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation, so it's best to reject and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room to gradually increase our offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, there's potential for a good deal. 
* **John as Leverage:** We always have the option of going to John for $12,000, which gives us some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is my best counteroffer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down considerably, the offer is still above both our target price and John's price. We're getting closer, but it's worth seeing if we can negotiate further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now proposing our maximum price, but phrasing it as a mutually beneficial compromise. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Rounds are progressing. By putting our best offer forward, we encourage Alice to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation.
* **John Option:**  We can always revert to John if Alice completely rejects this offer, so we haven't lost our leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,500. This is my final offer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice is very close to our limit, but we're still losing out compared to John's offer.
* **Final offer bluff:**  Alice stating ""final offer"" might be a negotiation tactic. There's still room to counter, and it's worth seeing if she'll budge slightly.
* **Risk assessment:** We're getting into the later rounds. Rejecting here carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price or not having enough rounds to reach a deal. However, the potential savings of $1500 compared to her offer justify the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move a little bit.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,500? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing willingness to compromise by increasing our offer slightly above our target. 
* **Firm but fair:**  Our message implies this is our final offer while remaining respectful of Alice's position. 
* **Time sensitivity:** With fewer rounds remaining, we need to push towards a decision. This offer keeps us in the game while still aiming for a significant saving compared to Alice's last price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $13,000.  We're unlikely to get a better offer from her at this point.
* **John's Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000.
* **Saving Money:**  Buying from John saves us $1,000 compared to Alice's final offer.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting precious rounds and potentially missing out on both deals. 

It's time to cut our losses with Alice and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
