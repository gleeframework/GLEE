Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $85. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While we could try another counteroffer, there's a risk she'll stick to her price or only come down a dollar or two. It's better to secure the product at $85, a significant savings compared to John's $100 price."
