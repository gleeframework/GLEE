You should reject Alice's offer, as it's still above your desired price. While you can buy from John for $100, you're still willing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get it for less."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Alice's offer is the best you can get. Although you might be able to get a lower price by continuing the negotiation, it's not worth the risk.  Alice might not budge further, and you could end up buying from John for $100.  You're better off accepting the offer and getting the product for a price within your budget."
