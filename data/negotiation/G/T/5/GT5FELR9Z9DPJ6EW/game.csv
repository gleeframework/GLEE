"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $115. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $125. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $122.50. It's a fair compromise.",122.5,Alice,5,
