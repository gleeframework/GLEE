Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. I'll be watching his response closely, and if he rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a small profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
