"I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000, which is the price John is offering. Can we meet in the middle at $1625000?",1625000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1625000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial difference. How about we settle on $1687500? This price reflects the value I believe the product holds for you.",1687500.0,Alice,3,
