Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so we need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

By starting at $950,000, we leave some room for negotiation if Bob counters. However, even if he rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at our desired price."
