Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I appreciate your flexibility.

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away.
* **Potential for Agreement:** Alice is signaling a willingness to finalize the deal, making it more likely that accepting her offer will lead to a successful purchase.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains."
