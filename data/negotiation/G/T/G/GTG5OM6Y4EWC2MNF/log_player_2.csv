# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than the product's value to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You can get the product for $100 from John, which is the best possible price for you."
