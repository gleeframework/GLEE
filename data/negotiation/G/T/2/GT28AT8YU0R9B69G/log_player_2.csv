"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is asking for $150, which is too much.  I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still a reasonable price for me, considering I'm willing to pay up to $120.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my max price of $120. While it's tempting to buy from her, I'm not yet willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going all in with a final counteroffer of $120. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping Alice will recognize that we're both close to a deal. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
