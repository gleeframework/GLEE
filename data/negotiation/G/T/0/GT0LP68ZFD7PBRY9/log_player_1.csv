Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $100 is higher than Bob's value of $80, meaning he'll have to decide if it's worth it to him. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is below your minimum of $120, but it allows for potential negotiation and room for you to make a profit.
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is concise and friendly, and the price is explicitly stated. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still unable to meet your price of $95. I would like to offer $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not profitable enough. Selling to John for $120 is the best option in this scenario. You'll earn your desired profit and avoid further negotiation."
