Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and allows room for potential concessions if needed.  I'm confident Bob will value the product enough to consider it, but I'm also leaving myself open to potentially making a profit beyond my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I am open to negotiating, I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer but still gives me a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm concerned about Bob's negotiation tactics. He seems unwilling to budge significantly.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll secure the sale with him and avoid further haggling."
