"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct & Polite:** The message is direct and polite, acknowledging Alice's offer while stating Bob's position. 
* **Initial Counter:** This offer is Bob's maximum price. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where a deal might be possible.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for continued negotiation, indicating Bob is open to discussion but firm on his initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's budget of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Since there are still rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Bob can still potentially secure a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk of Alice not accepting further counteroffers, there's also a chance of securing the product at a lower price.  The reward outweighs the risk at this point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still over budget:** Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's worth attempting to negotiate further to see if Bob can secure a better price.
* **Potential for a deal:** While the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases, there's still a chance of finding a middle ground and securing the product at a lower price. The potential savings outweigh the risk of failing."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too much for me.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is making a final counteroffer closer to his maximum budget, showing that he is serious about reaching an agreement.

* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget and guaranteed.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a chance to negotiate with Alice, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John, even if it means paying a slightly higher price."
