"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident in the value this product can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $1,020,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This would leave some room for you to profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1020000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,020,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,060,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
