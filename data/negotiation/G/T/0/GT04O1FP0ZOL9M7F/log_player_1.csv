Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob sees its value as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum value. I want to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a price that's too far below what I believe the product is worth. John is offering me a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is closer to my desired price and is a safer option at this point."
