Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this product is significant, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,225,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to find a price that works for both of us.

``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum, and continuing to push for a higher price might push Bob away entirely. It's better to secure a deal at $1,225,000 than risk ending up with John's $1,000,000 offer."
