Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification for the price:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the value to Bob, it emphasizes the ""value and potential,"" subtly implying it's worth a significant investment.
* **Gauging interest:**  This initial offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  His response will help you determine your next move in the negotiation."
