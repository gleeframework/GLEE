"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to get this done.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
