Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to bargain and potentially reach a higher price.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a specific price, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate seriously. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for something closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to get this done."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $11,000, Bob seems firm on his position. Accepting his offer of $10,250 is still a good deal. It's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000 and still leaves me with a good profit margin."
