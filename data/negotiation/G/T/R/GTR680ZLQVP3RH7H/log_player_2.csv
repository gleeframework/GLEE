"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This sets the negotiation in motion and shows Bob's willingness to bargain.  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his desired price.  Rejecting again allows for further negotiation and potentially achieving a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer.  $10,000 is a reasonable middle ground, demonstrating Bob's desire to close the deal but not overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he wants to pay.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially a final price closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob again increases his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. $11,000 is a reasonable midpoint, showing Bob's desire to reach an agreement without exceeding his limit. This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to the price Bob is willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown persistence and a willingness to negotiate, and this suggests that a lower price is still attainable. Rejecting the offer allows for continued bargaining and potentially a final price within Bob's target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his upper limit.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise but is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  It leaves room for a possible final agreement in the next round, especially since Bob is approaching his maximum price and might opt for John's offer if this is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the chances of reaching a satisfactory price are slim.  Alice has shown a willingness to stick to her asking price, and further negotiation would likely result in a price close to or even higher than John's offer. Since John's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's more prudent to buy the product from John and avoid risking a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
