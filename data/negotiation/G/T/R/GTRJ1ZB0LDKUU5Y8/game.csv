I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making a deal?,120.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've already discounted the price from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $110 is still a bit steep for me. How about $105? That's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,115.0
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $105 is a bit low for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going any lower than that. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Alice,5,,
