"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can potentially get it for less. There are 9 rounds left, so it's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This establishes a clear negotiating position. While this might be too low for Alice to accept immediately, it sets the stage for further negotiation within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a better price. While $1,050,000 is closer to his target, he has already shown he's willing to go lower, and there are still 7 rounds left. There's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a more moderate counteroffer, inching closer to Alice's offer but still trying to save money. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm negotiating stance.  The goal is to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, and there's still room to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, especially with fewer rounds left, Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final push for his target price. This counteroffer matches John's price, putting Alice in a difficult position.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has a viable alternative.  This creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Alice to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, it's getting risky to continue negotiating with Alice. Bob has already made a strong counteroffer and is very close to his target price. However, Alice is still willing to negotiate above his target.  It's likely that she will continue to offer prices slightly above $1,000,000. 

There's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's smarter to take the guaranteed deal with John and secure the product for his target price."
