Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $120.
* **Strategic Wording:**  The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
