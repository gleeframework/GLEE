"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** While $175 is a bit above Bob's perceived value, it's not an outrageous number. It's likely to spark a conversation without being immediately rejected. 
* **Openness:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $175. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer shows interest, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage to hold out for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $160 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $160 is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Maintain leverage:** This price leaves room for further negotiation while keeping John's offer as a safety net.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the offer, encouraging Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $150.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:** Right now, John's offer guarantees me my minimum. I can afford to reject Bob and keep negotiating. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and he's clearly interested. Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $155 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  $155 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I get a profit.
* **Appealing to fairness:**  The message emphasizes fairness and uses language like ""meet you halfway"" to encourage Bob to agree. 
* **Final offer before John:** This offer puts the ball in Bob's court. If he doesn't accept, I'm ready to move on to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** While Bob's offer is my minimum, it doesn't leave any room for negotiation or profit.
* **John's offer is equal and guaranteed:**  John's offer is the same as Bob's, but it's a guaranteed sale. I don't need to risk another round of negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is running out:** We are nearing the end of the rounds. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale than risk further negotiation with Bob."
