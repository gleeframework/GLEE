Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might lead to a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Clear Communication:** A direct message with a clear price avoids confusion and encourages a swift decision from Bob."
