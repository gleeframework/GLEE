"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I understand its worth to you might be around $100. However, considering its true worth and the cost involved in providing it, I am offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the balance between the value you receive and my business needs. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
