Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price, giving me room to negotiate. It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly.  I'm hoping this price will spark his interest and encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to sell the product, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully is more appealing to Bob than his initial offer.  This price demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $11,000 is now closer to my minimum. It's a good deal for me,  and I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the next round. Selling to John would only net me $10,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice here."
