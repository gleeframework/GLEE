"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower it further. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice without having to pay John's higher price."
