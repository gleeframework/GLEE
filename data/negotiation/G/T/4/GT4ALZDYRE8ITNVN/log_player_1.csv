Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself. I'll offer it to him for $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $100 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $80, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's higher than his previous offer but still lower than the original price of $150.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was $100, I'll try to get a bit closer to the original price of $150. I'll offer the product to Bob for $110, which is a reasonable compromise.

{""product_price"": 110}"
