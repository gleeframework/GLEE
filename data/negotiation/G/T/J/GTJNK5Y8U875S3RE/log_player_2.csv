"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's not going to budge much further. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her than $1,050,000. Since we can buy it from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to go with John even if it means missing out on a slightly better deal with Alice."
