"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to move closer to your number to make this deal happen. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
