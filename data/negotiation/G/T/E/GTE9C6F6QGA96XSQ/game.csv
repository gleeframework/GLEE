"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives us both a reasonable profit.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
