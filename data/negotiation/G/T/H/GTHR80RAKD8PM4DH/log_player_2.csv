Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below what this product is worth to me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value you've placed on the product while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount of my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!
