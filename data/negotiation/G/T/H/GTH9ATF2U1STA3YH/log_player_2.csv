"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though. How about $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100? I'm not willing to go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has signaled she won't go lower than $100, which matches John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice in further rounds, and it risks missing out on the product altogether."
