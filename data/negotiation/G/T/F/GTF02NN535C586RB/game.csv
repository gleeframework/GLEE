"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $1,050,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still hoping to reach $1,025,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
