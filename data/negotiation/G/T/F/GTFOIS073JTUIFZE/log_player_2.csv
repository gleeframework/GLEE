"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we discuss a price that reflects its worth. Considering the product's quality and your anticipated use, I propose a price of $120. This allows us to reach a fair agreement while ensuring you receive a product that meets your expectations. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Bob ($150).  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still acquire the product from John for $150, which is his maximum price."
