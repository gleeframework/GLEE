Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  That's a good price for both of us and gets the deal done quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $1,150,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
