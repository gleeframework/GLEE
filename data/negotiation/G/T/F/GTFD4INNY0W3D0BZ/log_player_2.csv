"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum value for the product ($1,500,000).  While $1,200,000 is a good price, I can likely get it for less by negotiating with Alice.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  That's a good price for both of us and gets the deal done quickly."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $1,150,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is within my budget and a good price considering John is asking for $1,500,000. It's a good deal for both of us. I'll accept the offer."
