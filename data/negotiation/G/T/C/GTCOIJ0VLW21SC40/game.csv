"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Considering my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be happy to offer you $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1750000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique value.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1625000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident that we can close this deal.  What do you think?",1625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer.  However, $1625000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1687500. This reflects the true value of the product while remaining fair to both of us. Let's close this deal!",1687500.0,Alice,5,
