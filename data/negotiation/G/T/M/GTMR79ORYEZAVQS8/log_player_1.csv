Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's far below my minimum."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. He's clearly not willing to go much higher, and I've already made significant concessions. Rather than risk wasting more time and potentially getting a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
