"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research, I believe a fair price for this product would be $800,000. I'm open to negotiating a bit higher, but I'm not willing to go over $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer.  While $850,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a higher return, but $1,025,000 is still too much for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
