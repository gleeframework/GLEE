"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is quite tight. I am willing to offer $9,800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  It's a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650? This is still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000, and it gives me a bit more flexibility.",10650.0,Alice,3,
