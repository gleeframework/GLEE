"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $10,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a significant increase from your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.
