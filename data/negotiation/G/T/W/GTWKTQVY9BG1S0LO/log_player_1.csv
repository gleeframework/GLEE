Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob and highlight the value of the product. 
* **Plan B:**  By having John as a backup, I have leverage to end negotiations if Bob's counteroffers become too low. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll likely accept a price closer to $10,000-$11,000 if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating.
* **Potential to Reach a Better Price:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range, even if Bob's initial offer is low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is too far below my value.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear boundary.
* **Compromise:**  It's a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial bid.
* **Clear Communication:** I am stating my value and providing a reason for my counteroffer.
* **Focus on Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the possibility of a deal and encouraging Bob to come back with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm trying to keep it closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I'm  not under pressure to sell quickly, as I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Even though Bob has shown some movement, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above $7,500.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,250.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  This counteroffer at $8,250 is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer but remains closer to my desired price range. 
* **Focus on Fair Price:** I emphasize ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see this as a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Close the Deal:**  I'm framing this as a way to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations. 
* **Last Counter-Offer?:** This could be my last counteroffer before considering selling to John, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
