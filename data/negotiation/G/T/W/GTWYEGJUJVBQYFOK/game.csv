Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm and believe in the value of unique items like this. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1780000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $1825000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $1825000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle, but that's as low as I can go. I'll meet you at $1812500. That's my final offer.",1812500.0,Alice,9,
