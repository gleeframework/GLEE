Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget.

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm on his $850,000 offer.  This price is significantly above my minimum, and further negotiation risks losing him entirely. It's a solid profit, so accepting is the most logical choice now."
