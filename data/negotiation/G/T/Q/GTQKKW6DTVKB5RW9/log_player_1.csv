"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going all out, so there's room for me to lower the price during the negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal. 

**Remember, my goal is to maximize my profit, but I also need to balance that with keeping Bob engaged and potentially closing a deal.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  
* **I have 8 rounds remaining, and selling to John for $12,000 is always an option.**  There's still potential to get closer to my target price with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  
* **There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially with John as a backup.** I'm happy to accept this deal and move on."
