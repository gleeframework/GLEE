"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for negotiation, and we'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to our target, we're still aiming to get the best possible deal. There's room for further negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're proposing a compromise that's slightly closer to Alice's latest offer while still representing a good discount from her initial price and keeping us below our $100 limit. Let's see if she's willing to accept."
