"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than $900,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a gesture of good faith. This price still reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has a high value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
