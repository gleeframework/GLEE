"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $12,500 for the product?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $13,500, and $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",13750.0,Alice,5,
