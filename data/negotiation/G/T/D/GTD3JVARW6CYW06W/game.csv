"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $175?",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $190? I'm confident you'll love the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make it work for both of us.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $190 is slightly above my preferred budget. Could we perhaps aim for $180? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still willing to make a deal. How about we meet at $185? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to let it go for that amount.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. However, based on my budget considerations, I am unable to accept $185. Would it be possible to consider $180 as a final offer? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial solution.",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $185, Bob. I'm willing to make a final offer to you. If you're not willing to meet me at $185, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. So, my final offer is $185. Take it or leave it.",185.0,Alice,7,
