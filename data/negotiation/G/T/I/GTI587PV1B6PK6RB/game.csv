"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. I'm proposing a price of $1,037,500 for the product. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, I'm on a tight budget, and anything over $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  My final offer is $990,000.  If you can't do that, I'll have to explore other options.",990000.0,Bob,6,
