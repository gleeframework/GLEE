"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $60. Would you be willing to go down that low?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal at $80 and I'll get the product shipped to you right away.",80.0,Alice,5,
