{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $60. Would you be willing to go down that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering $85, which is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal at $80 and I'll get the product shipped to you right away."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering $80, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's above Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.  I'm also emphasizing a quick and easy transaction to encourage him to accept."
