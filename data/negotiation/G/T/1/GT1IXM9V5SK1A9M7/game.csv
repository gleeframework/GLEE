"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $8,000.  Would you consider $8,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,125? This would be a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to do $8,900 to get this done today. What do you say?",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're so close! I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to lose this opportunity. Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Alice,7,
