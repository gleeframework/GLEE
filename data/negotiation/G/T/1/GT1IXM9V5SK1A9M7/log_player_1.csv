"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $8,000.  Would you consider $8,750? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially with 6 rounds remaining.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,125? This would be a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to do $8,900 to get this done today. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,900 is tempting, I still feel I can get closer to my desired price point. There are still 4 rounds remaining.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close! I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it would be a shame to lose this opportunity. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
