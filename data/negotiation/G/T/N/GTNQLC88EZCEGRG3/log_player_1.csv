Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $11,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my best offer.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate and potentially running out of rounds."
