{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum value of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob. This should hopefully encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and hopefully reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum value, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $115? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than what I initially wanted, but it's still a decent profit for me, and it avoids the risk of having to negotiate further or selling to John for a lower price."
