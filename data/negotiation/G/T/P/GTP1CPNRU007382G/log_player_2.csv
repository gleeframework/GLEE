"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My minimum acceptable offer is $800,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's minimum:** Alice stated her minimum acceptable price is $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your maximum:** Your maximum is $1,500,000 (John's price). 
* **Large difference:** There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($1,200,000) and both her minimum and your maximum.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable. This might encourage Alice to come down closer to her minimum.  Even if she doesn't significantly reduce the price, you still have the option to buy from John."
