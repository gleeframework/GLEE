Round 7
Alice's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate but is very stubbornly holding onto a price above your absolute limit. It's unlikely she'll come down to $80, especially with several rounds left.  You're better off taking John's guaranteed offer and avoiding the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
