"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. Unfortunately, $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $60. How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $75? That would be a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $85? That's my final offer for now.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $85 is close to what I had in mind.  Would you consider $80? That's the most I can offer.",80.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $80. How about $82.50?",82.5,Alice,7,
