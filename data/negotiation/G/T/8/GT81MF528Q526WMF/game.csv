"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're on a budget, $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 simply won't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
