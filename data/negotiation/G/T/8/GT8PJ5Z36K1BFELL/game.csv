"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. How about $10,900? This is my final offer. If you agree, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10900.0,Alice,5,
