"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to the value I see in the product? Would $800,000 be acceptable to you?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000 to facilitate a quick sale. This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely.  Let's get this deal done.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a fair price for both of us. Considering the value I place on the product, how about we aim for $750,000? I believe this would be a win-win situation.",750000.0,Bob,4,
