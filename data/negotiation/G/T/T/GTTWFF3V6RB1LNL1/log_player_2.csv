"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're trying to get the best price possible, and $140 is still higher than your target of $120.  It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to adjust my offer slightly. I propose we meet in the middle and agree on a price of $137.50 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$137.50 is still more than your target of $120. You can likely negotiate further and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on my previous offer and offer $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I'm willing to offer the product at $132.50. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still above your target price of $120, and John is offering a better deal.  You're likely to get a lower price from Alice if you keep negotiating, but there's a risk she'll reject your next offer.  It's worth seeing what you can do with a counteroffer, but you need to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still a bit above my budget at $132.50.  I'm willing to go up to $130,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
