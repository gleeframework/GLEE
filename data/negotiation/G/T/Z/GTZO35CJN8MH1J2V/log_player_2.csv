{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? Let's keep this negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
