Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is open to discussion, making Bob feel like he can counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial price. However, since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, she has leverage to walk away if Bob's offer is too low."
