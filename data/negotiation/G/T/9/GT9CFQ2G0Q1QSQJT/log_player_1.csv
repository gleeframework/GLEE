"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down while still achieving a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from his initial offer. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product and be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a compromise on my end, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap.  I hope Bob will recognize this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are down to 4 rounds remaining, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining time. It's time to take the sure thing.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
