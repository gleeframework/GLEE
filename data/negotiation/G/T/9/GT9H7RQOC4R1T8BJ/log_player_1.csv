Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the compromise we've reached so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to offer a price that's significantly closer to your $1,500,000 minimum. His counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
