Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm not going too high, as this could immediately lead to rejection. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer until we reach a mutually agreeable price, or I can sell to John for my minimum price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay $85 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still a possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price through counter-offers.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I can always choose to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob break down. This provides a safety net and allows me to leverage John's offer as a bargaining chip.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I will now counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to reach a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, falling exactly between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  While $95 is lower than my ideal price, it still allows me to make a decent profit and avoids selling to John at my minimum price of $120.
* **Positive & Solution-Oriented:** The message is friendly and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties. This creates a positive atmosphere for continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating my flexibility while also maintaining a price that is acceptable to me. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to reconsider and reach an agreement.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to make further counteroffers or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better solution. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $30 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This is a significant improvement from his previous offer of $85.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would prefer to sell for closer to $100,  there's a chance that Bob might be willing to go higher in the next round if I reject his offer. However, there's no guarantee.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Selling to John for $120 eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures I get my minimum price. However, it also means missing out on the potential for a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer represents a calculated risk. It's a compromise that allows me to make a decent profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation. While I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of ending up with a lower price or even no sale makes this offer attractive."
