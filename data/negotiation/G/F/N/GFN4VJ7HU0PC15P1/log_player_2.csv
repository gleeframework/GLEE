"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks that will make it even more valuable to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Even though Alice mentions ""additional perks,"" it's not worth paying $2,000 extra. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John is the most financially sound choice in this scenario."
