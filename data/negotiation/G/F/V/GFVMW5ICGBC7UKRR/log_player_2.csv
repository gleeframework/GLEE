Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $730,000. I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of $735,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but in smaller increments now.  While we could push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll become less flexible. Accepting at $735,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
