"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This allows for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob, making him consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my value and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? This is a great deal for a product you'll really enjoy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $95.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to incentivize acceptance. 
* **Reiteration of Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While it's closer to my desired value, I believe further negotiation could yield a better outcome.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  John remains a reliable alternative at $100, providing a buffer against a potential deal breakdown.

I'll counter with another offer, but I'm also mindful of the limited rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? Let's close this deal and you can start enjoying the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price to $90, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly highlighting the need to close the deal and emphasizing the benefits of starting to enjoy the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and engaging tone to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and reaching an agreement within the limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, there is not enough time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible option given the limited time and the low offers from Bob."
