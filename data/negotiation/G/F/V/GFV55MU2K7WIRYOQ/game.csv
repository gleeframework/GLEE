"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $1000000 for it.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's lower than its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
