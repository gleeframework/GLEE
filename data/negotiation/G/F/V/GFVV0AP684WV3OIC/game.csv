"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,150. I'd like to make a revised offer of $10,900. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10900.0,Bob,4,
