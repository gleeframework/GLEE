"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer is too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. There are still rounds left, so I don't want to jump to buying from John just yet."

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still above it. I'm confident we can negotiate further, as Alice has already shown flexibility in her counteroffers. There are still rounds left, so I'll continue to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,290,000 is still a bit above my ideal price. Let's find a sweet spot that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close, but it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. With only 3 rounds left, I don't have much room to negotiate further. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at my desired price.  It's a guaranteed deal, and I'm confident that I can get the product for less than what Alice is currently offering."
