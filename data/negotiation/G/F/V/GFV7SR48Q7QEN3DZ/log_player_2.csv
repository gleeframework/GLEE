Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $155, and John offers the product at $150. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the $5."
