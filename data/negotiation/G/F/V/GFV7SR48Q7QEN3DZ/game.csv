"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! While I agree it looks valuable, $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. How about $140? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",155.0,Alice,5,
