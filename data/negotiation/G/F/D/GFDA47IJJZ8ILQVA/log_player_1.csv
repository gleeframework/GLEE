Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to justify this price, and it's a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I'm not thrilled about the possibility of a prolonged negotiation, I'm willing to push for a better price.  I'll counteroffer, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's lower initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting uncomfortably close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk a protracted negotiation further.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much safer and less stressful option.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
