Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to consider, given he's already offered $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to $1,000,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for a potential compromise with Bob. I believe this offer is fair and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm starting to feel like it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm concerned that this negotiation could go on for too long. To avoid the risk of further time wasted and a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
