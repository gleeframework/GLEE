"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $180. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $120, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $140. This is a good compromise and I'm happy to close the deal. It's a better price than what John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
