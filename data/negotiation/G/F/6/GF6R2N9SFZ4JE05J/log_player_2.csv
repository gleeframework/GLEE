"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique asset that's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm confident it holds significant value for the right buyer, and I believe you might be that person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This price reflects the value I place on it, while also leaving room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's potential value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and leaves room for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is below my minimum valuation, I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,750,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price.  While I could buy from John for $1,000,000, there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
