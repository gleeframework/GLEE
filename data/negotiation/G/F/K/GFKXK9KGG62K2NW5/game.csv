"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me to accept outright, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
