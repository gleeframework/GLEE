,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? That's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $130? That's still a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for something closer to $125.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I think we can make a deal.",127.0,Bob,4,
