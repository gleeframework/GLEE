"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still too high. You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting and countering is the best option for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is getting closer to your budget, you're still aiming for a lower price. You have several rounds left, so rejecting and countering again is the better strategy to potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price, but still not quite there. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a lower price.  You have several rounds remaining, so continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $9,750.  This is a very fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,750, which would be $9,875. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're very close to your target price, but you've already had six rounds of negotiation. There's a chance you can continue to negotiate, but it's possible Alice will be unwilling to come down further, and you'll be left with very little room to negotiate.  It's better to take the safe option now and buy from John for $8,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
