"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's the lowest I can go.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $92 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $93? This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $91? That's the absolute lowest I can go.",91.0,Bob,6,
