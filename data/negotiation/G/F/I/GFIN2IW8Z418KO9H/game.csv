"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $8500 for it, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your potential gain. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $9500, which is a significant step up from my initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9500. I'm offering you the product for $10000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
