"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $15000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14200 for it. This is my final offer for now.",14200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $13500? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $13500 is enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $14300 for it. This is my next best offer.",14300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14300 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13900?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13900. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14400 for it. This is my next best offer.",14400.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go up to $14100, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",14100.0,Bob,8,
