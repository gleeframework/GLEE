"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1300000. This is a competitive price that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great opportunity. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counter-counteroffer of $1250000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1220000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to give up too much. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1235000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",1235000.0,Alice,5,
