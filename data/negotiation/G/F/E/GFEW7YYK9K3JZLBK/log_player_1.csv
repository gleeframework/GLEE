"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  Highlighting the value of the product to Bob can incentivize him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message conveys willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate and potentially increase his offer.
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, as he's already shown interest and is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial proposals. How about $1,300,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to work towards a deal. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Setting a Clear Goal:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is nearing my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. He's shown willingness to increase his offer.
* **Opportunity to secure a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially push him closer to my target price.

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, as he's already shown a willingness to compromise and we've had a few rounds of productive negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we split the difference?  $1,275,000 would be a fair price, and it's a good compromise.  This gives us both a win and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not accepting his offer but still pushing for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering a price halfway between his last offer ($1,250,000) and my last offer ($1,300,000) shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I use the phrase ""split the difference"" to emphasize that it's a fair solution for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I remain positive and focus on the benefits of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,225,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to my target.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,500,000.  

While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of a prolonged negotiation and a final price lower than my minimum is too high.  Selling to John ensures a secure and profitable outcome."
