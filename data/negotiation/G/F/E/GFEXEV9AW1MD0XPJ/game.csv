"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product and I think you'll really appreciate its value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $95? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $99? It's a good price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth.",99.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the closest I can get to my desired price without going too low. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $99, I think that's a fair price that we can both agree on.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $100. I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $98. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",98.0,Alice,9,
