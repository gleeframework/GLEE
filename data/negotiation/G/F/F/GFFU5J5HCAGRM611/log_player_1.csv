{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances a few things:

* **My minimum:** It's above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Bob's value:** It's below what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential benefit.
* **Negotiation space:** It leaves room for negotiation, so Bob might feel encouraged to counteroffer. 

I'm not going to immediately sell to John because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to that price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135? That leaves a little room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $132.50 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with selling it that low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push it higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  $132.50 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $134.  That's my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 134} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $134 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $129 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely that we'll be able to reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which guarantees me my minimum desired price."
