"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $1,500,000 to you. As a first-time offer, I'm proposing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an asset that could significantly increase in value over time.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I understand your budget constraints and would like to make a counteroffer. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its original value and should still provide you with a good return on investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to hear that you're considering a deal, Bob. After careful consideration, I'd like to offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my target price.  Let's try $1,105,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to sell the product to you for $1,112,500. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1112500.0,Alice,7,
