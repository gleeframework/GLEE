"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,4,
