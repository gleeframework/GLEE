``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price a bit further. If he accepts, I'll make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, I'm not desperate and can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations or selling to John.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $9,800. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, although it's closer than before. However, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John.  I will counteroffer Bob again, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a final offer from my side. Please consider it carefully, as I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 10200}
