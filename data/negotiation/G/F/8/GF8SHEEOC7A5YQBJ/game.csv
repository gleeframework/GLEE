"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $9,800. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a final offer from my side. Please consider it carefully, as I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the price.",10200.0,Alice,5,
